TODO LIST:

- Test names and companies provided, save results

    Write script to queue test cases, count number of names and let Inriskable know (reply email) so they increase count of tokens

- EDA based on tests -> Yanis send over articles with their sentiment scores
    Types of EDA to check on
        Timing (how long does it take to process)
            Article summary and sentiment tagging
        Will we get rate limited if we keep pinging the news server
        How many articles per entity at different time steps (also how many no time step)
    Ping Yanis for examples when stuff is fixed
    Start on EDA script for existing pull
        Distribution of sentiment scores

- Deduplication of articles

    Inriskable said that they do topical deduplication on their backend, so we just need to count repeats in the case where individual/company returns exact same articles
    Check with LEDR on this

- Isolate repository and write documentation

    Wrap up and send to LEDR (Yay!)
    

DONE LIST:

- Incorporate individuals search
    Done - Extended existing function to work for individuals, switch entity type based on whether name exists in individual or company list 

- Add in Chinese search functionality
    Done - Check language of name and send request accordingly -> If name is in non-detected language just try sending both (Should work based on how Inriskable does search)
    Now that Chinese articles returned need to add new models for summary and sentiment scoring -> Refer to testing in TODO above
