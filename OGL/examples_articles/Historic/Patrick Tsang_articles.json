        "content": "While small-cap stocks, such as HMV Digital China Group Limited (HKG:8078) with\nits market cap of HK$3.13b, are popular for their explosive growth, investors\nshould also be aware of their balance sheet to judge whether the company can\nsurvive a downturn. Since 8078 is loss-making right now, it\u2019s crucial to assess\nthe current state of its operations and pathway to profitability. Here are a few\nbasic checks that are good enough to have a broad overview of the company\u2019s\nfinancial strength. Though, given that I have not delve into the\ncompany-specifics, I suggest you dig deeper yourself into 8078 here.\n\n\nDOES 8078 PRODUCE ENOUGH CASH RELATIVE TO DEBT?\n\n8078's debt level has been constant at around HK$146.06m over the previous year\ncomprising of short- and long-term debt. At this current level of debt, 8078\ncurrently has HK$175.43m remaining in cash and short-term investments for\ninvesting into the business. Moving onto cash from operations, its operating\ncash flow is not yet significant enough to calculate a meaningful cash-to-debt\nratio, indicating that operational efficiency is something we\u2019d need to take a\nlook at. As the purpose of this article is a high-level overview, I won\u2019t be\nlooking at this today, but you can take a look at some of 8078\u2019s operating\nefficiency ratios such as ROA here.\n\n\nCAN 8078 MEET ITS SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS WITH THE CASH IN HAND?\n\nLooking at 8078\u2019s most recent HK$340.00m liabilities, it seems that the business\nhas been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of\nHK$709.49m, leading to a 2.09x current account ratio. Generally, for Media\ncompanies, this is a reasonable ratio as there's enough of a cash buffer without\nholding too capital in low return investments.\n\nSEHK:8078 Historical Debt June 28th 18\n\n\nDOES 8078 FACE THE RISK OF SUCCUMBING TO ITS DEBT-LOAD?\n\n8078\u2019s level of debt is appropriate relative to its total equity, at 16.24%.\n8078 is not taking on too much debt commitment, which can be restrictive and\nrisky for equity-holders. Investors' risk associated with debt is very low with\n8078, and the company has plenty of headroom and ability to raise debt should it\nneed to in the future.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\nAlthough 8078\u2019s debt level is relatively low, its cash flow levels still could\nnot copiously cover its borrowings. This may indicate room for improvement in\nterms of its operating efficiency. However, the company exhibits an ability to\nmeet its near term obligations should an adverse event occur. This is only a\nrough assessment of financial health, and I'm sure 8078 has company-specific\nissues impacting its capital structure decisions. I suggest you continue to\nresearch HMV Digital China Group to get a more holistic view of the stock by\nlooking at:\n\n 1. Historical Performance: What has 8078's returns been like over the past?

They are supporting HR leaders, employers, and employees to\nnavigate a dynamic labour environment.\u202f\u00a0\n\nCanada\u2019s HR leaders who took part in CHRR\u2019s survey listed reasons\u00a0for why they\nengage this year\u2019s 5-Star Employment Lawyers and Law Firms: \u202f\u00a0\n\n * \u201cWorkplace Investigations\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cCOVID-related matters\u201d \u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cTerminations/arbitration\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cUnion grievances\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cWrongful dismissal claims\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cHuman rights/disability/accommodation issues\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cDevelopment and interpretation of policies legislated by the Ontario\n   government\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n * \u201cRemote work arrangements\u201d\u00a0\n\n> \u201cAll lawyers are going to be competent and will be able to tell you what the\n> law is. What sets good lawyers apart from most lawyers is someone\u2019s advice\n> that you can trust\u201d\n> \u00a0Lai-King Hum, Hum Law Firm \u00a0\n\nThe 31 employment lawyers and 26 employment law firms are not only recognized as\nbest-in-class by clients who have retained them, but also by the peers who would\nconfidently recommend their abilities. The 2023 honorees\u2019 legal peers, consulted\nin CHRR\u2019s survey, said of them:\u00a0\n\n * \u201cThey can be aggressive or conciliatory when needed, always keeping in mind\n   that a negotiated outcome is often the best result\u201d\u00a0\n * \u201cSeasoned, experienced, and excellent\u201d\u00a0\n * \u201cNot only excellent lawyers but are practical and professional\u201d\u00a0\n * \u201cHighly skilled\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe best employment lawyers or firms are the ones that have been diligent and\nintentional to stay on top of the rapidly evolving changes that have impacted\nthe workplace,\u201d says Laura Williams, managing partner at Williams HR Law LLP.\n\u201cThey go beyond simply advising their clients of what they can and cannot do,\nbut also provide them with how they can navigate risks and exposures to\nliability while meeting their strategic objectives.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEST EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ONE STEP AHEAD\n\nHum Law Firm\u2019s principal and senior lawyer, Lai-King Hum, utilizes an effective\nstrategy to enable her clients to benefit. She notes that one of the biggest\nchallenges for her employer clients is staying current and in compliance with\n\u201clightning quick changes to the law\u201d.\u00a0\n\nThe 5-Star winner and her team at the boutique employment law firm in Toronto\nproduce employer alerts immediately after important changes to the law, a\nvalue-added service her clients say often beats the bigger firms in terms of\nspeed.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe care about our clients, and it is something that requires us to be on our\ntoes to keep track of all the changes and the case law,\u201d Hum says.\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe top employment law firm represents employers and employees, although Hum\nhandles more of the employer-side cases. It\u2019s an ongoing relationship she refers\nto as a \u201cmini marriage\u201d.\u202f\u00a0\n\nHum is also a seasoned investigator and has done a range of investigations,\nincluding representing employees who have made complaints as well as\nrepresenting the people about whom the employees have complained.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe last few years have seen a rise in workplace harassment and discrimination\ncomplaints, and Hum has acted as the investigator in those cases to assess\nwhether a complaint has been substantiated. She has earned a sterling reputation\nas an adept third-party mediator who can assess what both sides want while\nfinding common ground.\u202f\u00a0\n\nIn CHRR\u2019s survey, respondents gave Hum a rating of\u00a099.4%. One-third of HR\nleaders surveyed said they had worked with Hum and her firm the most in the past\ntwo years.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cOne of the pleasurable things, for me, is when an individual client refers\nothers,\u201d says Hum.\u202f\u00a0\n\n> \u201cNobody practices dentistry on their own teeth so nobody should practice law\n> on their own, even lawyers. Everybody needs support and advice from a\n> third-party perspective\u201d\n> \u00a0Nancy Shapiro, Koskie Minsky LLP\n\n\nWHAT SETS CANADA\u2019S BEST EMPLOYMENT LAW FIRMS APART?\u202f\n\nRichard B. Johnson, partner at Ascent Employment Law Corporation, emphasizes\nthat delivering for clients cannot be understated. He says, \u201cA really great\nemployment law firm will be very practical, they will find solutions for their\nclients. You don't want to have to pay out claims and create bad precedence, so\nthey're very good at managing risk and giving practical advice.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTwo-time best employment lawyer Nancy Shapiro, a partner at award-winning firm\nKoskie Minsky LLP, specializes in labour and employment law and has earned the\nrespect of her peers.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nA survey respondent describes Shapiro and her colleagues as \u201cnot only excellent\nlawyers, but they are practical and professional in all of their dealings with\ncounsel, whether on the same side or opposing\u201d.\u202f\u00a0\n\nShapiro was drawn to employment law because she enjoyed the personal nature of\nthe work and felt she could make a difference in her clients\u2019 lives, whether\nthey were individuals or corporations.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cEmployee clients tend to be somewhat emotional from time to time, but I\nencourage them to think of their issue as a business issue and deal with it that\nway,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut I do feel like I\u2019m a quasi-therapist sometimes.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n\nShapiro acknowledges that small and medium-sized employers face significant\nchallenges in keeping pace with the changes in employment law.\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe firm runs client seminars, sends out bulletins, and regularly posts\nemployment law updates to its blog to encourage clients to reach out for advice\nbefore they act.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe can give quick advice on matters that is a cost-effective way for even small\nemployers because we know what we\u2019re talking about and we don\u2019t need to research\nthings,\u201d says Shapiro.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWHAT SKILLS HAVE THE BEST EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS HAD TO MASTER?\n\nOne of the changes brought about by the pandemic that sparks ongoing discussion\namong Hum\u2019s employer clients is the shift to hybrid work. That presents the\nunique challenge of how to monitor employees working from home when employers\nhave an obligation under the Employment Standards Act to keep track of hours and\novertime.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a legal issue because everyone knows they\u2019re supposed to keep\ntrack of hours, but it\u2019s a practical issue,\u201d she explains. \u201cHow do you do it\nwhen people are working from home? You\u2019re not going to put in a monitor in a\nprivate home.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n\nSo, what sets Hum and her firm apart in a crowded field of contenders in this\nyear\u2019s best employment lawyers and law firms?\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor the most part, all lawyers are going to be competent and will be able to\ntell you what the law is,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat sets good lawyers apart from most\nlawyers is someone\u2019s advice that you can trust. I have enough base of experience\nto guide you through the situation to the practical solution that takes into\nconsideration what the client wants.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\n\nThis is echoed by Johnson. \u201cIt should be a relationship. You should be able to\nask anything of your employment lawyer and if it's something that they can\nhandle, great. If it's something they can't handle, you want a lawyer who's\ngoing to provide a trusted referral.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTHE BEST EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ARE INVALUABLE SPECIALISTS\n\nThe most common issues that have come across Shapiro\u2019s desk in the past year\ndeal with employee terminations and exits, specifically in the areas of\nrestrictive covenant agreements and executive compensation plans. This\nrepresents a major shift from the hiring issues that preceded it.\u202f\u00a0\n\nHowever, perhaps the biggest challenge for employees in getting access to\njustice is the judicial and court system itself. \u201cIt is expensive to properly\nlitigate an action and it takes a long time,\u201d says Shapiro.\u202f\u00a0\n\nWhile most employment cases settle before trial, Shapiro has noticed over the\nlast several years that there\u2019s more willingness by companies to take matters to\ntrial and cause the employees to go the distance.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just a trend that\u2019s going to flip again, but I think it\nmight be related to the fact that the whole court system is so backlogged and\n[employers] can take advantage of the time that it takes to get a matter to\ncourt,\u201d she explains.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nShapiro has represented her peers when they are departing law firms and she\nprides herself on her ability to stick-handle matters promptly \u2013 and with great\nresults.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNobody practices dentistry on their own teeth, so nobody should practice law on\ntheir own, even lawyers. Everybody needs support and advice from a third-party\nperspective,\u201d she says. \u201cWe excel in assisting employers and employees in\ngetting the right strategic plan for their needs and helping them work toward\nthat desired outcome in the best way possible.\u201d\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nLAWYERS\n\n * \n\n * \n\n * Alison Adam\n   Partner\n   McLennan Ross LLP\n * Amanda Ovaici\n   Associate Lawyer\n   Osuji & Smith Lawyers\n * Carman J.

        "content": "Pakistan held its general elections on 8 February 2024 across the country,\nwhich, in addition to being marred by various forms of violations of fundamental\nrights of its citizens, are a reminder of the persistent authoritarianism and\nformulated controls deployed by governments for generations to come. We now have\nnews of a new eight-party coalition government finally being formed, several\nweeks after no single party won a majority vote.\n\nThe country\u2019s political history is replete with examples of dictatorial\ninterference with the public mandate. This is exactly what happened in the\nlead-up to the February 8 polls. Witnessing one popular leader, Imran Khan \u2013\nformer prime minister and founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) \u2013 being\njailed, and allowing another, Nawaz Sharif \u2013 the thrice-ousted premier and chief\nof the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) \u2013 on bail to fully participate in\ntheir electoral campaigns gave many of us a profound sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was\n2018 all over again.\n\nWhat makes the recent elections of 2024 unique is the use of technology as well\nas the denial of its access in the lead-up to polling day. The last\ndemocratically elected prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s party, PTI, has a history of\nusing social media to be noticed in the public domain and garner young people\u2019s\nsupport over the past two decades. It inspired other mainstream political\nparties to make online platforms an active part of their outreach strategies.\nUnfortunately, Pakistan is one of the many countries consistently being accorded\nbold headlines in major publications and dismal ranking by rights watchdogs\naround the world for its repeated attempts to control the rights of its citizens\non the internet, which mirror the similar level of physical control the state\nhas historically exercised through the decades.\n\nContinuing the trend of legal actions against journalists and even content\ncreators for merely doing their job, a month before the elections the country\u2019s\nFederal Investigation Agency (FIA), which has been challenged in court time and\nagain for misusing its powers, reportedly sent 65 notices to journalists,\nYouTubers and media persons, accusing them of spreading disinformation against\nthe judiciary; 47 of these notices were issued to journalists alone. Such\ntactics of intimidation and harassment transpire into stifling of rights to\nfreedom of speech and press freedom during critical events, like the recent\nelections in the country.\n\nAccording to Sadaf Khan, digital rights expert and consortium manager of the\nSafety for Voices initiative at APC, various governments in Pakistan have used\nlegal instruments \u2013 such as the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Prevention of\nElectronic Crimes Act, 2016 (commonly known as PECA) \u2014 to initiate internet\nshowdowns and platform takedowns, usually during high political activity,\ndemonstrations, and, of course, elections. \u201cHowever, what\u2019s really unprecedented\nthis time is that there is no transparency around internet shutdowns from the\ngovernment,\u201d said Khan, who also co-founded the nonprofit, Media Matters for\nDemocracy (MMfD). Referring to the intermittent blocking of X in Pakistan, Khan\nsaid, \u201cIt\u2019s creating a lot more uncertainty in an environment where\nmisinformation and disinformation are already rife. In a situation where the\nelection results are being contested by a lot of voters\u2026 creating hurdles in the\nflow of information just adds to more confusion.\u201d Khan added that such shutdowns\nalso reduce people\u2019s access to the \u201cinformation that they need to make valid\npolitical decisions\u201d.\n\nUNEXPLAINED INTERNET DISRUPTIONS AND FORMULATED CONTROLS\n\nAs PTI\u2019s Imran Khan remained incarcerated throughout the election period, his\nparty kicked off its campaign with a \u201cvirtual rally\u201d on 17 December\u00a0 2023. It\nfeatured an AI-generated audio speech by the leader based on the notes he sent\nto party members through his lawyers. Shortly after the event went live, reports\nof internet disruptions emerged from different parts of the country, outages\nthat were later confirmed by NetBlocks, which monitors internet disruptions\naround the world.\n\nSimilarly, on 7 January 2024, PTI\u2019s fundraising telethon for the elections was\ndisrupted by a connectivity blockade again. The government responded to\ncriticism with a surreptitiously vague response, saying such internet\ndisruptions could continue for the next \u201ctwo to three months\u201d, citing the\n\u201cupgradation\u201d of a \u201csystem\u201d. Just weeks before the election, the PTI\u2019s official\nwebsites were blocked, and an imposter website with a misleading candidates list\nsurfaced. However, PTI\u2013 already adept at digital media \u2013 came up with\nalternatives, including a messaging bot that provided information to its\nsupporters about the party\u2019s candidates and their electoral symbols.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe general elections of 2024 were as much a digital war amongst political\nparties as they were a war for votes. Where one party was strategically denied\nfrom effectively executing its electoral campaign, other parties favoured by the\nmilitary at the moment were trying everything to ensure they remain favoured.\n\nJust three days before the election, Gohar Ejaz, the then-caretaker interior\nminister, hinted at the possibility of suspending internet services on polling\nday, citing \u201csecurity threats\u201d. The announcement opened the floodgates to\nresponses laden with protest on social media as well as concerns that the\nstatement itself hinted at potential electoral meddling. On polling day,\nPakistanis woke up to the suspension of mobile internet services despite the\nSindh High Court (SHC)\u2019s orders to the country\u2019s telecom regulator, the Pakistan\nTelecommunication Authority (PTA), to ensure uninterrupted internet access till\nelections, and PTA assuring citizens that internet services would remain\naccessible throughout polling day. The sudden and stealthy blocking of mobile\ninternet only served to expose the government\u2019s repeated and insincere\nassurances of holding \u201cfree and fair elections\u201d.\n\nThe unannounced connectivity outage not only hindered citizens\u2019 ability to\naccess important polling information (such as details about their polling\nstations that the election commission shared through SMS service), it also\ndisconnected them from essential daily services, including healthcare,\ncommunication and mobility. Moreover, the suspension of mobile internet heavily\nimpacted the electoral coverage, primarily from journalists and reporters on the\nfield, which resulted in delayed delivery of information to newsrooms regarding\ncrucial developments at polling stations and preliminary voting outcomes.\nCitizens were stripped of their right to express their opinion on social media\non a day the future of their nation was being decided, and were left in a state\nof uncertainty as to what the internet suspension on such an important day would\nprecipitate in the electoral sphere eventually.\n\nFIGHTING ELECTORAL DISINFORMATION: 2018 VS 2024\n\nIn Pakistan, a country already lagging behind in the tech race and critically\nstruggling with a lack of basic digital literacy, the need for resources to\ncounter disinformation and other kinds of information disorder is undeniable,\nespecially for newsrooms. During the 2024 general elections, we registered a\nmixed response from media professionals and journalists about the extent to\nwhich disinformation was deployed by political parties to propagate their\nagendas. Some viral misleading items included digitally altered videos of\nseveral PTI candidates announcing their boycott of the elections and,\nironically, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA)\u2019s claim there was no internet\nshutdown in the country.\n\nAyesha Khalid, a former journalist now co-leading a digital investigation\ninitiative called Facter along with me at MMfD, said, \u201cAlthough all political\nparties resorted to coordinated disinformation campaigns in these elections, the\nones targeted most are obviously the independent candidates backed by the PTI.\u201d\nFacter, which was launched a week before the polls took place, has been designed\nexclusively for Pakistani newsrooms to assist them in verifying news. Khalid\nsaid, \u201cWorking round the clock, our monitoring team at MMfD gathered a bulk of\nelectoral disinformation, which ranged from edited images to misleading videos,\nmany of which required rounds of reviews and verification.\u201d\n\nAbdul Moiz Malik, a sub-editor at the Dawn newspaper, said, \u201cThe only addition\nwas AI-generated images and content. Otherwise, there was the usual [scale of]\nmisinformation spread by political parties and their supporters.\u201d Muzhira Amin,\na senior journalist in the digital wing of Dawn, shared a similar opinion,\nremarking, \u201cCompared to the last election, there was less disinformation this\ntime. While there were several viral misleading news items, they were usually\nfact-checked on social media by users, which, I think, made our work a lot\neasier in dealing with a certain piece of information under question.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from my own experience at Facter, a number of misleading posts that\nemerged during polls were actively debunked by regular social media users, many\nof whom appeared to have developed basic digital investigation skills to counter\nmisinformation online.\n\nTIKTOK\u2019S INFLUENCE AND COUNTER-EFFORTS TO CONTAIN MISINFORMATION\n\nAsad Baig, a technology and media sustainability expert and director at MMfD,\nbelieves there has been a \u201cmassive\u201d difference between the elections held in\n2018 and 2024 in how misinformation was deployed.\n\n\u201cFirstly, political parties started investing heavily in social media platforms,\nand the culture of \u2018trolls farms\u2019 and \u2018social media teams\u2019 has become quite\nprevalent,\u201d Baig said. \u201cSecondly, TikTok has brought a number of new users\nonline and they now have a platform to express themselves. The flow of\ninformation or disinformation on TikTok is both abundant and very fast, due to\nwhich it has become a very political platform. Besides, misinformation in the\n2018 elections was not weaponised in the way we witnessed [later].\u201d\n\nBaig\u2019s remarks echo the findings published in a 2022 report by the advocacy\ngroup Integrity Institute. The report highlights how TikTok and Twitter (now X)\nare more likely to spread misinformation through their easy content-sharing\nfeatures. However, Baig adds that during the recent elections, he witnessed\nvarious \u201ccounter efforts\u201d to prevent the spread of disinformation.\n\u201cDisinformation has increased, but, at the same time, the efforts to counter it\nhave also scaled up. For example, leading news organisations, including Geo\nNews, SAMAA TV and other outlets such as Soch Fact Check and MMfD\u2019s Facter, have\nestablished fact-checking initiatives.\u201d\n\nDIMINISHING HOPE?\n\nThe events leading to the February 8 polls appear to have had a radical impact\non voters regarding what they think of elections in a \u201cdemocracy\u201d. Citing a\nsurvey by the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN), which claims that 48% of\nvoters cast their ballots in the February 8 polls, Taha Kehar, a Pakistan-based\nauthor and commentator, expressed concern over people\u2019s perception that voting\ndoes not make a difference. He said, \u201cThe growing disillusionment is an outcome\nof decades of dynastic politics, intense political engineering by the\nestablishment, and a lack of belief in democracy as a viable means of\nsafeguarding the will of the people.\u201d Kehar added, \u201cThe suspension of mobile\nnetworks and internet connectivity on polling day as well as delays and\nconfusion surrounding results are an ever-present sign of democratic\nbacksliding.\u201d\n\nAfter the elections, the citizens of Pakistan did not know who had formed the\ngovernment in the country for several weeks, when finally the two parties,\nPakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N),\nwhich did not win majority votes, formed an alliance, and consequently the\ngovernment. But my question is: if the people voted in defiance against the\nestablishment\u2019s strategic targeting of a certain political party \u2013 which did\nindeed yield unexpectedly impressive results \u2013 then what do we, as a collective\nforce of resistance against anti-democratic agents, have in store for us?\n\nImage:\u00a0CM Shehbaz with Pak Army by\u00a0Shehbaz Sharif via Flickr (CC BY 2.0 DEED)\n\nUsman Shahid is a Pakistan-based journalist working as project coordinator for\nthe Digital Rights & Internet Governance (DRIG) programme at Media Matters for\nDemocracy (MMfD).

The decision was reached\nin the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.\n\n\nTrading of the Fund on the NASDAQ will cease, and the Fund will no longer accept\ninvestor purchases after the close of regular trading on July 26, 2024 (the\n\u201cClosing Date\u201d). Shareholders have the option to sell their holdings in the Fund\nbefore the Closing Date, with standard brokerage fees applicable.\n\nShareholders may sell their holdings in the Fund prior to the Closing Date and\ncustomary brokerage charges may apply to these transactions. However, from July\n27, 2024 through July 31, 2024 (the \u201cLiquidation Date\u201d), shareholders may be\nable to sell their shares only to certain broker-dealers and there is no\nassurance that there will be a market for the Fund\u2019s shares during this time\nperiod. Between the Closing Date and the Liquidation Date, the Fund will be in\nthe process of closing down and liquidating the Fund\u2019s portfolio. This process\nwill result in the Fund increasing its cash holdings and, as a consequence, its\nportfolio holdings will be inconsistent with the Fund\u2019s investment objective and\nstrategy.\n\nOn or about the Liquidation Date, the Fund will liquidate its assets and\ndistribute cash pro rata to all shareholders of record who have not previously\nredeemed or sold their shares, subject to any required withholding. Liquidation\nproceeds paid to shareholders generally should be treated as received in\nexchange for shares and will therefore be treated as a taxable event giving rise\nto a capital gain or loss depending on a shareholder\u2019s tax basis. Shareholders\nshould contact their tax adviser to discuss the income tax consequences of the\nliquidation. In addition, these payments to shareholders may include\ndistributions of accrued capital gains and dividends. As calculated on the\nLiquidation Date, the Fund\u2019s net asset value will reflect the costs of closing\nthe Fund. Once the distributions are complete, the Fund will terminate.\n\nAbout Tidal Financial Group\n\nFormed by ETF industry pioneers and thought leaders, Tidal Financial Group sets\nout to revolutionize the way ETFs have historically been developed, launched,\nmarketed, and sold.

Virtual humans are just a device to communicate what those\nbroadcast journalist stories may be.\u201d\n\nScarpa predicts that virtual humans will become pervasive across all sorts of\nstorytelling genres. \u201cYou are seeing it in social media. You will see it in\nhealthcare and education, in other areas of entertainment, and broadcast\njournalism will not be immune,\u201d he says.\n\nPart of his argument for AI is simple cost efficiency: Local news in the US, as\nin other parts of the world such as the UK, has been challenged for some time in\nterms of operating costs. While local news remains an FCC mandate, its continued\nexistence is in contention because of changing business models.\n\nScarpa says he is a big believer in the value of local news broadcast as a\nstaple of information and culture, but the economics have to change.\n\n\u201cBroadcasters have to find new ways to monetize local news. They\u2019ve not veered\nfrom the same business model for the last half century. They have attempted to\nreduce costs in terms of basic infrastructure in studios and control rooms and\nnow there\u2019s shift in terms of talent from an on-camera presence to virtual\nhumans.\u201d\n\nMarc Scarpa, founder & CEO of DeFiance Media (left) and StoryTech\u2019s Lori H.\nSchwartz (right)\n\nThis could be to the benefit of already stretched on-air talent, suggests\nScarpa, since their likeness can be cloned into a digital representation of\nthem.\n\n\u201cThis would allow for the ability for known personalities to deliver more news\npackages without having to physically be there to shoot them and therefore\ngenerate more revenue for themselves. It would be a residual (royalty) module\nthat runs on a blockchain.\u201d\n\nScarpa is putting his theory into practice at DeFiance.tv, a television and\ndigital network reporting on the alternative economy \u2014 meaning Web3, AI, VR, and\ndigital asset developments.\n\n\nCREATING AND CASTING RAXANA\n\nDuring his fireside chat at NAB Show New York, Scarpa will share lessons learned\nin the course of creating Raxana. DeFiance originally worked with an\nout-of-the-box solution from Israeli developer Hour One but decided to customize\none for their purpose.\n\n\u201cHour One have fantastic technology, in particular for business-to-business\napplications, such as virtual humans for customer service, but it was not quite\nthe storytelling device we needed for news. We realized that we needed a virtual\nhuman who is representative of our brand and who could communicate well with our\naudience.\u201d\n\nInstead, DeFiance used Hour One\u2019s templates to create a bespoke virtual human\nbased on an existing news anchor already employed by the network.\n\n\u201cWhat is most important is you can go and start with a stock character which is\nsomething that we did, but ultimately, we chose to create our own. That was a\nhuge shift. Our engagement increased. The resonance with our brand really\nchanged,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is old saying, \u2018you have a face for radio,\u2019 which means something\nintangible about your ability to connect with listeners,\u201d Scarpa says. \u201cI\nbelieve there is something similar about people who have an on-camera presence.\nI am not sure of the science behind it, but some people are able to communicate\nbetter than others in front of a camera. That art can be replicated, starting by\nrecording motion capture of the person and delivering their virtual likeness on\nscreen.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cast Raxana \u2014 based on a real person \u2014 to represent this Eurasian human,\nwhich studies predict that most humans will have this similar genetic mix in\nfuture. In essence, Raxana is the most intelligent journalist that can read a\nteleprompter in the world, but she is not going to be doing Barbara Walters\ninterviews anytime soon.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cHow we use virtual humans is very rudimentary and basic at this\nstage. We are not using it to substitute for investigative journalism or a talk\nshow format. The tech is not there yet, but it will [be]. I have seen AI virtual\ncompanion software that is outstanding.\u201d\n\nHowever, DeFinance is using AI across the news production workflow, not just in\npresentation.\n\n\u201cWe use AI for fact checking and scripting and research and generation of video.\nWe\u2019re utilizing a variety of AI tech in our workflow to deliver factual accurate\nnews packages,\u201d Scarpa says.\n\n\nOTHER AI ANCHORS\n\nWhile the technology is cutting-edge, Scarpa is not the first to implement it.\n\nIn 2018, Chinese News agency Xinhua News unveiled an AI news anchor. A year\nlater, it launched a female AI news anchor, \u201cXin Xiaomeng,\u201d also developed by\nChinese tech firm Sogu, whose voice and image were clones of a reporter named Qu\nMeng, a news anchor at Xinhua\u2019s New Media Center.\n\nIn April this year, Kuwait News introduced \u201cFedha,\u201d an AI news anchor on\nTwitter, as a test of its potential to offer new content.\n\n\nTHE NEW FACE OF NEWS?\n\nWould an artificial news anchor weaken and destroy any faith we have left in\nbroadcast news as a source of trusted information?\n\nScarpa replies by arguing that Walter Cronkie was the most trusted face of news\nin history \u2014 but that there was still an organization of broadcast journalists\nbehind the camera.\n\n\u201cThere are different types of broadcasters. Some are investigative, some report\nsports or the weather. All the rest of the hosts on our platform are humans who\npresent traditional TV news shows, doing their own independent research and\ngiving their opinions,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cRaxana\u2019s function is very specific. She is not able to do much, but she is able\nto do enough for what we want her deliver and to able to package that news up at\nscale.\n\n\u201cFor example, we can create and broadcast a news bulletin every two hours and\ntake that package and auto-translate it into 30 languages. That\u2019s an economy of\nscale that only AI can achieve. At the same time, we\u2019re getting across\ninformation about the new economy out to as many people as possible. That is our\nfocus and that is why Raxana works for us.\u201d\n\nHowever, live broadcasts are not yet possible. Scarpa says, \u201cIf I have a live\ncamera covering the Senate hearings, then I would not feel comfortable having\nthat fed into an AI for real-time commentary as human anchors and journalists do\nwith authority today, but anything pre-taped can work in that manner.\u201d\n\nThat said, Scarpa imagines weather presentation to evolve to virtual humans\n\u201cfairly soon\u201d with some forms of sports commentary to follow \u2014 although, again,\nnot where there\u2019s any live interaction between a virtual sports presenter and an\nathlete, human news anchor or pundit.\n\n\u201cWe are not there yet with live. I\u2019ve seen it working and seen you can do it,\nbut it\u2019s not ready for primetime.\u201d",

Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at\nmarket price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund.\nBrokerage commissions will reduce returns.\n\nIndex Overview: The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of\nthe largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on\nmarket capitalization. This makes it a large-cap index, meaning its constituents\nhave a high market value, often in the billions of dollars. The Index includes\ncompanies from various industries but is heavily weighted towards the technology\nsector. This reflects the Nasdaq\u2019s historic strength as a listing venue for tech\ncompanies. Other sectors represented include consumer discretionary, health\ncare, communication services, and industrials, among others.\n\nIndirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund,\nthe Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved\nwith this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to\nreceive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the\ncompanies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the\nperformance of the Index. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that\nincludes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket, based on market capitalization. This makes it a large-cap index, meaning\nits constituents have a high market value, often in the billions of dollars.\n\nIndex Trading Risk. The trading price of the Index may be highly volatile and\ncould continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various\nfactors. \u00adThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of companies.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index Risks: The Index\u2019s major risks stem from its high\nconcentration in the technology sector and significant exposure to high-growth,\nhigh valuation companies. A downturn in the tech industry, whether from\nregulatory changes, shifts in technology, or competitive pressures, can greatly\nimpact the index. It\u2019s also vulnerable to geopolitical risks due to many\nconstituent companies having substantial international operations. Since many of\nthese tech companies often trade at high valuations, a shift in investor\nsentiment could lead to significant price declines.\n\nDerivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from\nthe underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds\n(including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund's investments in\nderivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated\nwith directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including\nrisk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments,\nhigher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity,\nvaluation and legal restrictions.\n\nPrice Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes\nthe sale of in-the-money put option contracts, which limits the degree to which\nthe Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the Index over\nthe Call Period (typically, one day, but may range up to one week). This means\nthat if the Index experiences an increase in value above the strike price of the\nsold put options during a Call Period, the Fund will likely not experience that\nincrease to the same extent and may significantly underperform the Index over\nthe Call Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to\nwhich it will participate in increases in value experienced by the Index over\neach Call Period, but has full exposure to any decreases in value experienced by\nthe Index over the Call Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given\ntime period.\n\nDistribution Risk. As part of the Fund's investment objective, the Fund seeks to\nprovide current monthly income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a\ndistribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the\namounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to\nthe next.\n\nNew Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company\nwith no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a\ntrack record or history on which to base their investment decisions.\n\nHigh Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or\na significant portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate\nincreases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund\u2019s expenses.\n\nLiquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts,\nmay be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market\nturmoil. This risks greater for the Fund as it will hold options contracts on a\nsingle security, and not a broader range of options contracts.\n\nDisclosures: Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor.

The fund is an actively managed ETF that seeks to\nprovide monthly income with exposure to zero-day options on the Nasdaq, as well\nas fixed income from 6month to two-year Treasures.\n\n\n\nThe fund seeks to generate income via the selling of at-the-money (ATM) and/or\nin the money (ITM) short-put options in the Nasdaq index with a daily benchmark\nof 0.25% return. The options sold can be variable, from ATM options up to 5%\nITM. The fund will typically use one-DTE options but can extend up to one week\nout in time based on the day of the sale.\n\nTrading ATM, and slightly ITM options provides the potential to capture both\nintrinsic value gains from the increase in the index price, as well as extrinsic\nvalue in the form of the premium sold via the options. It\u2019s important to note\nthat intrinsic gains will be capped via the options, much like a covered call,\nso the potential upside tail exposure is limited.\n\nThe fund will also keep a sizable portion of the funds in short-term Treasures,\nranging in 6-month to two-year maturities. Up to 80% of the fund will be\nallocated to cash or Treasures as fixed income and usually will be held until\nmaturity.\n\nQQQY will distribute the income generated from the fund monthly.\n\n\nWHY IS QQQY IMPORTANT AND WHO WILL TRADE IT?\n\nQQQY is an interesting new investment opportunity for those looking to get\nexposure to short term option trades via a cheap underlying ETF. This product\ncan be used in smaller sized accounts or IRA accounts looking for potential\npassive income. This of course, isn\u2019t a paycheck trade\u2014the ETF will still have\nexposure to adverse markets, changes in interest rates, and has a sizable 0.99%\nmanagement fee.\n\nGiven that most of the fund is allocated to Treasuries, the fund has the\npotential to underperform when the Nasdaq goes up significantly \u2013 but\npotentially outperform the market if it were to go down relative to the index\nitself.\n\nThe fund will be most profitable with a sideways up move in the market daily\ndepending on which options are sold for that expiration. Because of the limited\noption exposure, the fund will likely underperform the comparable option\nposition from a notional value perspective \u2013 as the Treasure yield on a daily\nbasis is likely to be far less than the potential extrinsic value of both ATM\noptions as well as the potentially 5% ITM option, and the drag of the 0.99%\nmanagement fees.\n\nYou can read the summary prospectus HERE.\n\nWhat do you think about this new ETF?

Net income slid 9 percent, reflecting\nramped-up spending on content, but still exceeded expectations at 36.2 billion\nyuan. Shares in Prosus NV, a proxy for Tencent as its largest shareholder,\nclimbed more than 4.8 percent in Amsterdam.\n\nThe results may help assuage concerns that the world\u2019s largest internet arena\nhas lost steam after years of regulatory and economic turmoil. They reinforce\nviews that lower-cost and leisure spending remains resilient despite pullbacks\nin a plethora of segments from luxury to overseas travel. Investors worry that\nthe Chinese economy is in danger of entering a deflationary spiral, a fear\nreinforced by lackluster spending on e-commerce platforms during this year\u2019s\nSingles\u2019 Day shopping festival.\n\nChinese consumption remains muted thanks to a plethora of headwinds from a\ncrumbling property market to rising youth unemployment. Deflationary pressure\nworsened in October, fuelling expectations the world\u2019s No. 2 economy needs more\nstimulus to shore up growth.\n\nBut Tencent hopes its mainstay businesses from gaming to payments are less\nvulnerable to the downturn as consumers keep spending on low-ticket items.\nMonetisation by summer hits including Valorant and Lost Ark is expected to fully\nkick in during the remainder of this year, while the world\u2019s biggest games\npublisher expands Honor of Kings \u2013 its most lucrative intellectual property \u2013\ninto more genres.\n\nOnline advertising, typically closely associated with the economic climate, was\nTencent\u2019s fastest-growing division with a 20 percent gain in revenue. That was\ndriven in part by growing user engagement in video, where total views climbed 50\npercent during the quarter.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. and NetEase Inc. will report earnings Thursday in\nanother set of signals on how e-commerce and gaming fared during the\npost-pandemic reopening.\n\nLonger run, Tencent joins much of the Chinese tech sector in exploring the\npotential of generative AI. Its in-house large language model, Hunyuan, is now\nintegrated with more than 180 services including search and online marketing.\nTogether with arch-foe Alibaba, the Shenzhen-based company also made multiple\nbets on domestic AI upstarts in the so-called \u201cwar of a hundred models,\u201d helping\nmint new unicorns like Baichuan.\n\nStill, WeChat for now is a more dependable growth driver before any AI foray\ncomes to fruition. China\u2019s go-to super app is credited with engineering a\nturnaround in ad sales, after its short video feed lured users and marketers\nback from ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Douyin. But TikTok\u2019s Chinese twin, meanwhile, is\nrapidly encroaching on WeChat\u2019s territory, adding real-world services like\ne-commerce and food delivery.\n\nShares of Tencent have plunged roughly 25 percent since its January high,\ntrailing the Hang Seng Tech Index. That\u2019s despite the Chinese firm returning\nabout $24 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends this year.\nTencent\u2019s largest shareholder Prosus remains an overhang, as the Dutch\ninvestment arm of Naspers Ltd. has been gradually offloading its Tencent stake\nto fund its own buybacks.\n\nBy Zheping Huang\n\nLearn more:\n\nReports: China Readies Big Tencent Fine in Crackdown\n\nChina is preparing to slap a fine on Tencent Holdings Ltd. as part of its\nantitrust crackdown on the country\u2019s internet giants, Reuters said, citing\npeople with knowledge of the matter.",

The firm's actively managed options\nETFs are designed to potentially enhance income for investors, with\ndistributions paid on a monthly basis 1\n\nThe performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance\ndoes not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of\nan investment will fluctuate so that an investor\u2019s shares, when sold or\nredeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current\nperformance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above.\nPerformance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling\n833.333.9383.\n\n1 The funds intend to pay distributions, if any, on a monthly basis.\n\nAs of 10-31-23 the 30-Day SEC yield** for QQQY is 3.41% JEPY is 3.10% and IWMY\nis N/A.\n\nThe Gross Expense Ratio for QQQY, JEPY, and IWMY is 0.99%\n\nClick here for the QQQY Prospectus.\nClick here for the JEPY Prospectus.\nClick here for the IWMY Prospectus.\n\n* The Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the\nmost recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the\nsame going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying an ETF\u2019s\nDistribution per Share by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the\nETF\u2019s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution\nfrom the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions are not\nguaranteed.\n\n** The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield is not indicative of future\ndistributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any\nETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You\nare not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if\nany) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be\nzero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over\ntime, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a\ncombination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital,\nwhich may decrease a fund's NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an\ninvestor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These distribution\nrates caused by unusually favorable market conditions may not be sustainable.\nSuch conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation\nthat this performance may be repeated in the future. Additional fund risks can\nbe found below.\n\n\u201cInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and\nexpenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with\nthis and other information about the Fund, please call 833.333.9383. Read the\nprospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.\u201d\n\nInvesting involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at\nmarket price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund.\nBrokerage commissions will reduce returns.\n\nThe Distribution Rate is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most\nrecently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same\ngoing forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by multiplying an ETF\u2019s\nDistribution per Share by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the\nETF\u2019s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution\nfrom the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions are not\nguaranteed.\n\nAn Investment in the Funds is not an investment in the Index, nor are the Funds\nan investment in a traditional passively managed index fund.\n\nQQQY Index Overview: The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100\nof the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based\non market capitalization. This makes it a large-cap index, meaning its\nconstituents have a high market value, often in the billions of dollars. The\nIndex includes companies from various industries but is heavily weighted towards\nthe technology sector. This reflects the Nasdaq\u2019s historic strength as a listing\nvenue for tech companies. Other sectors represented include consumer\ndiscretionary, health care, communication services, and industrials, among\nothers.\n\nJEPY Index Overview: The S&P 500 Index is a widely recognized benchmark index\nthat tracks the performance of 500 of the largest U.S.-based companies listed on\nthe New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. These companies represent approximately\n80% of the total U.S. equities market by capitalization, making it a large-cap\nindex.\n\nIWMY Index Overview: The Russell 2000 Index is a widely recognized benchmark\nindex that tracks the performance of approximately 2000 small-cap companies in\nthe United States. These are the smallest companies listed in the Russell 3000\nIndex, representing about 10% of that index\u2019s total market capitalization.\n\nQQQY Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the\nFund, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not\ninvolved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the\nright to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with\nrespect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines\nin the performance of the Index.

Investors in the Fund will not have the\nright to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with\nrespect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines\nin the performance of the Index.\n\nIndex Trading Risk. The trading price of the Index may be highly volatile and\ncould continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various\nfactors. \u00adThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of companies.\n\nS&P 500 Index Risks: The Index, which includes a broad swath of large U.S.\ncompanies, is primarily exposed to overall economic and market conditions.\nRecession, inflation, and changes in interest rates can significantly impact the\nindex\u2019s performance. Furthermore, despite its diverse representation, a downturn\nin a major sector such as technology or financials could notably affect the\nindex. Geopolitical risks and unexpected global events, like pandemics, can\nintroduce volatility and uncertainty.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index Risks: The Index\u2019s major risks stem from its high\nconcentration in the technology sector and significant exposure to high-growth,\nhigh valuation companies. A downturn in the tech industry, whether from\nregulatory changes, shifts in technology, or competitive pressures, can greatly\nimpact the index. It\u2019s also vulnerable to geopolitical risks due to many\nconstituent companies having substantial international operations. Since many of\nthese tech companies often trade at high valuations, a shift in investor\nsentiment could lead to significant price declines.\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index Risks: The Index, which includes a broad swath of large\nU.S. companies, is primarily exposed to overall economic and market conditions.\nRecession, inflation, and changes in interest rates can significantly impact the\nindex\u2019s performance. Furthermore, despite its diverse representation, a downturn\nin a major sector such as technology or financials could notably affect the\nindex. Geopolitical risks and unexpected global events, like pandemics, can\nintroduce volatility and uncertainty.\n\nDerivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from\nthe underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds\n(including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund's investments in\nderivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated\nwith directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including\nrisk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments,\nhigher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity,\nvaluation and legal restrictions.\n\nPrice Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes\nthe sale of in-the-money put option contracts, which limits the degree to which\nthe Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the Index over\nthe Call Period (typically, one day, but may range up to one week). This means\nthat if the Index experiences an increase in value above the strike price of the\nsold put options during a Call Period, the Fund will likely not experience that\nincrease to the same extent and may significantly underperform the Index over\nthe Call Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to\nwhich it will participate in increases in value experienced by the Index over\neach Call Period, but has full exposure to any decreases in value experienced by\nthe Index over the Call Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given\ntime period.\n\nDistribution Risk. As part of the Fund's investment objective, the Fund seeks to\nprovide current monthly income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a\ndistribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the\namounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to\nthe next.\n\nNew Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company\nwith no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a\ntrack record or history on which to base their investment decisions.\n\nHigh Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or\na significant portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate\nincreases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund\u2019s expenses.\n\nLiquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts,\nmay be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market\nturmoil. This risks greater for the Fund as it will hold options contracts on a\nsingle security, and not a broader range of options contracts.\n\nDisclosures: Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor.

The President\u2019s critics say he has made an\nabout-turn on the pledges.\n\nDr Ruto has become the lord of taxes, earning the moniker \u201cZakayo\u201d (Zacchaeus),\nin reference to the Biblical tax collector, who climbed a tree to have a glimpse\nof Jesus Christ.\n\nReaction to proposals in the Finance Bill, 2024 have reignited debate on tax.\nOpposition Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition has told the President to \u201cclimb\ndown\u201d, but Dr Ruto appears to have no apologies for introducing taxes every\nyear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind being called names.

I want to leave\nit at 20 or 22 per cent over my term. It is going to be difficult and I have a\nlot of explaining to do. People will complain but I know they will appreciate\nit,\u201d he told Harvard Business School students.\n\n\u201cKenyans have been socialised to believe that they pay the highest taxes in the\nworld but data show that as of last year, our tax as a percentage of GDP was 14.\nOur peers on the continent are at 22 to 25 per cent. Countries like France are\nat 45 per cent, others are higher.\u201d\n\nBut Prof XN Iraki \u2013 an economics lecturer at the University of Nairobi \u2013 says\nKenyans are actually being overtaxed if levies and taxes are factored into the\nequation. He raises queries on how the taxes are eventually used.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is what we do with that tax, not the ratio. A higher ratio is not\na guarantee that tax will be prudently used. It could mean shifting money from\nthe productive private sector to public,\u201d Prof Iraki said.\n\n\u201cWe should focus on growing GDP as that will mean more money to pay more taxes.\nOne wishes the ratio goes up because we have more money and our tax rate has\ngone up.\n\n\"Tax is progressive. Higher tax to GDP ratio would lessen the debt burden if we\nreduce borrowing and raise enough tax revenues without slowing down the economic\ngrowth. We still have a deficit despite higher and more taxes.\u201d\n\nMr Ken Gichinga, Chief Economist at Mentoria Economics, says the Kenya Kwanza\nadministration is focused on taxing consumption, describing it as regressive. He\nsays the approach by Dr Ruto has a potential of slowing economic growth, with\nthe government not meeting revenue targets.\n\n\u201cIf we have progressive tax system, Kenya will raise enough revenue without\ndisrupting the economy.\n\n\"But if we have a regressive policy, we might not hit the revenue targets. It\ncould actually cause a slowdown of the economy and increase the cost of living,\u201d\nsaid Mr Gichinga, adding that many companies may close shop.\n\nRegressive tax policy is consumption taxes of everyday goods.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on a progressive tax policy. When you get a promotion and earn\na higher salary, for instance, the government will collect more revenue and it\ndoes not disrupt the worker. Focus in the developed world is creating jobs,\u201d Mr\nGichinga said.\n\n\u201cOnce more people have income, it becomes easy to collect tax. In Kenya,\nunfortunately, we start with tax. It has made it very difficult for companies to\noperate.\u201d\n\nIn analysing the Finance Bill, 2024, audit firm KPMG highlights the implications\nof the new taxes. It says they are likely to make life expensive.\n\nThe company says the introduction of the annual 2.5 per cent tax on cars was due\nto the increasing number of vehicles on Kenyan roads.\n\n\u201cIt comes against the backdrop of revised insurance premium rates and high fuel\nprices, inevitably shoring up the cost of operating a car. This will have a\nnegative impact on transport and logistics, which may pass the additional cost\nto customers and thus escalate the cost of living,\u201d KPMG said.\n\nOn the proposed VAT on bread from zero, it says the price of the basic food item\nwill shoot up.\n\n\u201cThe proposal to change the VAT status of bread has found its way into previous\nFinance Bills. We hope the proposal will again be dropped when the Act is\nenacted,\u201d says the document by the company.\n\nThe Kenya Bankers Association has appealed to the National Assembly to\nreconsider the proposed 16 per cent VAT on transactions, saying it would hamper\nfinancial inclusion, particularly affecting low income earners and small\nbusinesses.\n\n\u201cCoupled with excise duty, the total tax on financial services would reach 40\nper cent from the current 15, significantly impacting affordability and\naccessibility,\u201d the association said.\n\nIt expressed surprise at the bill seeking to introduce VAT on financial\nservices, including issuing credit and debit cards, telegraphic money transfer,\nforeign exchange and cheque handling.\n\nThe Associated Battery Manufacturers raised concerns over the proposed tax of\nSh750 per kilo of battery weight.\n\nGuy Jack, the Group CEO, says a lead acid battery weighing 12 kilos and\nretailing at Sh8,500 will go for Sh17,500 once the proposal is implemented.\n\n\u201cThis is unsustainable and will result in the destruction of the industry,\u201d Mr\nGuy said.\n\nNational Assembly Minority Leader, Opiyo Wandayi, said Azimio would oppose the\ntaxes, describing them as punitive and with a potential of hurting poor\nhouseholds.\n\n\u201cThe taxes are unjustifiable. The tax base will shrink as many people will find\nways of dodging taxes,\u201d the Ugunja MP said.\n\n\u201cThe government should have focused on spurring economic growth by supporting\nproduction, which would then enhance disposable income. The common man will\nsuffer because the taxes will still end up in the pockets of few individuals,\u201d\nhe said.\n\nThere is a general feeling among Kenyans that taxes are being squandered by the\npolitical elite.\n\n\n * BREAD, M-PESA, ALCOHOL HIT IN NEW SH323BN RUTO TAX PLAN\n   \n   Government eyes an additional Sh323 billion in taxes in the coming financial\n   year.\n\n\n * PREMIUM TREASURY HITS BREAD WITH VAT\n   \n   The price of a 400g loaf will rise by upwards of Sh10.\n\n\n * PREMIUM AIRTIME, MOBILE MONEY TRANSFER CHARGES TO RISE IN PROPOSED NEW TAXES\n   \n   The excise on mobile airtime, data charges has also been raised to 20pc in\n   the new Finance Bill.\n\n\n * PREMIUM VODKA, WHISKY PRICES TO GO UP ON HIGHER LEVIES\n   \n   The Finance Bill 2024 proposes a new method of calculating excise on beer.\n\n\n * PREMIUM VEHICLE OWNERS TO PAY ANNUAL TAX OF UP TO SH100,000\n   \n   The Bill introduces 2.5 per cent annual tax on the value of vehicles, set at\n   a minimum of Sh5,000.",

        "content": "By Kavita Chandran\n\n\u201cOne has to bring in logical thinking while being passionate,\u201d said Koreel\nLahiri, Director of Media Development Investment Fund (South Asia). Lahiri has\nmore than 15 years of experience in media investing and has served in senior\ninvestment, strategy and operational roles in various large Indian media\norganisations.\n\n\u201cHow do you extend your business? Who is your audience? Is your content\nsomething people will pay for? You need to keep asking these questions and\nchallenging assumptions using data,\u201d Lahiri\u00a0 said during a virtual panel\ndiscussion at the Asian Media Leaders Summit hosted by WAN-IFRA and the Google\nNews Initiative. \u201cAre you barking up the wrong tree as a business model?\u201d\n\nBhanupriya Rao, the founder of BehanBox, a media startup in India that reports\non issues around women and gender diversity, reiterated the importance of news\nentrepreneurs being product thinkers.\n\n\u201cHow do you convert what you think is an existing gap in news coverage \u2026 and how\ndo you convince funders and investors that there is an audience for it? That\nneeds a fundamental change within your own mindset and within your own operation\ninto thinking about your journalism as a product,\u201d said Rao at the online\nsummit.\n\n\nDESPITE CHALLENGES, STARTUPS KEEP POPPING UP\n\nEven as conventional media outlets struggle to survive in an era of social media\nadvertising, influencer revenue and savvy digital marketing, defiant media\nstartups keep popping up around the world on the belief that people will always\nwant news. Some even have news automation algorithms powered by Blockchain and\nArtificial Intelligence.\n\nYet, media startups are finding it hard to raise capital as funding declines.\nNot only do they have to be prepared for shrinking ad revenue but also combat\nfake news, misinformation and disinformation, and grow a clientele that\u2019s\ngetting increasingly fatigued with negative news.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the 2021 Digital News report by the Reuters Institute, just 25% of\nnews consumers prefer to start their news journeys with a website or app. Those\naged 18\u201324, also referred to as Generation Z, have an even weaker connection\nwith websites and apps and are almost twice as likely to prefer to access news\nvia social media, aggregators, or mobile alerts.\n\nSo, the key questions are: how well are news startups working on their\nstorytelling technique and design to target future news consumers who believe in\nauthenticity and impact, have shorter attention spans and use social media as\ntheir news source?\n\n\u201cWhen we started looking at our audience using our data, we realised that we are\nlooking at an audience of 18-25,\u201d said Rao, who had initially pegged her\naudience as urban women over 25 years of age who enjoy in-depth long-form\nstories.\n\n\u201cWhat we understood is that our audience was not only looking at us for\ninformation, they were wanting to do something actionable with it \u2013 either\nhaving difficult conversations with their families, or in this highly polarised\nenvironment, making the change themselves,\u201d Rao said.\n\n\n\n\n\u2018A PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH\u2019\n\nSmall news organisations are also getting support from programmes such as the\nGoogle News Initiative (GNI) that run labs to help journalism startups better\nunderstand their audiences, create higher quality content and navigate the\npitfalls of monetisation. Rao\u2019s BehanBox is one such startup that has received\nGNI support.\n\n\u201cGNI\u2019s design thinking approach for media startups is a problem-solving approach\naimed at helping business growth through coaching, mentoring and product\ndevelopment,\u201d said Filip Shen, the APAC News Startups and Programs Lead for\nGoogle and a panellist on the WAN-IFRA forum.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThrough design thinking, we have been able to find new audiences, understand\nwhat they want, and also look at different products that can bring us more\nsustainable revenues,\u201d Rao said. \u201cThe biggest revelation was the audience told\nus they wanted to pay for our product.\u201d\n\nBeing creative in your offering, having a strong ecosystem and finding a niche\nthat differentiates you as a news startup is crucial, especially at a time when\nconsumers can find innumerable ways to access general news in multiple outlets,\nfree of cost.\n\n\u201cHow do you change your game while staying in the non-entertainment factual\nspace is where the answer lies,\u201d said Lahiri.\n\nAbout the writer: Kavita Chandran is a journalism trainer, author, and professor\nof journalism & communications at Murdoch University, and runs a media startup\nin Singapore.

The ban\non the flag was lifted in 1993 after the signing of the Oslo Peace Accords.\n\n\"A flag symbolises that you are a distinct group of people, that you are a\nnation,\" Martin Kear, a lecturer in international relations at the University of\nSydney, told SBS News.\n\n\"That is something that the Israelis worked hard to prevent, even from 1948\nonwards, that there was any sense of some group of people that would be known as\nPalestinians.\"\n\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators holding an inflatable watermelon at a protest in\nLondon on 11 November.

You can demonise the keffiyeh. It's\npretty difficult to demonise the watermelon, and you can still get your message\nout.\"\n\nWatermelons resurged in January when Israel's national security minister Itamar\nBen-Gvir ordered the police commander to authorise officers to remove\nPalestinian flags flying in public spaces.\n\nAlthough it is not illegal to fly the Palestinian flag, Israeli laws prohibit\nthe public display of a flag of an enemy country or group hostile to Israel's\nexistence.\n\nFollowing this, Zazim, an Israeli \"campaign community\" of \"citizens, Arabs and\nJews\" aimed at \"combatting the occupation\" launched a campaign against the\nproposals with a picture of a watermelon captioned, \"This is not a Palestinian\nflag\".\n\nPalestine is not universally recognised as an independent state, but for the\npast 11 years has been accepted as a non-member observer in the United Nations,\nwhich considers its territory to be occupied by Israel.\n\nA UN commission of inquiry found in 2022 the Israeli occupation of Palestinian\nterritory was unlawful. Then Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid described the\nreport as biased and false.\n\nA Hamas-led attack on Israel took place on 7 October in which more than 1,200\npeople were killed, including an estimated 30 children, and over 240 hostages\ntaken, according to the Israeli government. It was the latest flashpoint in\ndecades-long\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nSince then, more than 15,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including nearly\n6,000 children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled\nenclave.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WATERMELON SEEDS\n\n\n\nPalestinian artist and activist Aseel Tayah was among those attending a protest\nagainst the war in Melbourne that featured a large watermelon flag.\n\nShe said the seeds have symbolism as they represent the children and the future\nof the occupied territory.\n\n\"The seeds mean the children, the seeds mean the future, those that we plant and\nwait until they grow,\" Tayah said.\n\n\"And become something powerful to get the land back. Our land was taken from our\ngrandparents and the grandchildren are the ones who are going to bring [it back]\nand fight for the rights of Palestinians.\"\n\n\nMelbourne-based artist Aseel Tayah advocates for human rights through her\nartwork. Source: SBS News\n\nShe said art was a powerful way to communicate with those who don't attend\nprotests. She hopes they will ask for the meaning behind the watermelon.\n\n\"It's just kind of a symbol of love and freedom, a symbol of surviving and\nresistance, as symbol of we have not forgotten and we are here to keep telling\nthe stories,\" she said.",

What they need is\ncharacter, resilience and fight. What they need are the qualities Sean Dyche has\ningrained in Everton.\n\n\"It is 23 days since Everton were docked 10 points for a breach of Premier\nLeague profit and sustainability rules. They have clawed back nine points\nalready with a hat-trick of league wins \u2013 the club\u2019s first since the days of\nCarlo Ancelotti in March 2021 \u2013 with Chelsea the latest to succumb to Dyche\u2019s\ndefiant team. The expensively assembled visitors dominated possession at\nGoodison Park but were again found wanting not merely in front of goal but in\nterms of character.\n\n\"Everton showed it in abundance with an outstanding defensive display, the\nlatest goal from Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and the substitute Lewis Dobbin\u2019s first for\nthe club delivering a merited victory. Dyche\u2019s team would be 10th, four points\nabove Chelsea, but for the deduction that is now under appeal. In the meantime,\nas their manager would say, they simply crack on.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\"Perhaps Everton should start every season with a 10-point deduction\"\n\nIan Whitwell for the Telegraph wrote: \"Perhaps Everton should start every season\nwith a 10-point deduction from the Premier League, judging by the way that\npunishment has galvanised Sean Dyche\u2019s club in the wake of this latest, hugely\nimpressive win.\n\n\"The Everton faithful are currently backing their team in way that has made the\nmemories of protests against club ownership in recent seasons a thing the past -\nfor now, at least.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\"As for matters on the field, the first match post-deduction saw Everton soundly\nbeaten by Manchester United but successive victories in the first 10 days of\nDecember over Nottingham Forest, Newcastle and, now, Chelsea - all without\nconceding a goal - have lifted them well out of the relegation zone.\n\n\"Indeed, add the 10 points back on and not only would Everton be sitting\ncomfortably in the top half of the table, four points above Chelsea, but a place\nin the lesser European competitions would be well within their grasp.\n\n\"Goals from Abdoulaye Doucoure and Lewis Dobbin, with his first for the club,\nsecured this latest victory and rewarded the Evertonians who had festooned the\nGwladys Street End with banners protesting against the Premier League before\nkick-off.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\"Out of adversity has come strength, despair has given way to defiance\"\n\nPaul Joyce for the Times wrote: \"As Goodison Park cried itself hoarse in the\nclosing stages, a booming rendition of \u201cWe Shall Not Be Moved\u201d echoed around\nthis famous ground followed by the more caustic chant of \u201cYou can stick your\npoints deduction up your arse\u201d.\n\n\"Out of adversity has come strength, despair has given way to defiance, and\nwhere it can take Everton is now an alluring thought.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\"Without their ten-point deduction for a breach of Premier League spending\nrules, they would have gone into this contest ahead of Chelsea in the table. As\nit is, they are only six points behind Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s disjointed team\nafter a third successive victory in the space of eight days left the mood\nbuoyant.\n\n\"Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 punished the visitors for their wastefulness in the final\nthird and then youngster Lewis Dobbin thrashed home a shot in added time to\nmaintain the momentum garnered from wins over Nottingham Forest and Newcastle\nUnited.\n\n\"Doucour\u00e9, more than any other player, embodies the transformation that manager\nSean Dyche is overseeing. He had been ostracised by former manager Frank\nLampard, but from Dyche\u2019s first game in charge, the win over Arsenal, he has\nplayed a crucial role.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\"That highlights Dyche\u2019s ability to improve players and there is growing\nevidence of that elsewhere in Everton\u2019s ranks. Vitaliy Mykolenko was impressive\nat left back and alongside him Jarrad Branthwaite excelled in front of the\nwatching England coach Gareth Southgate.\"\n\n\"The youngster ignored his tired leds\"\n\nJoe Thomas for the ECHO wrote: \"In the fourth minute of stoppage time Everton\nhad already clinched a win over Chelsea but Jarrad Branthwaite was celebrating\nfor a different reason.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\"Lewis Dobbin had just doubled the Blues\u2019 lead with his first Premier League\ngoal and almost 40,000 home fans were partying in the stands. The players could\nhave been forgiven for joining them. Perhaps sensing the chance for personal\nglory, Conor Gallagher surged through on goal before being brought down in a\ncrashing heap by a sliding Branthwaite.\n\n\"The youngster ignored his tired legs and leapt up to be congratulated by his\nteammates for preserving a third clean sheet in a week.\n\n\"In the directors\u2019 box, next to director of football Kevin Thelwell, Gareth\nSouthgate had been looking on. He could have been in Liverpool to watch any one\nof a number of England internationals. The one that should have caught his\nattention was the player he has not yet called up.

        "content": "Rishi Sunak is to press ahead with plans to cut National Insurance for workers\ndespite warnings from the International Monetary Fund that the country needs\nhigher taxes.\n\nThe IMF warned that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s current plans for public spending\nwere not credible and would leave Britain\u2019s debt mountain on an ever-rising\npath.\n\nThe Fund said the next government will be forced to raise taxes or cut spending\nby an estimated \u00a330bn as the economy reels from the worklessness crisis.\n\nIt said: \u201cAs a general principle, staff would advise against additional tax\ncuts, unless they are credibly growth-enhancing and appropriately offset by\nhigh-quality deficit-reducing measures.\n\n\u201cStaff would have recommended against the National Insurance rate cuts, given\ntheir significant cost\u201d of \u00a310bn a year.\n\nHowever, the Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman said Downing Street\u00a0\u201crespectfully\ndisagree with the IMF\u201d and believe that \u201ccutting National Insurance, rewarding\nwork, is an important part of growing the economy.\u201d\n\nKristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, conceded that there is a case\nto be made that tax cuts for workers can boost growth.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Chancellor and his team are of the view that actions that\nincrease labour supply are necessary to deliver the growth outlook that is more\npositive...\u00a0We respect that view.\u201d\n\nHowever, the IMF recommended raising taxes and cutting spending to repair the\ncountry\u2019s battered finances.\n\nThe Fund suggested increasing inheritance tax and introducing a levy on electric\ncars to replace lost fuel duty, as well as calling for the pensions triple lock\nto be scrapped.\n\nIn its latest assessment of the economy, the Washington-based organisation\nupgraded its UK growth forecast from 0.5pc to 0.7pc this year as it called time\non an era of high inflation. Ms Georgieva hailed this as \u201cgood news\u201d for\nBritain.\n\nChancellor Hunt said the IMF\u2019s report showed pessimism about the economy was\n\u201cunjustified\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday\u2019s report clearly shows that independent international economists\nagree that the UK economy has turned a corner and is on course for a soft\nlanding.\n\n\u201cThe IMF have upgraded our growth for this year and forecast we will grow faster\nthan any other large European country over the next six years \u2013 so it is time to\nshake off some of the unjustified pessimism about our prospects.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the short-term growth upgrade,\u00a0the Fund warned that the UK\u2019s\nlonger-term prospects remained \u201csubdued due to weak productivity and somewhat\nhigher than expected inactivity levels due to long-term illness\u201d.\n\nAround 2.8 million people of working age are not in the workforce due to ill\nhealth, including mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. This\nis up from around two million before the 2020 lockdown.\n\nThere are 9.4 million people of working age overall who are neither in work nor\nlooking for a job in the UK, a decade-high.\n\nAli Abbas, the IMF\u2019s mission chief in the UK, said the increase in health\nproblems was a critical problem, with the pandemic\u2019s impact on mental health a\nparticularly acute issue.\n\nThe Fund\u00a0backed the government\u2019s plans to \u201ccontain\u201d Britain\u2019s soaring welfare\nbill, adding that those \u201ccapable of work\u201d should be \u201cincentivised to do so\u201d.\n\nIts\u00a0report suggested that future governments would need to start charging for\nmore public services, opening the door for the end of the NHS being free at the\npoint of use.\n\nThe\u00a0Fund said: \u201cDifficult choices will need to be made over the medium term to\nstabilise public debt, given significant pressures on public services and\ncritical investment needs.\u201d\n\nThe IMF did not specify any public services that the UK could start charging\nfor.\n\nMr Sunak raised the prospect of charging people in England \u00a310 if they miss GP\nor hospital appointments when he was running to become Tory leader. He scrapped\nthe pledge after medics warned it would threaten the NHS\u2019s fundamental principle\nof being free at the point of use.\n\nMs Georgieva said it was vital for the UK to bring debt under control after\nyears of heavy borrowing.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are genuinely concerned, not just with the UK, for all countries\nthat have used fiscal buffers extensively. They must do more to rebuild these\nbuffers.\n\n\u201cIn a world of more uncertainty, we do not know when there may be again a call\non governments to have to borrow more to spend more.\n\n\u201cWe had a prolonged period of very low interest rates. Governments, companies,\nhouseholds, borrowed. They accumulated debt with low interest rates, [which was]\nvery bearable \u2013 until it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe IMF also urged the Bank of England not to wait too long to cut interest\nrates, warning that \u201cdelayed easing\u201d could \u201cstall or even reverse the recovery\u201d,\nundermining Threadneedle Street\u2019s ability to keep inflation at its 2pc target.\n\nThe Fund called for three cuts by the end of this year, taking the base rate\nfrom 5.25pc to 4.5pc. It expects interest rates to stand at around 3.5pc by the\nend of next year, which it said would help to boost economic growth in 2025 to\n1.5pc.",

        "content": "There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable\nbusinesses. For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com\nlost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since\n2005, you'd have done very well indeed. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore\nthe risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.\n\nSo, the natural question for Defiance Silver () shareholders is whether they\nshould be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this article, we define cash\nburn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a\ncompany spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of\nthe business' cash, relative to its cash burn.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Defiance Silver\n\n\nWHEN MIGHT DEFIANCE SILVER RUN OUT OF MONEY?\n\nA company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash\nburn. As at March 2023, Defiance Silver had cash of CA$6.4m and no debt. Looking\nat the last year, the company burnt through CA$9.3m. Therefore, from March 2023\nit had roughly 8 months of cash runway. To be frank, this kind of short runway\nputs us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn\nsignificantly, or else raise cash imminently. You can see how its cash balance\nhas changed over time in the image below.\n\n\n\n\nHOW IS DEFIANCE SILVER'S CASH BURN CHANGING OVER TIME?\n\nBecause Defiance Silver isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an\nearly-stage business. Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory\nas part of our assessment of its cash burn situation. It's possible that the\n6.3% reduction in cash burn over the last year is evidence of management\ntightening their belts as cash reserves deplete. Defiance Silver makes us a\nlittle nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most\nof the stocks on .\n\n\nHOW EASILY CAN DEFIANCE SILVER RAISE CASH?\n\nWhile Defiance Silver is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still\nworth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster\ngrowth. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Many\ncompanies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By looking at a\ncompany's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on\nhow much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough\ncash to cover another year's cash burn.\n\nSince it has a market capitalisation of CA$32m, Defiance Silver's CA$9.3m in\ncash burn equates to about 29% of its market value. That's fairly notable cash\nburn, so if the company had to sell shares to cover the cost of another year's\noperations, shareholders would suffer some costly dilution.\n\n\nSO, SHOULD WE WORRY ABOUT DEFIANCE SILVER'S CASH BURN?\n\nOn this analysis of Defiance Silver's cash burn, we think its cash burn\nreduction was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried.\nConsidering all the measures mentioned in this report, we reckon that its cash\nburn is fairly risky, and if we held shares we'd be watching like a hawk for any\ndeterioration. Taking a deeper dive, we've spotted you should be aware of, and 3\nof them shouldn't be ignored.\n\nOf course Defiance Silver may not be the best stock to buy.

        "content": "\npepebaeza | stock.adobe.com\n\nMetalX LLC, based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, has selected a 190-acre site in\nDefiance, Ohio, for its previously announced aluminum recycling campus, the\nplans for which include an aluminum slab manufacturing plant, a scrap shredding\nand advanced sortation facility and a dedicated logistics hub.\n\nIn April of last year, the company announced plans to work with Louisville,\nKentucky-based Manna Capital Partners to build a recycled-content aluminum\nrolling slab facility in the Great Lakes region, saying more than $200 million\nwould be invested into what they call a new greenfield aluminum rolling slab\nfacility to be located in northeast Indiana, northwest Ohio or southern\nMichigan.\n\nAccording to JobsOhio, the investment will total $253 million, and MetalX has\ncommitted to creating 180 jobs at the site.\n\nThe slab casting facility will produce 100,000 to 120,000 metric tons per year\ninitially, though it will have the ability to produce as much as 200,000 metric\ntons per year of ultra-low carbon aluminum rolling slab, prioritizing alloys for\nthe beverage, packaging and auto industries. It will feature higher recycled\ncontent than otherwise available in the market, according to the company.\n\nThe advanced scrap processing operation, expanding from MetalX's Indiana base,\nwill enhance separation and shredding for use at the slab facility and by\nthird-party aluminum consumers. It will process up to 300 million pounds per\nyear of material, with roughly 25 percent of the output slated for the slab\nfacility with the rest slated for other consumers. Both facilities are expected\nto be fully operational in the first half of 2027.\n\n\u201cThis is an outstanding site and met all key criteria for the project, including\nproximity to sources of scrap supply; ample power, gas, water and other\nutilities; main-line rail service; access to major highways; and, most\nimportantly, a solid workforce environment,\u201d MetalX CEO Danny Rifkin says. \u201cWe\nare excited to expand into Ohio and are looking forward to a continued\npartnership with the economic development groups who helped us identify and\nselect this site and have provided invaluable guidance through the entire\nprocess. They have all been great to work with.\u201d\n\nErika Willitzer, Defiance County Economic Development executive director, says,\n\u201cWe are ecstatic MetalX chose Defiance County. We know this new investment is\ngoing to have a transformative impact on our local families and northwest Ohio\nfor generations to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetalX had many options when choosing where to build its newest facility and\nchose Ohio,\"\u00a0JobsOhio President and CEO J.P. Nauseef says. \"The investment will\ncome on a readily developable site with critical access to rail that will bring\n180 new jobs to Defiance County.\u201d\n\nMetalX was founded in 2012 by Danny and Neal Rifkin, third- and\nfourth-generation members of the Rifkin family, which founded OmniSource before\nselling that company to Steel Dynamics Inc. With the sale of its ferrous\nprocessing business to BlueScope in late 2021, MetalX\u00a0changed its focus to\nprocessing nonferrous scrap and providing consulting and management services. It\nalso is engaged in applying new technologies for aluminum and copper recycling.\n\nIn mid-2022, MetalX acquired the assets and business of SRT Aluminum in Wabash,\nIndiana, a secondary aluminum melting operation that produces specification\nremelt scrap ingot (RSI) in sow and ingot form using scrap. MetalX renamed the\nbusiness MetalX Aluminum Conversions LLC.\n\nIn 2016, MetalX completed the acquisition of the assets and business of Metal\nShred Industries LLC (MSI), an aluminum scrap toll processor located in\nKendallville, Indiana, retiring the MSI name.\n\nThe former MSI was founded in 2006 as an affiliate of Metropolitan Alloys to\nshred aluminum scrap on a toll basis for a variety of customers in the aluminum\nsector. At the time of the purchase, MetalX said the company designed and\noperates a \u201cunique shredding and separation system that recovers and returns\nhigh-quality shredded aluminum products to its customers.\u201d\n\n * Brandt scrap handler available through Murphy Tractor\n * Hendrickson celebrates Tiremaax installation milestone\n * Study finds progress in global steel decarbonization\n * P+PB online show emphasizes packaging recyclability\n * CRU foresees \u2018green premium\u2019 in steel sector in 2030s\n * Tomra GAINnext sorting device targets UBCs\n * Ascend Elements\u2019 EV battery recycling facility receives certification\n * S3 Recycling Solutions acquires iGlobal Asset Management\n\n 1.

        "content": "Was it a \u201cserious mistake\u201d or a wilful and desperate act of protest against\nworsening press controls? This question remains unanswered one week after a\nheadline news editor at the Shenzhen edition of\u00a0Southern Metropolis Daily, Liu\nCuixia (\u5218\u7fe0\u971e), was fired for her role in a peculiar media scandal \u2014 an incident\nthat top political brass at the paper\u2019s publisher, the Nanfang Daily\nGroup,\u00a0characterised in an internal release\u00a0as \u201ca serious matter of\u00a0guidance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe February 20, 2016, front page of the Shenzhen edition of Southern Metropolis\nDaily.\n\nThe scandal was prompted by the unfortunate \u2014 or defiant? \u2014 pairing of two\nheadlines on the front page of the Shenzhen edition on February 20. The bold\nheadline across the top of the page referenced President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cimportant\nspeech\u201d made the previous day in Beijing, in which he stressed the Chinese\nCommunist Party\u2019s supremacy over all media: \u201cParty and Government Media are\nPropaganda Positions and Must Be Surnamed Party.\u201d\n\nDirectly below this banner coverage \u2014 which all Chinese media were under orders\nto prioritise, along with a photo of the president\u2019s tour of core central Party\nmedia \u2014 was a large photo of the spreading at sea of the ashes of Yuan Geng\n(\u8881\u5e9a), a key founder of the Shekou Industrial Zone. Yuan, an important local\nbusinessman and reformer,\u00a0died on January 31 at the age of 99. The headline of\nthis article read: \u201cA Soul Returns to the Sea.\u201d\n\nThe juxtaposition was either so canny or so casual few might have noticed at\nall. But once eagle-eyed Chinese internet users had noted a certain friction\nbetween the lines, the static energy quickly became electric. If the two\nheadlines were read together vertically, people realised, the \u201chidden-head\u201d\nmessage would be as follows:\n\n> \u5a92\u4f53\n> \u59d3\u515a\n> \u9b42\u5f52\n> \u5927\u6d77\n> \n> Media Are\n> Surnamed Party\n> Their Souls Return\n> To The Sea\n\nThe editors, it seemed, were suggesting that the severe controls on Chinese\nmedia Xi Jinping outlined in his February 19 speech were a death sentence for\nall semblance of journalistic professionalism \u2014 the last nail in the coffin.\n\nIn its statement,\u00a0the Party committee of the Nanfang Daily Group suggested the\neditors had merely lacked \u201cpolitical sensitivity,\u201d\u00a0committing a serious error\nthat had been \u201cinterpreted maliciously by others online.\u201d\n\nStaff at the\u00a0Southern Metropolis Daily\u00a0have suggested the editors would never\nknowingly have taken such risks. \u201cIt can\u2019t have been deliberate,\u201d\u00a0one anonymous\njournalist told the\u00a0New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s just very, very serious. And these\ndays no one would dare to do something like that.\u201d\n\nYes,\u00a0these days\u00a0indeed.\u00a0These days\u00a0are exactly the point.\n\nIntended or not, the message about\u00a0these days\u00a0comes across loud and clear\nbetween the unfortunate headlines. Xi Jinping\u2019s controls on \u201cnews and public\nopinion,\u201d and\u00a0in fact on all forms of expression and dissent, have become so\ndraconian that to many the spirit of reform in China seems, like Yuan Geng\u2019s\nashes, to be slipping into the depths.\n\nIn his February 19 speech, Xi Jinping spoke of the need for \u201cinnovation\u201d in the\narena of media control, increasing the reach, influence and \u201cinfectiveness\u201d of\npropaganda. During a visit to the\u00a0People\u2019s Liberation Army Daily\u00a0back in\nDecember, the president described propaganda as a kraken-like monster, its arms\ntwisting through the media-saturated lives of the public. \u201cWherever the readers\nare, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend\ntheir tentacles,\u201d he said, \u201cand that is where we find the focal point and end\npoint of propaganda and ideology work.\u201d\n\nBut the kraken induces not interest or attraction, but terror. And if the kraken\ninspires \u201cinnovation,\u201d it is defensive only.\n\nFor the nearest analogy to the preposterous level of panic and paranoia at work\nin the recent\u00a0Southern Metropolis Daily\u00a0headline scandal, we must return to the\ntail end of the Cultural Revolution, and to the very newspaper where China\u2019s\nkraken-in-chief aired his comments last December on the \u201cinnovation\u201d of control.\n\nTHE \u201cBLACK BOX SCANDAL\u201d (\u9ed1\u6846\u4e8b\u4ef6)\n\nIt was early evening on July 8, 1974. One by one, the members of the Party\ncommittee of the\u00a0People\u2019s Liberation Army Daily \u2014\u00a0the official mouthpiece of the\nmilitary and one of just three publications dominating China in the midst of the\nCultural Revolution \u2014 received phone calls summoning them to the newspaper\u2019s\nconference room for an unspecified urgent matter.\n\n\n\nPage one of the May 19, 1974, edition of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Daily.\n\nThe senior editors of the\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0crowded into the conference room. Finally,\nin walked the young deputy editor from the newspaper\u2019s \u201cCriticize Lin Biao,\nCriticize Confucius Office.\u201d From his leather satchel he withdrew several copies\nof the paper and said sternly: \u201cComrade Hu Wei (\u80e1\u709c), chairman of the military\ncommission\u2019s Criticize Lin Biao, Criticize Confucius Office, has sent me here\nwith instructions from the centre. Recently, leading central Party comrades\nreceived a letter from the masses pointing out that there is an overlap between\nthe funeral picture of Mr. Lu Han on page two of the May 19 edition of the\u00a0PLA\nDaily, and the picture on page one of Chairman Mao meeting with a foreign\nguest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a serious political error,\u201d the deputy editor continued. \u201cThe emergence\nof this problem is surely not an accident.\u201d He read out a letter, dated June 25,\nfrom Mao Zedong\u2019s fourth wife, Jiang Qing, in which she demanded a thorough\ninvestigation of this \u201cserious political incident.\u201d\n\nAn overlap? What could the young editor possibly have meant?\n\n\n\nPage 2 of the May 1, 1974, edition of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Daily, with\nthe obituary of former KMT general Lu Han.\n\nAs it turned out, the\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0had run, on page two of the May 19 edition, an\nobituary for Lu Han,\u00a0the former Kuomintang general who had defected to the\nChinese Communist Party in 1949. As was customary, editors had included a photo\nof Lu bordered by a thick black box, which in China symbolises death.\n\nPage one of the paper had featured coverage of Mao Zedong\u2019s meeting with\nMakarios III, the first President of the Republic of Cyprus. In an image below\nthe fold, Mao Zedong was pictured sitting in a meeting room with Makarios III.\n\nSeparately, the pages were fine. But when the newspaper was held up to the\nlight, the black border around the page-two photograph of Lu Han became a black\nbox around the image of Mao Zedong.\n\nThe following composite image is an approximation of what the reportedly\nscandalised\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0readers would have seen as light filtered through pages\none and two on the morning of May 19, 1974.\n\n\n\nAs in the case of the recent\u00a0Southern Metropolis Daily\u00a0incident, there was an\nimmediate question of intention in what became known as the \u201cBlack Box Scandal.\u201d\nHad the editors\u00a0knowingly\u00a0designed the paper in such a way as to curse the\nunassailable Chairman Mao?\n\nLikewise, just as the political implications of the recent\u00a0Southern Metropolis\nDaily\u00a0headlines had to be teased out by Chinese on social networks, so had the\n\u201cBlack Box Scandal\u201d been illuminated \u2014 ostensibly, at least \u2014 by \u201cthe masses.\u201d\n\nThe above account of the \u201cBlack Box Scandal\u201d comes directly from Wu Yongchuan\n(\u5434\u6c38\u5ddd), a former deputy director of the\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0who was on duty with another\neditor, Xue Zhen (\u859b\u771f), as the May 19, 1974, edition went to press. Wu gave a\ndetailed account of the event in the December 21, 2000, edition of\nGuangzhou\u2019s\u00a0Southern Weekly.\n\nAccording to Wu, a full investigation was conducted into the incident and both\nhe and Xue Zhen were compelled to make full and public self-examinations.\nThe\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0was ordered to make all necessary adjustments to ensure that such\noffences were not repeated.\n\nAnd so it was, Wu writes, the\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0became the first newspaper in China to\nset up a special\u00a0\u201csearchlight table\u201d\u00a0(\u63a2\u7167\u684c), its top made of transparent glass\nunder which could be placed an electric bulb. As the proofs were reviewed each\nnight, editors studied pages one and two, pages three and four, and so on,\nensuring there were no political violations \u2014 real or imagined. The process was\ncalled\u00a0\u201csearchlighting\u201d\u00a0(\u63a2\u7167).\n\n\n\nIn his essay, \u201cThe Reputation of Millions Can\u2019t Stand Up to One\u2019s Man\u2019s Ruin\u201d\n(\u4e07\u4eba\u4e4b\u8a89\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e00\u4eba\u4e4b\u6bc1), Zhang Xinyang (\u5f20\u5fc3\u9633), one of Wu Yongchuan\u2019s former colleagues,\ntells us that \u201csearchlighting\u201d was eventually extended to the inspection of the\nChinese characters appearing on the backs of photographs of Communist Party\nleaders. The editor responsible for searchlighting had to ensure that no words\nwith negative connotations \u2014 like \u201cdeath,\u201d \u201coverthrow\u201d or \u201ccriticise\u201d \u2014 appeared\non the backs of such images. If possible infractions were found, the pages had\nto be scrapped and redesigned, even if that meant the edition came out late.\n\n\u201cSearchlighting\u201d at the\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0continued through the end of the Cultural\nRevolution. For Zhang Xinyang, the process was a grotesque anomaly \u2014 \u201ca great\ninvention,\u201d he writes acerbically \u2014 highlighting the political excesses of that\npainful time.\n\nZhang writes: \u201cIt entirely surpassed conventional human thought, and innovated\nmethods of reading the newspapers in ways not seen before or since, an entry in\nthe annals of press history.\u201d\n\nBut history, when not properly regarded, has a way of returning, kraken-like,\nfrom the depths. Xi Jinping\u2019s fearsome \u201cinnovations,\u201d should they continue, are\nlikely to spawn new and yet oddly familiar absurdities \u2014 \u201csearchlighting\u201d for\nthe 21st century.\n\nThe former\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0deputy director, Wu Yongchuan, closed his December 2000\naccount of the \u201cBlack Box Scandal\u201d by conceding that the political context of\nhis experience must seem remote to his contemporary readers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d wrote Wu, \u201cthat readers today would find it difficult to imagine\nsuch trials and tribulations in getting a newspaper out, or such a way of\nreading a newspaper.\u201d\n\nAh, Wu Yongquan!\n\nBut these days.\u00a0These days\u00a0. . .\n\n[This essay was originally published by CMP in March 2016.]",

        "content": "on February 9, 2023 at 4:24 pm\n\nMarc Scarpa is the CEO and founder of DeFiance Media. He joined me at the\nSynthedia 2 event to discuss DeFinance\u2019s experience with virtual human\nnewscasters and how the company came to use two in its broadcasts. He started by\ncontrasting the popular view of deepfake technology as a potential threat and\nsaw the potential upside of synthetic technologies.\n\n> I didn\u2019t see [deepfakes] as a threat at all. I saw them as a friend. You are\n> looking at CGI graphics and effects in movies all the time. You can bring back\n> Princess Leia, and now you have Tom Cruise deepfake and Mark Zuckerberg\n> deepfake. Well, that\u2019s a very interesting media play\u2026[when] putting it in a\n> context that can deliver information in a way that is accurate and credible.\n> And hence, we then went on a journey to determine who could solve the first\n> part of the problem, which is the creation of a virtual human so that we could\n> have the world\u2019s first virtual news anchor.\n\n\n\n\nKEY LEARNINGS FROM 1,500 VIRTUAL NEWS ANCHOR SEGMENTS\n\nDeFiance Media\u2019s virtual news anchor Roxanna has completed over 1,500 news\nsegments over the past year. Scarpa said the team learned a number of lessons in\nthat time. For example, \u201cWhat is most important is you can go and start with a\nstock character which is something that we did, but ultimately, we chose to\ncreate our own. That was a huge shift. Our engagement increased. The resonance\nwith our brand really changed.\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned that you need to teach the virtual human how to talk, and it\nneeds to have a personality. \u201cGiving her a little more personality and a life is\nreally critical. If you don\u2019t do that, it is, in essence, a robot on stage\nreading a teleprompter,\u201d said Scarpa. That personality then shapes how you use\nthe virtual human, in what formats, and for what topics. It also drives the\nscript writing to reflect the virtual human\u2019s personality.\n\nYou can see Roxanna delivering a news segment in the video above. We included\ntwo clips of her reading the news. Also, you can check out DeFiance Media and\nsee Roxanna in action here.\n\n\nMORE VIDEOS ON SYNTHETIC MEDIA\n\nYou can learn more about synthetic media from other speakers at the Synthedia\nConference.

Weekly programs will be hosted by Patrick Tsang,\nSarah Austin, Matt McKibbon, Ted Moskovitz, Mike Matsumura, Alex Chizhik, Shimon\nLazarov, Steve McGarry, Siraj Raval, and Freya Fox.\n\nThe company hopes to make money several ways: with ad-revenue shares from\ncarriers, branded entertainment/sponsored content, events, content licensing to\nGetty Images and similar outlets, and transactional markets, among other\npotential opportunities.\n\nDeFiance is based in Puerto Rico, and has a studio in the Venice neighborhood of\nLos Angeles, Scarpa said. But in keeping with its core subject matter, the\noperation is heavily decentralized, with contributors and programming coming\nfrom numerous cities.\n\nThe company has been raising a seed round of about $2 million, Scarpa said.\n\nIt counts among its investors and advisers a number of notables in the\nblockchain world and related areas, including investor Brock Pierce, who is\nlong-time chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation; Eric Pulier, founder of Vatom;\nDoug Scott, founder of gaming culture company Subnation; Hong Kong investor and\npodcast host Patrick P.L.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Alexei Navalny was arrested in January 2021, tens of\nthousands of Russians filled the streets in protest, demanding that the top\nKremlin critic be released and chanting slogans against President Vladimir\nPutin. Thousands were arrested.\n\nSince then, Putin has unleashed the harshest crackdown since the era of the\nSoviet Union: Navalny was imprisoned and his organization outlawed. His\nassociates and other activists were either prosecuted, fled the country or had\ntheir hands tied by draconian new laws. Independent news outlets were blocked\nand social media platforms banned.\n\nAnd now, Russia has sent its military into Ukraine, the largest invasion in\nEurope since World War II.\n\nBut while the Kremlin has worked hard to crush political dissent and opposition\nto the war, flickers of defiance have emerged.\n\nAntiwar marches of protesters chanting \u201cNo to war!\u201d occurred in Moscow, St.\nPetersburg and elsewhere after the Feb. 24 invasion, with more than 15,000\npeople detained, according to the OVD-Info rights group that tracks political\narrests.\n\nA silent demonstrator in the city of Nizhny Novgorod displayed a blank sign and\nwas promptly detained by police.\n\nA live evening news broadcast on Russia\u2019s state TV was interrupted March 14 by a\nwoman who walked behind the anchor and held up a handmade poster protesting the\nwar in English and Russian. OVD-Info identified her as Marina Ovsyannikova, an\nemployee of the station, who was taken into custody and fined.\n\nNavalny remained unbowed at a trial held in the penal colony where he is serving\na 2 1/2-year sentence. On Tuesday, he was convicted on fraud and contempt of\ncourt charges and given nine years \u2014 a move that was seen as an attempt to keep\nPutin\u2019s biggest foe behind bars for as long as possible.\n\nThe 45-year-old corruption fighter, who in 2020 survived a poisoning with a\nnerve agent that he blames on the Kremlin, said on Facebook in a sardonic\ncomment that was posted by his team: \u201cMy space flight is taking a bit longer\nthan expected.\u201d\n\nNavalny ally Ilya Yashin, who has vowed to remain in Russia, also spoke out\nagainst the increased jail time.\n\n\u201cOf course, nine years is a stiff sentence,\u201d Yashin said on Facebook. \u201cRapists,\nthieves and murderers in Russia often get less. ... But in reality (the\nsentence) doesn\u2019t mean anything, because everyone understands: Alexei will spend\nas much time behind bars as Putin will sit in the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nAddressing Putin, Yashin added sarcastically, \u201cYou\u2019re quite the optimist.\u201d\n\nNavalny\u2019s trial, which began a week before Russian troops rolled into Ukraine,\nprompted a small act of defiance by one of the witnesses for the prosecution.\nFyodor Gorozhanko, a former activist in Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation,\nwho has since left Russia, testified that he had been coerced to give evidence\nagainst the opposition leader.\n\nNavalny\u2019s foundation and a nationwide network of regional offices were outlawed\nlast year as extremist and ceased operating. The Kremlin also turned up the heat\non other opposition activists and groups, as well as on independent media and\nhuman rights organizations.\n\nDozens have been slapped with a crippling \u201cforeign agent\u201d label, which implies\nadditional government scrutiny and scorn. Many have been forced to shut down\nunder pressure.\n\nWith the invasion of Ukraine, the crackdown has been expanded \u2014 all but\nsilencing most independent news sites. Facebook and Instagram were banned as\nextremist and were blocked in Russia. Twitter also was blocked, although\nRussians who use virtual private networks, or VPNs, are able to avoid access\nrestrictions to the social media networks and news outlets banned in Russia.\n\nA new law was rubber-stamped by the parliament, criminalizing content that\ndeviates from the official line as \u201cfake news\u201d or which discredits the Russian\nmilitary and its actions in Ukraine. Media outlets have faced pressure over\ncalling the action a \u201cwar\u201d or an \u201cinvasion,\u201d rather than using the government\u2019s\ndescription of it as a \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d The first criminal cases\nunder the new law appeared shortly after it was adopted and, among others,\nimplicated two prominent public figures who condemned the offensive on social\nmedia.\n\nNavalny\u2019s team has been undeterred by both the war and the trial of its leader,\nannouncing it was rebooting the foundation as an international organization.\n\n\u201cCorruption kills,\u201d read its new website. \u201cAs Ukrainian cities are bombed by\nPutin, this has never been more obvious. Putin and his circle have done\neverything to stay in power \u2014 and steal, and steal, and steal some more. High on\ntheir own impunity, they unleashed a war.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will find all of their mansions in Monaco and their villas in Miami, and\nwhen we do, we will make sure Putin\u2019s elite loses everything it owns,\u201d the\nstatement said. \u201cWe have been fighting Putin since 2011. We will fight him until\nwe win.\u201d\n\nThe Navalny team also promoted a new YouTube channel it has launched, Popular\nPolitics, that since March 5 has attracted more than 920,000 subscribers.\n\nOn Monday, it released a video on YouTube alleging that Putin owns a $700\nmillion super yacht, which is in an Italian port. The new expose has gotten over\n2.8 million views by Tuesday evening. The New York Times reported earlier this\nmonth that the vessel\u2019s captain denied Putin owned or had ever been on the\nyacht.\n\nThe allegations came in stark contrast to Putin\u2019s recent ominous remarks\ncondemning those who oppose the war in Ukraine and juxtaposing elites \u201cwho have\nvillas in Miami or the French Riviera, those who can\u2019t live without foie gras,\noysters\u201d to \u201cour people\u201d and \u201cRussia.\u201d\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, an exiled Russian oil tycoon who spent a decade in prison\nin Russia on charges widely seen as revenge for challenging Putin\u2019s rule, spoke\nTuesday of his optimism for Navalny.\n\n\u201cNine years were handed to Navalny. However, what does it matter? What matters\nis how much time Putin has left. And here I think there is some good news for\nAlexei,\u201d Khodorkovsky tweeted.",

        "content": "Chief international correspondent for CNN Clarissa Ward has become one of the\nfirst Western journalists to report from Gaza during the current conflict in\ndefiance of a media ban.\n\nSince 7 October, the Erez crossing between Israel and Gaza has been closed,\nprohibiting journalists from entering. The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza\nhas not permitted journalists to cross since the war started.\n\nHowever, Ward has made her way in. So far, at least 63 journalists have been\nkilled during the Israel-Hamas, the vast majority killed by Israeli action.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe enjoyed a very privileged position on this occasion, we did feel\nrelatively safe, we were only on the ground for a matter of hours.\u201d\n\nReporting on the damage she saw, Ward added: \u201cI can honestly say I don\u2019t think\nwe\u2019ve ever seen it quite on this scale.\u201d\n\nThe ban on international reporters has resulted in a reliance on Palestinian\njournalists, aid and health workers, and social media for updates.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly cut off phone communications and internet from Gaza during\nthe war.\n\nCONTENT FROM OUR PARTNERS\n\nIsrael has permitted some journalists to enter, but only under the supervision\nof the Israeli Defence Force (IDF).\n\nStories covered on these visits must be reviewed by Israel, prompting concerns\nabout accuracy. The BBC, Channel 4 and CNN are among those to have reported via\nthe IDF. In an interview for CNN\u2019s \u2018Tug of War\u2019 podcast, CNN reporter Jeremy\nDiamond explained his experience of entering Gaza with the IDF in early\nNovember.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe operated under the observation of Israeli commanders in the field.\nWe weren\u2019t allowed to move unaccompanied within Gaza. And as a condition of\nentering Gaza under escort with the IDF, we also had to submit all of our\nmaterials and footage to the Israeli military for review before publication.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to note that the Israeli military only asked us to\ndelete one piece of footage which showed sensitive military technology on one of\ntheir armoured personnel carriers.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Press Association (FPA), an NGO representing international\njournalists reporting from Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, has challenged\nIsrael\u2019s ban.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \u201cIsrael has always enabled access to Gaza during and\nafter previous rounds of fighting.\n\n\u201cIt also is legally obligated, under a previous supreme court ruling.\u201d In 2008,\nIsrael\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that journalists must be allowed entry into Gaza\neven during ongoing conflict.\n\nEmail pged@pressgazette.co.uk to point out mistakes, provide story tips or send\nin a letter for publication on our \"Letters Page\" blog",

The fund intends to pay Distributions, if any, on a monthly basis.\n\n\u201cInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and\nexpenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with\nthis and other information about the Fund, please call 833.333.9383. Read the\nprospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.\u201d\n\nInvesting involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at\nmarket price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund.\nBrokerage commissions will reduce returns.\n\nIndex Overview: The Russell 2000 Index is a widely recognized benchmark index\nthat tracks the performance of approximately 2000 small-cap companies in the\nUnited States. These are the smallest companies listed in the Russell 3000\nIndex, representing about 10% of that index\u2019s total market capitalization.\n\nIndirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund,\nthe Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved\nwith this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to\nreceive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the\ncompanies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the\nperformance of the Index.\n\nIndex Trading Risk. The trading price of the Index may be highly volatile and\ncould continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various\nfactors. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of companies.\n\nRussell 2000 Index Risks: The Index, which includes a broad swath of large U.S.\ncompanies, is primarily exposed to overall economic and market conditions.\nRecession, inflation, and changes in interest rates can significantly impact the\nindex\u2019s performance. Furthermore, despite its diverse representation, a downturn\nin a major sector such as technology or financials could notably affect the\nindex. Geopolitical risks and unexpected global events, like pandemics, can\nintroduce volatility and uncertainty.\n\nDerivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from\nthe underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds\n(including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund\u2019s investments in\nderivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated\nwith directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including\nrisk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments,\nhigher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity,\nvaluation and legal restrictions.\n\nPrice Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes\nthe sale of in-the-money put option contracts, which limits the degree to which\nthe Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the Index over\nthe Call Period (typically, one day, but may range up to one week). This means\nthat if the Index experiences an increase in value above the strike price of the\nsold put options during a Call Period, the Fund will likely not experience that\nincrease to the same extent and may significantly underperform the Index over\nthe Call Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to\nwhich it will participate in increases in value experienced by the Index over\neach Call Period, but has full exposure to any decreases in value experienced by\nthe Index over the Call Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given\ntime period.\n\nDistribution Risk. As part of the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Fund seeks to\nprovide current monthly income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a\ndistribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the\namounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to\nthe next.\n\nNew Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company\nwith no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a\ntrack record or history on which to base their investment decisions.\n\nHigh Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or\na significant portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate\nincreases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund\u2019s expenses.\n\nLiquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts,\nmay be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market\nturmoil. This risk is greater for the Fund as it will hold options contracts on\na single security, and not a broader range of options contracts.\n\nPut Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the\nFund\u2019s put writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in\nthe positive price returns of the Index and, in turn, the Fund\u2019s returns, both\nduring the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods.\n\nDisclosures: Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund\u2019s investment adviser\nis Toroso Investments, LLC (\u201cToroso\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d). The Fund Administrator\nis Tidal ETF Services LLC. The investment sub-adviser is ZEGA Financial, LLC\n(\u201cZEGA\u201d or the \u201cSub-Adviser\u201d).\n\nIWMY is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.",

With a relentless focus on innovation, Defiance is\nrevolutionizing the sector by offering investors unparalleled opportunities to\npotentially capitalize on the transformative power of nuclear energy.\n\nURAX is poised to capitalize on a potential global shift towards nuclear power\nas a clean, reliable, and efficient energy source. With increasing demand for\nuranium- driven by the expansion of nuclear power generation worldwide and\ngrowing recognition of its role in combating climate change, URAX provides\ntraders with leveraged exposure to this burgeoning market.\n\nCommenting on the launch, Sylvia Jablonski, Chief Executive Officer at Defiance\nETFs, stated, \"We are thrilled to introduce URAX, the first leveraged ETF in\nuranium. This ETF reflects our commitment to providing investors with innovative\nopportunities to capitalize on emerging trends and disruptive technologies. With\nURAX, traders can now leverage the potential of nuclear energy.\u201d\n\nAbout Defiance ETFs\nFounded in 2018, Defiance stands as a leading ETF issuer dedicated to income and\nthematic investing.\n\nOur suite of first-mover\u00a0leveraged &\u00a0thematic ETFs empowers investors to express\ntargeted views on disruptive innovations, including artificial intelligence,\nmachine learning, and quantum computing, while our actively managed options ETFs\nare designed to seek high income with lower volatility.\n\n\nImportant Disclosures\n\nThe fund attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to two\ntimes (200%) the share price performance of an underlying exchange-traded fund\n(an \"Underlying Security\"). The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not\nappropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage\ntheir portfolios. The Fund is very different from most mutual funds and\nexchange-traded funds.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s investment adviser will not attempt to position a Fund's portfolio to\nensure that the Fund does not gain or lose more than a maximum percentage of its\nnet asset value on a given trading day. As a consequence, if an Underlying\nSecurity's share price referenced by a Fund decreases by more than 50% on a\ngiven trading day, the corresponding Fund's investors could lose all of their\nmoney.\n\nThe Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective for a period\nother than a single trading day.\n\nDefiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund\u2019s investment adviser is Tidal\nInvestments, LLC (\u201cTidal\u201d or the \u201cAdviser\u201d).\n\nFund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change at any time and\nshould not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security.\n\nThe Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be\nconsidered carefully before investing. The\u00a0prospectus contains this and other\nimportant information about the investment company. Please read carefully before\ninvesting. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling\n833.333.9383.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. High ratings does not assure\nfavorable performance.\n\nInvesting involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds may\ntrade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at\nmarket price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A\nportfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a\nhigher degree of risk.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the Fund\u2019s investment strategy will be properly\nimplemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment.\n\nNone of the Fund, the Trust, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, or their respective\naffiliates makes any representation to you as to the performance of the Index.\nTHE FUND, TRUST, ADVISER, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH, NOR ENDORSED\nBY, THE INDEX.\n\nThe Daily Target 2X Long Uranium ETF (the \u201cFund\u201d) seeks daily leveraged\ninvestment results of two times (200%) the daily percentage change in the share\nprice of the Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE Arca: URA) (the \u201cUnderlying Security\u201d or\n\u201cURA\u201d). Because the Fund seeks daily leveraged investment results, it is very\ndifferent from most other exchange-traded funds. It is also riskier than\nalternatives that do not use leverage.\n\nUnderlying Security Risk. The underlying security is subject to many risks that\ncan negatively impact the Fund. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund\ninvests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund\nwill fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest\nrates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the\nFund. Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause\nfluctuations in the market value of the Fund's portfolio to have\ndisproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to\ndecline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives may be\nmore sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks. Foreign\nand Emerging Markets Risks. Investments in foreign securities may involve risks\nsuch as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate\nfluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Investing in\nemerging markets involves different and greater risks, as these countries are\nsubstantially smaller, less liquid and more volatile than securities markets in\nmore developed markets. Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The\nFund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund's performance for\nperiods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day's returns\ncompounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from the Fund\nperformance, before fees and expenses. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific\nattributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a\ntraditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally.\nThe value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more\nvolatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may\nperform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the\nmarket as a whole. New Fund Risk. As of the date of this prospectus, the Fund\nhas no operating history and currently has fewer assets than larger funds. Like\nother new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the Fund's market\nexposure for limited periods of time.\n\nDiversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining\nmarket.\n\nCommissions may be charged on trades.\n\nURAX is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at\n\nCONTACT: CONTACT: David Hanono Defiance ETFs +1 833-333-9383\n\n",

The company is appealing that decision and Christie did not\nhold back in his first substantial comments since the judge ruled the corporate\nmarriage would be anti-competitive and hurt air travelers.\n\n\"It is beyond absurd for the government to claim a victory for the American\nconsumer. In fact, it is ridiculous,\" Christie said.\n\nHe claimed blocking JetBlue from buying Spirit \"perpetuates a small group of\n'haves' that control the market at the expense of the 'have nots' and the\nAmerican consumer.\"\n\nJetBlue is the sixth largest carrier while Spirit is seventh. A merger would\nmake the combined carrier the fifth largest with about 10% market share. The\nnext largest airline would be United with 16% market share, according to Bureau\nof Transportation data.\n\n\"After 20-plus years of working for lower-cost carriers, it has become ever more\nclear to me that we exist in an uneven playing field,\" Christie said.\n\nThe carriers are the dominant airlines serving the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood\nInternational Airport. Together, they were responsible for almost half of the\npassenger air traffic from January through November, the latest time period\navailable from Broward County.\n\nThe company hopes to reassure passengers and investors that even as it continues\nto fight for the merger, its business is improving.\n\nSpirit said spring break travel reservations are strong. In the past year the\ncarrier added 55 new routes and ended or suspended more than three dozen in\norder to concentrate on more profitable flights, including those in and out of\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\n\"Some of it has gone to Fort Lauderdale where we continue to see very good\nstrength,\" said Spirit Chief Commercial Officer Matt Klein. He also pointed to\nthe New York metropolitan market as a place with strong passenger demand.\n\nREAD MORE: Buyout or bankruptcy: Are those the only options for Broward-based\nSpirit Airlines?\n\nThe company's stock price remains about half what it was the day before its\nJetBlue buy-out was blocked. That ruling brought investor concerns about the\nairline's financial position. Christie called speculation about the company's\nability to survive a \"misguided narrative.\"\n\nThe company reported it ended last year with access to $1.3 billion in cash and\ncredit. Spirit lost $183 million in the fourth quarter. For the entire year, it\nwas $447 million in the red. Both are improvements compared to a year earlier.\n\n\"It\u2019s progress in the right direction that gives us confidence that we can start\nmoving the cash needle in the right way,\" Klein said.\n\nIt also forecast that it will be cash flow positive in the second quarter\nthrough the rest of the year.\n\nSpirit's outlook includes some amount of money it expects to receive from jet\nengine maker Pratt and Whitney, which has grounded planes as their engines are\ninspected for a problem and repaired. Spirit expects dozens of its planes to be\nout of service throughout the year. The two companies are negotiating a\nsettlement for the disruption, but there is no agreement yet.",

        "link": "https://shorttermrentalz.com/news/airbnb-defiant-outlook-q4-losses-2023/",
        "content": "Reading Time: 3 minutes\n\nUS: Airbnb has projected a defiant outlook for the year ahead which it views as\nan \u201cinflection point\u201d for the business, despite posting an unexpectedly high\nloss for the fourth quarter of 2023 in its latest earnings report.\n\nMuch of Airbnb\u2019s optimism for the year ahead is rooted in the strong demand the\ncompany is observing in key markets across the world, fuelling a boost to\ninternational travel plans as domestic tourism slows. The home-sharing platform\nreported notably sustained demand in Asia-Pacific [China seeing a 90 per cent\nyear-over-year surge in demand] and Latin America, driven by an uptick in\nAmerican traveller numbers, while it targets building its offering in countries\nsuch as Germany, Brazil and South Korea that offer opportunities for sizeable\nfuture growth.\n\nBooking trends\n\nStrong Q4 travel demand worldwide translated into a 12 per cent rise in nights\nand experiences booked to 98.8 million \u2013 a record for a fourth quarter in Airbnb\nearnings reports.\n\nAt the same time, long-term stays lasting 28 days or longer [a segment that CEO\nBrian Chesky previously quoted as the largest growing across Airbnb\u2019s business]\ncontinued to grow, and trips with a duration of three months or longer increased\nby almost 20 per cent on the equivalent quarter in 2022.\n\nAirbnb attributed the latest figures to sustained cross-border travel and longer\nduration bookings in 2023. However, the company urged caution as it expected the\nincremental rise in nights booked in Q3 to moderate in Q4 due to the almost\nunprecedented levels of international travel demand and marked rebound in urban\nmarkets over the summer \u2013 a slowdown which is likely to continue into the first\nquarter figures.\n\nChallenges\n\nElsewhere, Q4 revenue saw a 17 per cent YoY uptick on 2022 levels to $2.2\nbillion, although it represented the slowest pace of growth for any quarter\nacross the year. Airbnb, though, anticipates that revenue will dip down to\nbetween $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion in the current quarter as travellers\nscale down on trips due to soaring costs and the continuing economic and\ngeopolitical instability in markets around the world.\n\nFollowing the news in December that Airbnb had agreed to pay $621 million [\u20ac576\nmillion] to tax authorities in Italy due to overhanging allegations that it had\nfailed to collect a mandatory 21 per cent of landlords\u2019 rental income as per a\n2017 law, the firm posted a net loss of $349 million for Q4.\n\nIn more mixed news, Airbnb shares fell by five per cent in extended trading\nhours, despite climbing nine per cent as the earnings were initially announced.\n\nOpportunities for \u201clong-term growth\u201d\n\nAs part of the earnings call, Airbnb launched a $6 billion share buyback\nprogramme as part of a broader company capital allocation strategy to expand\nbeyond its core services in the near future. The company\u2019s\u00a0total share\nrepurchases totalled $2.25 billion for 2023 as a whole.\n\nSupply growth will be increasingly crucial to the firm\u2019s long-term goals of\npushing into new areas to drive growth. For the first time, Airbnb said that it\nhad passed the milestone of five million hosts on its platform, while there was\nan 18 per cent rise in active listings to 7.7 million in the fourth quarter.\n\nDouble-digit supply growth was observed in all global regions where Airbnb is\nactive, with the biggest increases in inventory being reported in Asia-Pacific\nand Latin America. As well as Germany, Brazil and South Korea, the home-sharing\nplatform is eyeing making similar inroads in \u201cunder-penetrated international\nmarkets\u201d such as Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands in Europe, and more\nareas in\u00a0Asia.\n\nChesky said that this supply growth was \u201ca long-term indication of growth and\nAirbnb\u201d, pointing out that 36 per cent of the platform\u2019s newest hosts are prior\nguests. It comes after Airbnb unveiled a \u2018Guest Favorites\u2019 filter in its\nNovember Winter Release, a tool which will operate alongside Airbnb\u2019s existing\nSuperhosts filter to promote high-quality host standards on its platform and\ntempt traditional hotel guests over to the short-term rental category.\n\nLooking ahead, Airbnb will prioritise continuing to develop its core services\nbefore pushing into new growth areas beyond travel as part of a \u201cmulti-year\nstrategy\u201d.\n\n2024 to be a year to \u201creinvent\u201d Airbnb\n\nChesky in particular sees 2024 as a year when his company can \u201creinvent\u201d itself\nfor hosts and guests, after facing challenges in 2023 ranging from regulatory\nobstacles in key markets such as New York City to the authority repayments in\nItaly and shrinking profit margins.\n\nHaving reported strong free cash flow for the most recent quarter, the CEO says\nthat Airbnb will be able to \u201cdo things we never could have imagined\u201d, including\nmaking further advances in artificial intelligence [AI] and completing strategic\nacquisitions.\n\nIn November, Airbnb acquired stealth AI company GamePlanner.AI in a transaction\nestimated to be worth just under $200 million. At the time, the firm said that\nit would use the expertise of GamePlanner.AI to accelerate select AI projects\nand integrate its tools into its own platform, while it already uses AI in large\nlanguage models, computer vision models and machine learning, and an AI-powered\nPhoto Tour tool.",

He\nreferred to the girls' action as \"outside [accepted] norms\" and expressed regret\nthat some alumnae had not complied with \"academic regulations and dignity.\"\n\nKish Island, off the southern coast of Iran in the Persian Gulf with a\npopulation of around 40,000, is a free trade zone and a very popular destination\nof tourists. The international campus of Sharif University of Technology, one of\nIran's most prestigious universities, has around 900 students.\n\nThe girls' bold defiance of compulsory hijab has angered pro-establishment media\nand social media users, leading to criticism of authorities for perceived lapses\nin enforcing hijab rules.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the public relations department of Sharif University\nof Technology reported that the chancellor and educational deputy of the\nuniversity refused to stay in the ceremony until the end and left the venue due\nto observed violations of hijab rules during the awards ceremony.\n\nIn its statement, the university apologized to the \u201cesteemed families of\nmartyrs, veterans and all who are devoted to the Islamic Republic\u201d and vowed to\ntake serious and immediate action against those who defied the rules as well as\nothers whose carelessness caused the incident.\n\nGraduation ceremony without hijab is disdaining the existence of the Islamic\nRepublic! From the south to the north of the country, from the east to the west,\nprogressive students have taken sleep from the eyes of the [regime] criminals,\noppressors and bullies!,\u201dDaneshjooyan-e Pishro (Progressive Students), a loose\nnetwork of dissident students which has been active in various universities\nsince 2019, tweeted about the incident.\n\nOther student groups have also welcomed Sharif University\u2019s defiance of hijab at\ntheir graduation ceremony. A student newsletter run by dissident students at\nTehran\u2019s Amirkabir University of Technology called their move \u201ccivil\ndisobedience\u201d.\n\nSince Mahsa Amini\u2019s death in custody after being arrested for what morality\npolice considered as \u201cunfitting hijab\u201d in September last year which sparked\nseveral months of protests across the country, particularly in universities,\ndefiance of hijab has hugely grown in the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn recent months authorities have adopted a strict initiative to enforce the\nhijab rules at any cost including measures such as impounding cars if passengers\ndefy the hijab rules, shutting down businesses such as cafes, restaurants, and\nshopping malls, and banned hijab-defiant celebrities from acting in films.\n\nIn October authorities revoked the medical license of a female surgeon in Amol\nin northern Iran after she appeared at a public awards ceremony on Doctors Day\nwithout wearing the hijab. Dr Fatemeh Rajayi-Rad was forced to appear in full\nhijab on state media and apologize for causing offense.\n\nIn another instance, the CEO of a prominent pharmaceutical company, Haleh\nHamedifard, who had a headscarf on, was denied entry to the health ministry to\nattend a meeting with the officials because hijab enforcers stationed at the\nministry said the tunic she had worn over trousers was too short.",

Some decades later, the Gulf war was the first to be broadcast live\non television. Ten years after that almost everyone recalls seeing live footage\nof the plane hitting the second tower of the World Trade Centre. More recently,\nthe role of social media during the Arab Spring in the early 2010s led some to\ndescribe it as the \u201cFacebook revolution\u201d.\n\nSoon after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, commentators began calling this\nconflict the first \u201cTikTok war\u201d because of the degree to which Ukrainians have\nbeen sharing videos of their experiences on the platform. But this wave of\ncitizen journalism has extended well beyond TikTok. Ukrainians have been sharing\nphotos, videos and personal stories on Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and other\nplatforms.\n\nCivilians provided the view from the ground even before media organisations\ncould get there, and they have done so in a highly effective and poignant way.\nUkrainians and their political leaders have used social media not just to inform\npeople about the developments on the ground, but also to relay their emotions\nand defiance.\n\nImages don\u2019t simply inform us about global events we can\u2019t see directly. They\nalso shape our understanding of and engagement with the human suffering they\nportray. To think about the ways images can affect audiences we can consider the\nEuropean response to two major refugee crises: the current situation resulting\nfrom Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nAt the time of writing, close to three million Ukrainians have fled their\ncountry and become refugees. This is several times the total number of refugees\nwho arrived in Europe from Syria over the course of a full year in 2015. And yet\nthe European response to today\u2019s refugee crisis is very different.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more: Refugees in the media: how the most commonly used images make viewers\ndehumanise them\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt present, we are witnessing an unprecedented pan-European humanitarian effort\nspearheaded by citizens who are generously offering shelter and aid to\nUkrainians. Back in 2015, there were heated debates among EU governments\nconcerning the level of support that they could offer, and European politicians\noften struggled to gain approval from their citizens to welcome Syrians.\n\nThere are of course substantial historical and geopolitical factors that\nprobably contribute to these differing responses. But one other likely influence\nrelates to the way in which this war is being visually communicated in western\nmedia \u2013 from newspapers and television broadcasts to Twitter, Instagram and\nTikTok \u2013 and the emotional responses these images elicit.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to conclusively analyse the ways in which Ukrainian\nrefugees are visually depicted in western media, it seems that the focus has\noften been on portraying individuals or small groups of vulnerable people. For\nexample, we\u2019ve seen many images of children and their mothers as they are\nparting with their fathers and homeland.\n\nFurther, much of the visual content comes from social media posts by citizens\nthemselves, which gives an additional directness to the personal story behind\nthe images.\n\nSuch powerful images of identifiable victims are known to make audiences feel\nmore empathy as compared to, say, statistics. Exposure to these kinds of images\nhas also been shown to be linked to prosocial attitudes, such as increased\ndonations.\n\nAs we and other researchers have shown, in terms of imagery, the Syrian refugee\ncrisis was portrayed differently. The majority of images used by western media\ndepicted Syrian refugees in large anonymised groups. We found that the nature of\nthe images people see has far-reaching political consequences. Participants in\nour research who were exposed to images of big groups of refugees were less\nlikely to support pro-refugee policies than people who saw images of smaller\ngroups where individuals could be identified.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more: A short history of Ukraine's relationship with the European Union\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is another possible reason that could partly explain why European\naudiences may be more likely to show greater levels of empathy today than in\n2015. It\u2019s uncomfortable to acknowledge, but social neuroscientists have studied\nextensively when and how we display empathy, and have found that we\u2019re more\nlikely to respond more empathically to images of people who look more like us.\n\nIn laboratory settings using mainly images of people who could be in pain,\nresearchers have shown that our brains\u2019 empathic responses are stronger for\npeople from our own racial group than for people from different racial groups.\n\nBrain imaging research has also shown that perceived physical distance\ninfluences our empathic responses. That is, we\u2019re likely to respond more\nstrongly to someone in pain who we perceive is closer to us compared to someone\nwho we think is further away. So our automatic empathic responses are primarily\ngeared towards others who are physically, socially and emotionally close to us.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more: Why Zelenskyy\u2019s \u2018selfie videos\u2019 are helping Ukraine win the PR war\nagainst Russia\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEuropeans live in some of the most affluent and developed parts of the world.\nToday, many Europeans also feel closer to human suffering than we have been for\ndecades.\n\nHopefully the emotional responses evoked by the countless images portraying the\nsuffering of Ukrainians as they flee their country will have a long-standing\nand, importantly, generalised effect. This means seeking to view human suffering\nbeyond its geographical location or any perceived divide between \u201cus\u201d and\n\u201cthem\u201d, and responding with empathy.",

The social media platform\ntemporarily removed the ability to search for Swift\u2019s name on X after the\nexplicit content was viewed tens of millions of times.\n\nOnly ten states currently have criminal laws against this form of manipulated\nmedia files. If the DEFIANCE Act passes, the bill would become the first federal\nlaw that would protect victims of deepfakes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNobody\u2014neither celebrities nor ordinary Americans\u2014should ever have to find\nthemselves featured in AI pornography,\u201d said Sen. Josh Hawley, one of four\nlegislators who introduced the bill, in a press release. \u201cInnocent people have a\nright to defend their reputations and hold perpetrators accountable in court.\nThis bill will make that a reality.\u201d\n\nNonconsensual pornographic deepfakes are alarmingly easy to access and create.\n\u201cStarting at the very top, there's a search engine where you can search \u2018How do\nI make a deepfake\u2019 that then will give you a bunch of links,\u201d Carrie Goldberg,\nan attorney who represents tech abuse victims, previously told TIME. Deepfake\nsoftware takes a person\u2019s photos and face-swaps them onto pornographic videos,\nmaking it appear as if the subject is partaking in sexual acts.\u00a0\n\nA 2019 study found that 96% of all deepfake videos were nonconsensual\npornography.\n\nThe movement to address deepfakes seems to have mounting support, as Rep. Joe\nMorelle had previously introduced the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images\nAct, which would criminalize the non-consensual sharing of deepfakes, last May.\nThere has been no action taken on that bill, however, since its introduction.\nAmericans seem to overwhelmingly support federal action against deepfakes\u201484%\nsay they are in favor of legislation that would make non-consensual deepfake\nporn illegal, recent polling by the Artificial Intelligence Policy Institute\nshows.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeepfakes that spread misinformation, cause defamation, or commit copyright\ninfringement\u2014those fit fairly neatly into our framework of laws designed to\naddress such harms,\u201dSyracuse University professor Nina Brown, who specializes in\nthe intersection of media law and technology, told TIME Wednesday. \u201cAt the same\ntime, laws are not enough. Social sharing platforms need to commit to investing\nresources in ensuring that deepfakes aren\u2019t allowed to exist on their\nplatforms.\u201d\n\n\nMORE MUST-READS FROM TIME",
