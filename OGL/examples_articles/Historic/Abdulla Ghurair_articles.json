HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum\n\nChairman, Emirates / Emirates NBD\n\nSector: Diversified\n\nOverall rank: 1\n\nThe uncle of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum takes his\nposition at the top of our list this year in part due to the diminishing\nfortunes of those around him, but few would argue he doesn\u2019t deserve to be here\nafter decades overseeing some of Dubai\u2019s most important businesses, and a\nparticularly impressive 2017. He was appointed as president of Dubai\u2019s\nDepartment of Civil Aviation in 1985 and has since led its associated businesses\n\u2013 Dubai Airports and Dubai Duty Free \u2013 plus the carrier founded at the same\ntime, Emirates, to punch far above their weight and become global leaders in\ntheir respective fields. Among the highlights of the last 12 months was a return\nto form at Emirates, which saw net profit rise 111 per cent in the first half of\nits fiscal year despite challenging conditions. He also oversaw a partnership of\nthe airline and its low cost sister flydubai and major Boeing aircraft orders by\nthe two at the Dubai Airshow worth $42.1bn at list prices. This is of course not\nto mention the progress at the various other entities Sheikh Ahmed chairs\nincluding rising passenger traffic at Dubai International Airport, a 17 per cent\nQ4 profit rise at Dubai\u2019s largest bank Emirates NBD and the ground breaking of\nthe UAE pavilion at the Expo 2020 site.\n\n2. HE Mohamed Alabbar\n\nChairman, Emaar / Eagle Hills\n\n\n\nSector: Real estate\n\nOverall rank: 6\n\nDespite mostly being known for his property empire via Emaar and Abu Dhabi\nventure Eagle Hills, it was Mohammed Alabbar\u2019s moves in e-commerce that captured\nmedia attention in 2017. After missing out on the acquisition of Souq.com to\nAmazon, the Emirati billionaire made a series of deals in the space including\nthe purchase of a large stake in regional venture capital fund Middle East\nVenture Partners (MEVP), the acquisition of online selling platform JadoPado via\nan investment consortium and Emaar Malls\u2019 deal to buy 51 per cent of fashion\nsite Namshi for $151m. These moves were followed by the September launch of his\nlong-awaited $1bn e-commerce platform Noon.com in the UAE after it achieved new\nbacking from investors including Kuwaiti retailer MH Alshaya. A Saudi launch\nfollowed in December and in the time in between Alabbar led Dubai\u2019s first major\nIPO in three years with the listing of Emaar\u2019s development unit for around\n$1.3bn. On top of this, Emaar opened a new mega mall in Turkey, laid the\nfoundation for a new record-breaking tower to rival its Burj Khalifa at Dubai\nCreek and saw its Q3 profit increase 32 per cent. All showing property was still\nvery much on Alabbar\u2019s mind.\n\n3. HE Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak\n\nGroup CEO and managing director, Mubadala Investment Company\n\n\n\nSector: Diversified\n\nOverall rank: 8\n\nIt has been a landmark year for Al Mubarak, a prolific businessman and trusted\nadvisor to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Crown Prince, HH Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, after the\nofficial unveiling of new state investment vehicle Mubadala Investment Company.\nThis followed the January merger of Mubadala Development Company and\nInternational Petroleum Investment Company. He now has a business with $127bn of\nassets under management, a presence in 13 sectors and more than 30 countries and\n68,000 employees, and initial indications are positive. Mubadala made a net\nprofit of Dhs4.2bn ($1.14bn) in the first half of the year from a net loss of\nDhs4.7bn in the first half of 2016 and made a number of key announcements\nincluding the setting up of a venture capital arm. The San Francisco-based\noperation will also oversee a confirmed $15bn commitment to SoftBank\u2019s Vision\nfund confirmed earlier in the year through which 15-16 investments have already\nbeen made. Mubadala also said in November it would invest up to $1.2bn in French\nbusinesses under a deal signed with French investment vehicles CDC International\nCapital and Bpifrance.\n\n4. HE Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair\n\nCEO, Mashreq\n\n\n\nSector: Finance\n\nOverall rank: 10\n\nThe Al Ghurair family has had an unquestionable impact on the UAE\u2019s banking\ncommunity since the founding of Mashreq in 1967, with Abdul Aziz only growing\nthis perception in recent years as chairman of the UAE Banks Federation. Among\nhis main moves in 2017 were to direct Mashreq towards a more digital future,\nwith the launch of a digital banking platform and plans to shrink physical\nbranches in favour of online banking services over the next three years. Outside\nof the UAE\u2019s third largest lender, which posted a 12 per cent increase in profit\nfor the first nine months of 2017, Al Ghurair is also playing a major role in\nhis family\u2019s philanthropic efforts. The Abdullah Al Ghurair Foundation for\nEducation said in December it had provided 787 scholarships to Arab students\nless than two years after Al Ghurair\u2019s father pledged to donate a third of his\nwealth \u2013 or $1.1bn \u2013 to form the philanthropic organisation. Even with these\nefforts, the Al Ghurair family is still the second richest in the UAE, according\nto Forbes, with a net worth of $7.3bn in January 2018.\n\n5. HE Dr Sultan Al Jaber\n\nDirector general and CEO, ADNOC\n\n\n\nSector: Energy\n\nOverall rank: 11\n\nSultan Al Jaber has led a major shake-up of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company since\ntaking the reins in February 2016, with a focus on efficiency and consolidation\nin a period of low oil prices. An oil rally since then has given ADNOC some\nbreathing space but Al Jaber shows no sign of slowing down the firm\u2019s 2030\nstrategy to boost oil production and triple petrochemical output. Among the key\nmoves he oversaw in late 2017 was the initial public offering of the company\u2019s\nfuel distribution unit. The December listing was the first on the Abu Dhabi\nSecurities Exchange for six years and raised $851m. ADNOC also awarded\nengineering design contracts worth hundreds of millions of dirhams for the\nproduction of sour gas from its Hail, Ghasha and Dalma marine fields, while on\nthe renewable side of things the firm he previously led as CEO, Masdar, has gone\nfrom strength to strength with work progressing on major projects in Dubai,\nScotland, Oman and Sharjah.",

        "content": "Much is made about the role of talent in business. Terms such as, \u2018war for\ntalent\u2019 and \u2018talent management\u2019 have become popular buzzwords as companies\nattempt to evolve and grow during a tumultuous global economy.\n\nBut the role of talent in the Gulf is of particular importance, not just because\nthe Middle East has previously relied heavily on outside investment (especially\nwith regards to the workforce) but given the vast strides many countries in the\nregion have made towards development on a global scale.\n\nTo continue innovating at such a rate is a challenge in and of itself, but to do\nso without the next generation of leaders and innovators is nigh on impossible.\nFortunately, many individual businesses and governments in the Gulf have\nrealised that to evolve and grow, local talent must be developed, and have put\nin place processes and procedures to help a new generation of business leaders\nget started.\u00a0 But there are still huge challenges to be faced. Not all talent\ncomes pre-prepared with the skills to become successful \u2013 and chief among them\nis support.\n\nAccording to last year\u2019s Arab Youth Survey, there are three main factors that\nyoung Arabs deem necessary to develop. The most common response was \u201ca wide\nrange of work opportunities\u201d. In second place was \u201csafety and security\u201d,\nfollowed by \u201cgenerous salary packages\u201d. With living costs on the rise, each of\nthese factors is deeply affected by the role regional governments play in the\ndevelopment of young talent.\n\nFortunately, the region boasts more than a few government-backed programmes and\ninitiatives that aim to help companies helmed by young Arabs, as well as\nposition budding entrepreneurs in places they can gain experience.\n\nThe Emirates Foundation, for example, has been one of the largest contributing\nfactors to the UAE\u2019s current standing as the number one country most young Arabs\nwant to live in and emulate (according to the Arab Youth Survey).\n\n\u201cOver the last few years we have been very successful at developing programmes\nthat are tailored to respond to youth needs across the UAE,\u201d says Emirates\nFoundation CEO, Her Excellency Maytha Al Habsi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for many, many years now and I think the combination of\nempowering leadership and the love that we have as Emiratis for our country is\nthe reason we have been able to achieve so much.\u201d\n\nThe foundation focuses on a model that puts sustainability, collaboration and\nimpact at its core. It is spread across a huge variety of programmes (everything\nfrom volunteer disaster response to science fairs), but one of its more\nsuccessful initiatives has been the Ka\u2019afat Enterprise Journey, which aims to\nencourage more youth to join the private sector by helping them become \u2018job\nready\u2019.\n\nFuture leaders\n\nThe UAE appears to be leading the charge against those challenges. Foundations\nsuch as the country\u2019s Youth x Hub and Youth Circles aim to connect young leaders\ntogether to improve dialogue and discussion. The Federal Youth Authority helps\nposition future leaders within companies to help them develop. And the UAE Youth\nAmbassador Programme seeks to spread local Arab values within the private sector\nand international community.\n\nBut the most ambitious programme for youth development is surely the Youth\nGlobal Initiative, put in place by His Highness Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al\nNahyan, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed\nForces, late last year. It aims to enhance the Emirati youth\u2019s global role and\nintroduce the country\u2019s values and culture to the rest of the world.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the initiative, Sheikh Mohammad stressed that the\nyouth are the foundation of progress and development in all parts of UAE\nsociety.\n\n\u201cWe are in a non-stop race with the world, and we can achieve progress through\nour investment in two basic pillars: science, and national quality that will\nlead the country in the coming stages. These two are the strategic choice of the\nUAE and its bet to achieve what it longs to,\u201d the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince added.\n\nThe Youth Global Initiative aims to position the next generation of leaders\nwithin major international companies to gain that all-important experience. Part\nof the initiative will focus on empowering the UAE\u2019s youth towards the country\u2019s\nvision.\n\n\u201cWe are in a country that has a broad and well-founded foundation of young\npeople,\u201d added Sheikh Mohammad, \u201cwho are inspired by the principles and values\ninherited from the founding fathers and has become a genuine national approach\nin the service of our country and belonging to its land.\u201d\n\nSolving unemployment\n\nFor many young people, one of the most concerning factors is the stagnation of\nunemployment figures, which have remained almost the same for the past decade.\nAccording to Jihad Azour, director of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Middle\nEast and Central Asia Department (MCD), unemployment is alarmingly high in the\nregion.\n\n\u201cAlmost 60 per cent of the Middle East\u2019s population is under 30, and the level\nof unemployment at the youth level exceeds 30 per cent. This needs to be\naddressed,\u201d Azour told the Associated Press.\n\nWith so much unemployment, the key to resolving this issue lies with the private\nsector. However, with the IMF predicting just 1.3 per cent growth in the region\nin 2019, there needs to be urgent and radical change.\n\n\u201cWe need to accelerate reforms on the doing business side, reduce the\nimpediments to investment and access to finance,\u201d says Azour.\n\n\u201cAllow the private sector to be in the leading role and allow the state go from\nan operator to an enabler.\u201d\n\nOne government-backed initiative to tackle youth unemployment from the ground up\nis the Mohammed Bin Rashid Establishment for Young Business Leaders. According\nto Abdul Baset Al Janahi, CEO of Dubai SME the initiative \u201ccontributes towards\nachieving economic growth and the Dubai Plan 2021 by creating a supporting\nenvironment for youth innovations and entrepreneurial culture\u201d.\n\nIt does so by providing support across the public and private sector, including\nhanding out awards to business and entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cWe have provided consultancy services to more than 23,000 national\nentrepreneurs and supporting the establishment of 4,000 businesses since\ninception,\u201d explains Al Janahi, who praises \u201cthe vision of His Highness Sheikh\nMohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum in supporting the youth march towards\nentrepreneurship\u201d.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that entrepreneurial start-ups have their eyes on\nthe region, not least because in late March global ride-sharing company Uber\npaid $3.1bn to acquire its regional rival Careem. The news drew praise from the\nlikes Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who said: \u201cTwenty years\nago, we established an Internet and e-commerce city in Dubai\u2019s desert. Many\nquestioned the idea. Today, Uber acquired Careem for Dhs11bn. Recently, Amazon\nacquired Souq.com, also a multibillion-dirham deal. These companies emerged from\nthe \u2018deserts\u2019 of Dubai\u201d.\n\nBut the country has always been quick to support entrepreneurs. In March, Abu\nDhabi started a Dhs535m fund to support start-ups and venture capitalists. The\nGhadan Ventures Fund, which is managed by state-run Abu Dhabi Investment Office\n(ADIO), includes programmes that aim to attract fund managers to operate in the\nregion.\n\n\u201cWe are helping new venture capitalists establish in Abu Dhabi to ensure local\nstart-ups have access to more investors, while also driving the establishment\nand growth of start-ups,\u201d says Elham AlQassim, chief executive of ADIO.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurialism will be a key driver of Abu Dhabi\u2019s economy,\u201d she added.\n\nElsewhere in the Emirates, the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center (Sheraa) has\nannounced that it now has a 4,200-strong community of aspiring entrepreneurs\nacross 30 incubators and 15 accelerators.\n\n\u201cOur aim has always been to nurture and built a thriving entrepreneurship\necosystem for the UAE,\u201d says Najla Al Midfa, CEO of Sheraa.\n\nLate last year, it was announced that the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce would\npartner with Sheraa to boost local entrepreneurship even further. According to\nAl Midfa, \u201cthis helps us achieve our shared vision of creating a vibrant\nentrepreneurship ecosystem by providing entrepreneurs with the resources they\nneed to succeed\u201d.\n\nImproving skills\n\nWhile the UAE indeed looks attractive to younger talent, Saudi Arabia has taken\nmeasures to radically advance its initiatives towards getting its youth engaged\nand into work. Part of a wider 18-month initiative that saw the kingdom quickly\nopen up to outside investment, last year saw the launch of the Alliance for\nYouth. It\u2019s a programme based on a model created by Nestl\u00e9\u00a0Middle East, but has\nsince grown with partners such as Alawwal Bank, Ikea, Nielsen, Tamer Group and\nthe University of Business and Technology.\n\nThe aim is to bring together young people with like-minded companies, to improve\nskills across the kingdom.\n\n\u201cWe know from experience in other countries that concerted collective efforts\nthrough partnerships and collaboration amplify positive impact in society,\u201d says\nSamer Chedid, general manager at Nestl\u00e9 Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThis Alliance is set to further expedite efforts to prepare local youth for\nemployment in multinational, regional, and local companies, and provide more of\nthem with careers across the country,\u201d added Chedid. The Alliance is set to\nimpact more than 50,000 and employ 3,000 local Saudis by 2020.\n\nOf course, one of the Arab world\u2019s largest philanthropic education initiatives\nis the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education. The privately funded\nfoundation has pledged $1.1bn to support gifted youth across the region through\nKhalifa University, American University of Sharjah, American University of\nBeirut and American University in Cairo.\n\nAccording to Chief Executive Maysa Jalbout, the foundation has committed to\nimpacting the lives of 15,000 promising young Arabs in the fields of science,\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics.\n\n\u201cI believe education is the greatest equalizer and the surest path to overcoming\nthe region\u2019s biggest challenges,\u201d says Jalbout.\n\n\u201cTogether with our partners, we aim to enable the Foundation\u2019s beneficiaries to\ndevelop into empowered leaders in the UAE and across the region.\u201d\n\nIn the new Gulf economy, competition is global, and capital is abundant. In that\nkind of environment, talent becomes ever more important, which means the Middle\nEast needs to spend more time developing talented young people. Fortunately,\nthere are a large number of both private and public initiatives in place that\nhelp local talent evolve and grow.\n\nThanks to the foresight of many countries in the region \u2013 as well as\ncontributing private businesses and philanthropists \u2013 measures are in place to\nsafeguard that talent development and help a new generation of business leaders\nget started.",

        "content": "In the United Arab Emirates, the culture of giving is deeply ingrained in our\nnational identity. Some of my earliest memories are of my father taking me and\nmy brothers to meet communities that were living with a lot less. He would ask\ninsightful questions and listen to their needs, then offer support that promoted\ntheir agency and dignity. He always worked to empower the individuals to engage\nin their own solutions to break free from intergenerational poverty.\n\nEducation was always key to unlocking the potential for individuals to find\ntheir path to a better life for themselves and their families. So we, as a\nfamily, have been investing in education for generations through our charitable\nand philanthropic work.\n\nMy father understood that prosperity and progress depend on access to inclusive,\nhigh-quality education. With this conviction, he founded the Abdulla Al Ghurair\nFoundation and committed one-third of his personal wealth to support a dream\nwhere all young Arabs have an education and a chance at a better life.\n\nMy own approach to philanthropy is rooted in a generation that is more connected\nglobally and has greater needs. I approach philanthropy with the same passion\nand dedication as my father, but with more business strategy. This necessarily\nmeant being less quiet about giving, and cultivating a culture of good giving.\nIf my peers and I use strategy as the needle in our philanthropic compass, we\nwill be able to drive regional as well as global development and economic\ngrowth.\n\n\nPHILANTHROPY DRIVES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, our focus on humanitarian efforts has grown with\nthe nation\u2019s global presence. We view philanthropy as a core vehicle for\ndelivering results \u2013 especially around education and development for the most\nvulnerable. For me, strategic philanthropy is not charitable giving. It\u2019s\nconcerted investment in people, economies and societies. We share this planet\nwith billions of others, and caring for everyone is part of our traditions.\n\nI see enormous potential for philanthropy\u2019s role in helping to create jobs and\nstimulate economic growth. Philanthropy can play a critical role in ensuring\ninclusive growth, bringing along vulnerable groups of people that might be\nunintentionally overlooked or left behind.\n\nFinally, philanthropy has a convening role. The Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation\nbrought together expert partners who know how to deliver. That\u2019s why, when I\nestablished the Refugee Education Fund[1], I was strategic in bringing in the\nbest projects and talent \u2013 and it\u2019s why we partner with organisations like the\nGlobal Muslim Fund and UNICEF, the UN children\u2019s agency.\n\n\nFROM THE REGION, FOR THE REGION\n\nAt the core, I feel that we can attribute any success we have in our careers to\nour education. We are blessed, and why we need to do better by those who are\nstruggling.\n\nFor example, the protracted conflict in Syria \u2013 ongoing for more than an entire\ndecade \u2013 has severely worsened the region\u2019s education challenges. As recently as\na few years ago, 95% of Syrian refugees did not complete secondary education;\nand 95% of refugees do not have access to higher education. Meanwhile, child\nlabour and early marriage, the main reasons for dropping out of school, are on\nthe rise. This is alarming and will damage prospects for our region.\n\nOne of my philanthropic investments is in UNICEF\u2019s Makani centres[2] in Jordan,\na suite of informal learning centres where refugee children and young people can\ncatch up on learning. Recently, I met a young student, Hanan. Hanan has been\nparticipating in a Makani centre for three years. Her grades in science have\nsignificantly improved, which will set her on a path for success in a discipline\nwhere young women have traditionally been undervalued. But Hanan also excels in\nart and music \u2013 she showed me a painting that showed her take on education. For\nher, it\u2019s important her education helps her cultivate a sharp mind that can\nthink outside of the box, to push boundaries. A mind that is not only schooled\nfrom a textbook. I am inspired by her tenacity and grit, her determination to\novercome the odds stacked against her.\n\nHanan\u2019s drive and understanding \u2013 that a quality education is not simply\nmemorising curricula \u2013 is an important one, and one my fellow philanthropists\nshould keep in mind, particularly those of us who are from the region and have\nthe resources and expertise to contribute. With the right investments in their\nlearning and skills development, young refugees will become adults that\ncontribute economically to the societies that welcome them as students, workers,\ninnovators and entrepreneurs.\n\nOver the years, the Fund has managed to help over 60,000 vulnerable young\npeople. That\u2019s a small city. This is just the beginning of the story, because\nthese young people will graduate and enter the workforce. This is the kind of\ninvestment that yields dividends for a lifetime.\n\n\nTHE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL OF STRATEGIC PHILANTHROPY\n\nI differ from my father in one key approach to philanthropy \u2013 I decided we\nneeded to be more vocal about how we give and how these vulnerable communities\nneed our collective support.\n\nI believe in the potential of philanthropy to be a driving force for positive\nchange on a global scale, and in the importance of individuals and organisations\ngetting involved in philanthropic efforts and considering the long-term impact\nof their giving.\n\nUNICEF recognised the impact of my strategic approach to philanthropy, and of\nthe work we are doing, and invited me to join UNICEF\u2019s International Council \u2013 a\ncollective of over 120 philanthropists committed to improving children\u2019s lives\nto deliver impact at scale.\n\nUNICEF is a trusted organisation. In our connected world, our giving needs to be\nconnected. Through the Council, members like myself, leverage our wealth beyond\njust giving funds. We share our knowledge, influence, networks and identify\nopportunities for joint investments. We strategise.\n\nToday, there is an opportunity to make strong investments in the next\ngeneration. Strategic philanthropy is a force multiplier in moving that goal\nforward. In pushing for solutions. In finding better partners and having a\npositive and lasting impact, because children are worth our best efforts.",

Image\nCredit: AP\n\nDubai: In response to the urgent needs faced by Palestinian students abroad,\nparticularly those from Gaza, the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation (AGF) today\nannounced the launch of its Education Relief Fund. The initiative aims to\nprovide financial assistance to students pursuing medicine, health sciences, and\nSTEM fields at universities outside their homeland and whose education has been\ndisrupted by the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\nUntil recently, these students were supported by their families, with all\neducational expenses paid for, never anticipating that they would face such\nhardship. However, the recent conflict has severely impacted their ability to\ncontinue their education without assistance.\n\n\nGET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT WITH GULF NEWS WHATSAPP CHANNEL\n\n\n\nThe Education Relief Fund aims to provide grants that will cover tuition fees,\nliving expenses, and other essential costs for students nearing graduation,\nfacilitating their timely completion of studies amidst escalating conflict. The\nprogramme targets Gazan and West Bank students in their final year of study or\nrequired training, who are studying abroad.\n\nAGF has pledged to support 900 students to complete their university education,\nrecognising the urgent need to address the acute educational disruptions caused\nby the conflict. The programme is implemented in collaboration with United\nLebanon Youth Project (ULYP), a trusted partner offering comprehensive support\nto marginalised communities through educational initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing conflict in Gaza has placed immense hardship on its population,\nincluding in education,\u201d said Sonia Ben Jaafar, CEO of AGF. \u201cThrough the\nEducation Relief Fund, we aim to mitigate some of these challenges for students\nwho are nearly completing their higher education. This fund is not only a\nlifeline to safeguard their future opportunities, but also contributes to\nstrengthening the healthcare workforce essential for the region\u2019s recovery.\u201d\n\nTogether, AGF and ULYP are dedicated to a transparent and accountable\ndistribution of the funds, ensuring the support extend beyond financial\nassistance. This initiative is a crucial step towards empowering these students\nto overcome current adversities and emerge as key contributors in driving\npositive change within their communities.",

        "content": "In our pursuit of transforming the future of education, we must confront the\nstark reality of global youth unrest. Recent events in countries like France\nhave highlighted the deep divisions and fragmentation faced by young adults. The\nunfortunately frequent instances of youth responding to violence with violence,\nmirror their profound frustration and yearning for change.\n\nThis surge of unrest is not exclusive to France \u2013 it is a global trend. The\ntragic deaths of individuals like Nahel in France, George Floyd in the United\nStates and Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, to name just a few instances, have\nignited worldwide reactions, sparking movements that demand justice and equality\nfrom those who feel unheard and unseen.\n\nIn the face of these issues, higher education institutions \u2013 colleges and\nuniversities \u2013 have a unique and critical role to play. These places are not\nmere centres of learning but potent catalysts for transformation. Education\ntoday must provide young adults with the necessary knowledge, skills, and\ncritical thinking abilities to engage in constructive dialogue and tackle\ncomplex problems.\n\nTo effectively drive positive change, higher education must foster inclusive\nenvironments that value diversity and create spaces where all voices are heard\nand respected. Too many young adults feel overlooked and anxious about the\nfuture.\n\nThese tragic events in different parts of the world have laid bare the systemic\nissues that afflict our societies. They have kindled a fire in the hearts of\nyoung people, inspiring them to seek solutions and demand change.\n\nThis is a generation that refuses to be silenced; a generation ready to\nchallenge the status quo and fight for a brighter future. Leaders in all sectors\nmust support them in finding their voice and the opportunities to fulfil their\npurpose responsibly.\n\nAs we process the news and share in the collective anger and pain, we know that\nviolent responses are merely expressions of the frustration and anger felt by\nthose who feel they have no other way to voice their grievances.\n\nYet any transformation will not stem from conference room conversations and\nauditorium speeches. It will need a recognition of the overlooked potential of\neducation and employment, especially among the growing young population. It will\ncome when we challenge the quiet acceptance of chronic obstacles in education\nand embrace greater diversity and inclusion among higher education leadership.\n\nHigher education institutions must up their game and focus on practical\nsolutions if they are to serve as the foundation for the leaders of today and\ntomorrow to engage in resilient, inclusive and forward-thinking innovations that\ncultivate peace, security, and sustainable development.\n\nWhen these institutions foster an environment that not only educates but also\nempowers students to address societal issues, they cultivate leaders who make\nthemselves and their communities resistant to recruitment tactics for\nradicalisation and violence.\n\nHigher education has always aimed to equip students with the tools to dissect\nand understand complex problems, foster critical thinking and facilitate open\ndialogue. The world\u2019s leading institutions empower students to become active\ncontributors in their communities, promoting civic engagement and human rights.\n\nThis is most effective when there is a genuine, deep connection between the\ntheoretical aspects of higher education and the realities of the non-academic\nsetting \u2013 the world of work and growth opportunities surrounding these eager\nyoung minds.\n\nThe World Bank has highlighted youth unemployment in Arab states and its\npotential radicalisation implications. Universities and colleges can counteract\nthis by prioritising practical skills aligned with job market demands, moving\nbeyond purely academic teachings.\n\nDiscussions like those at the United Nations Transforming Education Summit in\nSeptember 2022 are important but need to result in concrete actions.\n\nOne such action is the work of the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation, partnering\nwith 24 universities as part of their outreach to provide 200,000 Arab youth\nwith accessible professional learning for high-demand jobs.\n\nAs part of this effort, the foundation leverages participatory design methods to\npromote wider offerings of professional graduate diplomas that have employment\noutcomes for these youth. One such approach is in artificial intelligence and\ndata science from the American University of Beirut, which includes regionally\nrelevant applications and the integration of ethics as a core component, with\nconnections to real market opportunities.\n\nWe must fervently engage with our youth, especially those who may feel sidelined\nor despondent, ensuring they feel embraced and empowered. Diversity is the key\nto understanding and connecting with the lived reality of those who were not\nborn with privilege.\n\nTo truly transform higher education, we need practical leadership in higher\neducation that empathises with the passion of youth who are grappling with\nextreme climates, high unemployment and profound disenchantment.\n\nBy nurturing inclusive environments that equip them with the tools and market\npractice to navigate real-world challenges, we can empower the youth to become\npositive agents of change and progress.\n\nIf we want to see real change, we must be willing to challenge existing norms\nwithin these institutions and break down some longstanding barriers to higher\neducation.\n\nIf we don\u2019t, we risk seeing further outbursts of anger and violence from a\ndisappointed segment of society, ultimately causing harm to both themselves and\nthe world around them.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily\nreflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

The consultancy market in particular, experienced a\nreturn to growth in 2021, with KSA and the UAE seeing the most activity.\n\nThe need for advisory and transaction services grew across all industries, most\nnotably in cybersecurity, TMT, and the public sector, as organisations looked to\nimplement digital transformations while managing risk. With countries across the\nGCC slowly emerging from lockdown procedures at the end of 2020, the demand for\nstrategy support in the entertainment and leisure sector increased in 2021.\n\nGovernments helped ease the transition back to public engagements with events\nsuch as EXPO 2020 in the UAE and the Formula 1 race in KSA. Overall, there has\nbeen a noticeable shift in approach from short-term planning back to medium and\nlong-term planning. We are still in the midst of 2022, but barring any global or\nregional shake-ups, it can be expected that the momentum will continue until the\nend of the year.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE INDUSTRY AND ITS CLIENTS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD?\n\nFor our clients across consultancy, strategy and transactions, tax, and\nassurance, the focus will remain on accelerating digitisation and innovation as\nwell as launching new transformation programs. In addition, as governments look\nto streamline their processes while also integrating global standards, we will\nsee an increased effort in aligning compliance solutions \u2013 particularly in the\nfinancial services sector.\n\nClients are also making a concerted effort to implement ESG practices within\ntheir organisations and track nonfinancial metrics. At the moment, most\ncompanies in the region are measuring impact to add value as that compliance\nrequirements are still minimal.

        "content": "UAE nationals occupy the most number of spots on Gulf Business\u2018 annual list of\nthe Top 100 Most Powerful Arabs in 2017.\n\nThose on the list from the UAE span across industries \u2013 from real estate and\nfinance to energy.\n\nIn total, 37 of the most powerful Arabs originate from the UAE. Here are the top\nfive \u2013\n\n1. Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum\n\nChairman, Emirates/Emirates NBD\n\nSector: Diversified\n\nOverall rank: 2\n\nIt was a difficult year for some of the organisations under the watchful eye of\nSheikh Ahmed. Currency issues, competition and economic uncertainty resulted in\nDubai carrier Emirates posting a 75 per cent drop in first half net profit in\nNovember, while the slowing economy saw an end to 16 straight quarters of profit\nincreases at Emirates NBD in Q3. But the Dubai royal still finished the year\nwith plenty to smile about. Passenger traffic at Dubai International Airport was\nup 7.2 per cent in 2016 to 83.6 million and the chairman of some of Dubai\u2019s\nlargest government vehicles including the Dubai Expo 2020 Higher Committee, told\nGulf Business in June that he was optimistic about the opportunities the mega\nevent would bring as it draws ever closer.\n\n2. Mohamed Alabbar\n\nChairman, Emaar\n\n\n\nSector: Real estate\n\nOverall rank: 8\n\nIn 2016, Alabbar went from UAE real estate heavyweight at the head of Emaar and\nEagle Hills to a big name in food and e-commerce after several acquisitions. He\nstarted the year by announcing a new landmark tower project in Dubai designed to\nbe taller than Emaar\u2019s Burj Khalifa as part of the Creek Harbour development and\nlater caught headlines with a number of interesting acquisitions. These included\na $138.6m joint venture with fashion retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter, the $2.35bn\nacquisition of Kuwait\u2019s Americana by his Adeptio investment firm and the\npurchase of a minority stake in logistics company Aramex as part of an\ninvestment group. The trusted advisor to Dubai\u2019s ruler Sheikh Mohammed, also\ntook the time to announce $1bn e-commerce venture Noon.com in partnership with\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund and could be making more big moves in 2017\nwith a messaging app rival to WhatsApp said to be in the works.\n\n3. Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak\n\nCEO, Mubadala Investment\n\n\n\nSector: Diversified\n\nOverall rank: 9\n\nIt has certainly been an eventful 12 months for Al Mubarak, a prolific\nbusinessman and trusted advisor to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Zayed\nAl Nahyan. Since our previous list his sovereign investment vehicle has made a\nnumber of interesting investments, including a 20 per cent stake in\nBahrain-based alternative investment firm Investcorp, and was also linked to\nJapanese telecom giant SoftBank\u2019s $100bn technology fund in January. But, As\ncommodity prices continued to weigh on Mubadala Development\u2019s financial results,\nthe most interesting move was news of the company\u2019s merger with sister firm\nInternational Petroleum Investment Co. Now complete, the combination has created\na fund with combined assets worth around $125bn and Al Mubarak is sat right at\nthe helm.\n\n4. Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair\n\nCEO, Mashreq\n\n\n\nSector: Finance\n\nOverall rank: 10\n\nThe drop in oil prices and resultant impact on the UAE\u2019s economy has meant\ntesting times in the country\u2019s banking industry but Al Ghurair has emerged as a\nrare voice of reassurance in the gloom. As the head of the bank founded by his\nfather during the oil boom in 1967 and chairman of the UAE Banks Federation he\nwas one of the most high profile figures lobbying the government to introduce\ninsolvency regulation, even going as far as creating a joint industry rescue\ninitiative to help SMEs restructure their debt in March last year before the new\nlaw was announced. Unfortunately though, conditions still weighed on Mashreq\u2019s\nfinancial results, with profit down 24.8 per cent in Q3 to $112.98m. Separately\nAl Ghurair also made headlines with the launch of his father\u2019s $1.1bn Abdulla Al\nGhurair Foundation for Education for which he announced a number of initiatives\nwith the world\u2019s top universities as the year went on.\n\n5. Mohammad Al Gergawi\n\nChairman, Dubai Holding*\n\n\n\nSector: Diversified\n\nOverall rank: 11\n\nAl Gergawi is one of the most influential figures in Dubai and the UAE as\nchairman of Dubai Holding, minister of cabinet affairs and future and chairman\nof the executive office of the Dubai Government. In the last year he has played\na key role in some of Dubai\u2019s biggest projects including the Dhs1bn ($272m)\nBusiness Bay Canal, opened in November, and the new $20bn Jumeirah Central\nmaster development, which will take the previous Mall of the World site on\nSheikh Zayed Road. In his position at Dubai Holding he also oversees some of the\nemirate\u2019s most well known entities including TECOM Group, Jumeirah Group, Dubai\nProperties, Dubai Group and Dubai International Capital.\n\n(*Editor\u2019s Note: This week, it was announced that Mohammed Al Gergawi has\nresigned from his role as chairman of Dubai Holding.

Inzerillo\nDESIGNATION: Group CEO\nCOMPANY: Diriyah Gate Development Authority (DGDA)\nINDUSTRY: Tourism\n\nJerry Inzerillo is a globally celebrated visionary leader with a five-decade\ncareer in tourism and hospitality. He has been a champion for the sector and the\npeople at its heart. In recognition of his dedication to the hospitality\nindustry, he was awarded the prestigious HOTELS magazine \u201cCorporate Hotelier of\nthe World Award\u201d and the \u201cTourism for Peace Award\u201d by WANGO.\n\nMore recently, President Joe Biden awarded Inzerillo the Presidential Volunteer\nService Award and is the recipient of the Nelson Mandela Children\u2019s Fund\nLifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn June 2018, Inzerillo was appointed by HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al\nSaud to be the founding CEO of the Diriyah Gate Development Authority (now\nDiriyah Company). The $63.2 billion project aims to develop the\n14-square-kilometer area, encompassing world-class cultural, entertainment,\nretail, hospitality, educational, religious, office and residential assets, with\nthe UNESCO World Heritage Site of At-Turaif as its anchor.\n\nIn this role, Inzerillo is tasked with developing and implementing the master\nplan to turn Diriyah into one of the world\u2019s greatest gathering places,\nrestoring and reimagining the birthplace of the Kingdom.\n\nTHE YEAR 2022\n\nAccording to Inzerillo, 2022 was one of the most exciting years of this\nproject\u2019s lifetime, with Diriyah becoming one of the first giga projects to open\nassets: Bujairi Terrace, the world\u2019s latest premier cuisine offering, and\nAt-Turaif, the majestic UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nDiriyah, The City of Earth, has always been a convergence point for culture,\ncelebrating its heritage through modern art exhibitions and showcasing local\ndesigners and talent. In Diriyah, we celebrate our culture in everything we do,\nbecause our culture is our identity.\n\nROADMAP\n\nInzerillo reveals that he has always approached challenges in two ways: first,\nbuilding an excellent team, and second, meticulous planning. When Crown Prince\nMohammed bin Salman asked him to lead the Diriyah Gate Development Authority,\nhis first task was to build a best-in-class team. Given the scale and complexity\nof the Diriyah development, meticulous planning is essential to delivering our\ngoals and mitigating potential risks.\n\n\u201cAssess, action, manage, three words to live by when managing a project like\nthis,\u201d says Inzerillo.\n\nSustainability is at the heart of Diriyah. The Company has enrolled in KSA\u2019s own\nsustainability certification program, MOSTADAM, and has been awarded the\nplatinum-level USGBC LEED pre-certification, first of its kind in the Middle\nEast.\n\nProtecting the natural environment and the way of life that has existed here for\ncenturies is fundamental. Our approach must therefore be holistic \u2013 conserving,\nenhancing, and celebrating the community and environment. The first phase of the\nDiriyah masterplan, for example, will be built entirely in the traditional Najdi\narchitectural style, a defining part of Diriyah\u2019s identity and culture.\n\n\u201cGiven its profound historical roots and strong connection to the Kingdom, our\nwork is centred on crafting a sustainable project while preserving the identity\nand natural environment of this exceptional place,\u201d concludes Inzerillo.\n\nRANK: 02\nNAME: Amin Nasser\nDESIGNATION: President and CEO\nCOMPANY: Saudi Aramco\nINDUSTRY: Energy\n\nIn his current position at Aramco, a prominent integrated energy and chemicals\ncompany, and a significant global provider of crude oil, Nasser also serves as a\nmember of the company\u2019s board of directors.

He particularly champions the advancement\nand development of Saudi youth and strongly supports the Young Leader\u2019s Advisory\nBoard (YLAB), which facilitates a connection between Saudi Aramco leadership and\nthe perspectives of young professionals.\n\nAt the same time, Nasser is leading the way in driving Saudi Aramco\u2019s efforts\ntowards generating cleaner energy and products. These endeavours encompass\nstrategic investments in promising technologies, including next-generation\nfuel-engine interfaces, processes that convert crude oil into chemicals,\napplications for renewable energy, and the support of emerging startups\ndedicated to offering cleaner energy solutions.\n\nHis involvement extends to broader industry initiatives focused on reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions, notably his participation in the Oil and Gas Climate\nInitiative (OGCI). This underscores his commitment to addressing environmental\nconcerns at a larger scale through collaborative efforts within the energy\nsector.\n\nFurthermore, Nasser champions the establishment of an efficient and easily\naccessible supply chain ecosystem. This ecosystem is designed to accommodate the\nevolving procurement needs of Saudi Aramco. Notably, his emphasis on inclusivity\nsees the active involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),\ncontributing to the growth and sustainability of the supply chain network.\n\nHis vision aligns with ensuring that the procurement processes are streamlined,\nresponsive, and capable of meeting Saudi Aramco\u2019s expanding requirements while\nfostering an environment of collaboration and mutual benefit among various\nbusiness entities.\n\nIn addition to his corporate roles, Nasser occupies positions in various\nadvisory boards and councils. These include the International Advisory Board of\nthe King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, the Board of Trustees of the\nKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology, the World Economic Forum\u2019s\nInternational Business Council (IBC), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nPresidential CEO Advisory Board, the JP Morgan International Council, and the\nBlackRock Board of Directors.\n\nHis involvement in these advisory boards and councils showcases his active\nengagement in diverse institutions while his participation underscores his\ncommitment to fostering knowledge, technology, and global economic discussions.\nThese roles reflect Nasser\u2019s dedication to promoting innovation, education, and\nstrategic decision-making across different sectors, strengthening his position\nas a thought leader and influencer in energy, technology, as well as in finance.\n\nRANK: 03\nNAME: Mohamed Alabbar\nDESIGNATION: Founder and Chairman\nCOMPANY: Emaar and noon\nINDUSTRY: Real estate\n\nDriven by the resolute ambition to contribute to Dubai\u2019s visionary pursuit of\nbecoming one of the most modern and advanced cities globally, Alabbar laid the\nfoundation of Emaar in Dubai on 16 June 1997.

Additionally, Alabbar holds a\nstake in the globally acclaimed online fashion retailer, Yoox Net-a-Porter\nGroup, through his Alabbar Enterprises.\n\nA testament to his indomitable spirit, Alabbar\u2019s journey has also unfolded in\nthe hospitality sphere through Emaar Hospitality Group which has aimed to\nestablish homegrown brands that rival the finest international counterparts.\n\nToday, the group stands as a testament to his dedication, boasting key\nhospitality assets that include Address Hotels + Resorts, Armani Hotels and\nResorts, Vida Hotels and Resorts, along with serviced residences, leisure clubs,\nand an array of restaurants and spas.\n\nEmaar Properties made a significant commitment to embed ESG principles and\nvalues into its operational fabric and investment strategies\n\n\nEMAAR\u2019S NEW PROJECT\n\nIn June 2023, Emaar unveiled a new luxury waterfront property development with a\ntotal investment of $20 billion. The project, named \u2018The Oasis by Emaar,\u2019 is set\nto encompass 7,000 residential units, comprising both mansions and villas.\n\nThe ultra-luxury waterfront master community in Dubai with four- and\nfive-bedroom stand-alone villas, a significant portion of the land,\napproximately one-quarter, will be devoted to enhancing the natural\nsurroundings.\n\nThis includes the creation of lakes, water canals, expansive parks, jogging\ntracks, and lush green spaces. Moreover, the development will incorporate an\narray of opulent amenities to cater to a luxurious lifestyle.\n\nEMAAR PROPERTIES ROBUST PERFORMANCE\n\nDriven by the surge in tourism, strong retail sales, and a continuous demand for\nreal estate in Dubai, Emaar Properties has revealed robust revenues of $3.3\nbillion for the initial half of 2023. In tandem, the company achieved remarkable\ngroup property sales amounting to $5.5 billion, marking a noteworthy\nyear-on-year growth of 14 percent.\n\nFurthermore, the net profit exhibited a substantial increase of 15 percent\ncompared to the same period in the previous year, reaching $1.3 billion. An\nencouraging sign of Emaar\u2019s promising future, its revenue backlog surged to\n$17.1 billion as of 30 June 2023.\n\nThis backlog represents the forthcoming revenue generated from property sales,\nwhich will be gradually recognised over the upcoming years. This prudent\napproach to accumulating future revenue underscores Emaar\u2019s commitment to\nsustainable growth and financial resilience.\n\nA CULTURE OF CSR\n\nEmaar Properties has cultivated a culture of CSR since 2004, initially focusing\non providing support to welfare groups within UAE communities. Steered by\nAlabbar, a series of initiatives as integral components of Emaar\u2019s CSR programme\nwere suggested and over time, this outreach has extended beyond the borders of\nthe UAE, encompassing a diverse range of countries and categories.\n\nSandooq Al Watan is a noteworthy social initiative championed by a group of\nEmirati businessmen with the aim of fostering sustainable development, a\ndignified life, and a promising future for the entire nation. This demonstrates\nEmaar\u2019s unwavering dedication to its corporate and social responsibilities as a\npioneering figure within the community.\n\nAligned with the Egyptian government\u2019s directives to provide support to\nlow-income individuals, Emaar Misr introduced Beyout Al Kheir in 2018.

This\ncommitment is underscored by a three-fold strategy. The first pillar is\ndedicated to decarbonising the company\u2019s real estate assets, closely monitoring\nemissions to align with global targets.\n\nThe second pillar focuses on the resilience of assets in relation to\nclimate-induced physical hazards and transitional risks originating from market\ndynamics and energy transition.\n\nLastly, the third pillar centres on cultivating the foundations of a progressive\nsociety by providing support to Emaar\u2019s employees and the communities in which\nthe company operates.\n\nConcurrently, Emaar supports micro-loan projects aimed at fostering sustainable\ndevelopment. In a bid to champion sustainable and environmentally friendly\nlogistics practices, and as a component of their fleet expansion, noon Food\nintroduced electric bikes to its Dubai fleet in May 2023. E-bikes have gained\npopularity within the city, with the food delivery sector also embracing this\nmode of transportation.\n\nSince these bikes do not release pollutants, this initiative is in alignment\nwith the UAE\u2019s ambitious target of achieving zero emissions by 2050. The\nadoption of such a sustainable transportation solution also offers partners of\nnoon Food a cost-effective alternative to conventional gas-powered scooters.\n\nRANK: 04\nNAME: Shaji Ul Mulk\nDESIGNATION: Founder and Chairman\nCOMPANY: Mulk International Group\nINDUSTRY: Industry\n\nEstablished in 1982, Mulk International Group is a 40-year-old global entity\nwith a diversified portfolio spanning primarily four sectors: manufacturing of\nmetal composite panels and LGS homes, real estate, sports assets, and\nhealthcare.

His journey commenced in the\nearly 90s with his move to the UAE, driven by the aspiration to build his own\nbusiness. In 1993, that dream became reality with the inception of Danube Group\nwhich began as a small trading enterprise focusing on building materials.\n\nTHE ONE PERCENT GENIUS\n\nWhen Sajan ventured into the property sector, he encountered a landscape already\npopulated by significant players. He recognised the need for a distinctive\napproach in the real estate realm and realised that a substantial 80 to 90\npercent of expatriates in Dubai were inclined towards renting.\n\nSajan\u2019s vision was to convert these renters into property buyers, a concept he\ntermed as the \u2018one percent payment plan.\u2019 This approach entailed a modest down\npayment coupled with a monthly payment set at just one percent with the\nremaining balance collected upon the building\u2019s completion.\n\nAs the building progressed to 60 percent completion, banks were willing to\nfinance the remaining 40 percent of the property\u2019s cost, even prior to the title\ndeed transfer. This approach eliminated the need for customers to engage\ndirectly with banks, bypassing prolonged approval processes and the\nuncertainties associated with interest rates. The one percent plan ultimately\nemerged as the foundational principle that shaped Danube Properties and fuelled\nits subsequent success.\n\nEXPANSION\n\nIn terms of expansion in 2022, Sajan explains, \u201cThe year not only helped us make\nup for the losses during the COVID-19 pandemic but also helped us to grow\nbusiness in new areas and expand to new territories. We have witnessed\nsubstantial growth in gross revenue and have hired more professionals to manage\nour growth.

He adds, \u201cDespite the\nglobal problems, Dubai managed to attract a large pool of international\ninvestors who came here as visitors, loved the infrastructure, quality of life,\nglobal connectivity, and the vibrancy and resilience of the UAE economy, and\ndecided to open a branch of their business and bought a home. Some are\nrelocating their entire business here due to safety, security, and the ease of\ndoing business. Due to this, demand for quality homes has gone up and we, among\nothers, are benefitting from this.\u201d\n\nRANK: 20\nNAME: Abdul Aziz al Ghurair\nDESIGNATION: Chairman\nCOMPANY: Al Ghurair Investment\nINDUSTRY: Investment\n\nIn addition to his current role, Al Ghurair also holds the directorship of the\nAbdullah Al Ghurair Group of Companies, a business legacy with a presence in\nover 20 countries and over 50 years of history.

This\nupbringing instilled in him the core values of perseverance and hard work, which\neventually paved the way for his mastery in attracting investments and launching\nsuccessful ventures. Drawing from the lessons learned during those challenging\ntimes, Reinhardt transformed into an adept professional capable of navigating\nthe intricacies of securing investments and starting new enterprises.\n\nVENTURES BACKED BY A MISSION\n\nEach startup fostered by Reinhardt carries a profound mission, a mission to\nreshape the world and elevate the well-being of everyday individuals.

Built upon the bedrock of Delegated\nProof-of-Stake (DPoS), the Smart Blockchain framework embraces an exceedingly\nenergy-frugal mechanism, effectively curbing its ecological impact in a\nsubstantial manner.\n\nIn stark contrast to the resource-intensive nature of traditional blockchain\nmodels, Smart Blockchain\u2019s innovative approach underscores its commitment to\nsustainability and ecological equilibrium. Its adoption of the DPoS protocol,\ncharacterised by its judicious allocation of network validation responsibilities\nto a select group of participants, not only ensures the expeditious validation\nof transactions but also upholds its dedication to minimising energy\nexpenditure.\n\nThis is underscored by the technology\u2019s capacity to process transactions and\nmaintain the integrity of the blockchain while concurrently abiding by\nenvironmentally sound principles. Also, through its pioneering employment of\nDPoS, it not only demonstrates the viability of eco-friendly alternatives in the\nblockchain domain but also sets a compelling precedent for future technological\ndevelopments that resonate with the ethos of a greener tomorrow.\n\nNAVIGATING CHALLENGES AND FORGING AHEAD\n\nAccording to Reinhardt, in the year 2022, the blockchain industry persisted in\nits growth trajectory despite the setbacks of bankruptcies and regulatory gaps.\nHe adds, \u201cIn response to the mounting mistrust within the industry, we unveiled\na visionary solution, namely the Smart Blockchain.\u201d Rallying his team, they\nembarked on an unrelenting mission to create a remedy anchored in transparency,\nsecurity, and stringent regulations. The culmination of their tireless efforts\nmaterialised in 2023, as Smart Blockchain emerged onto the scene, not only\nsetting new benchmarks but also rejuvenating confidence within the sector.\n\nReinhardt reveals that the Smart Blockchain presents itself as a dynamic and\nadaptable blockchain platform, bestowing users with the remarkable capability to\nseamlessly establish decentralised networks and proprietary tokens. \u201cThe\nelegance of its design extends further, enabling the effortless integration of\nthese elements into pre-existing products, revolutionising the synergy between\ntechnology and innovation,\u201d he says.\n\nCREATING AWARENESS ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN\n\nNevertheless, the resurgence of trust within the realm of blockchain transcends\nthe boundaries of technological innovation alone. In order to authentically\nrestore faith, it becomes imperative to comprehensively educate individuals\nabout the underlying principles that constitute the bedrock of blockchain\ntechnology. Acknowledging this pivotal aspect, the Smart Blockchain initiative\nspearheaded by Reinhardt and his dedicated team aspires not only to redefine the\nparameters of technological progress, but also to illuminate users about the\nexpansive and transformative potential that blockchain holds.\n\nMoving from the trials and tribulations of the year 2022 to the dawn of the\nSmart Blockchain era in 2023, the journey, in Reinhardt\u2019s words, \u201cStands as a\ntestament to the remarkable ingenuity and unwavering determination of the human\nspirit.\u201d The narrative artfully portrays how challenges, often perceived as\nstumbling blocks, possess the remarkable ability to serve as springboards for\nground-breaking ideas.\n\nMoreover, it eloquently showcases how teams fortified with determination and\nresilience can orchestrate paradigm shifts within industries by resolutely\ntackling obstacles head-on. Within the tapestry of the Smart Blockchain\u2019s\nevolution, a luminescent thread of progress is interwoven, symbolising the\nlimitless capacities of technology to introduce far-reaching and positive\ntransformations, thereby rekindling trust amidst the nebulous backdrop of\nuncertainty.\n\nRANK: 40\nNAME: Yasser Abdul Malak\nDESIGNATION: Chairman and CEO\nCOMPANY: Nestl\u00e9 MENA\nINDUSTRY: Industry\n\nAppointed to his current role on 1 January 2022, Abdul Malak has over two\ndecades of experience with Nestl\u00e9 where he has held multiple senior leadership\npositions across key regions.\n\nPreviously, he was appointed as the CEO in Nestl\u00e9 Turkey from April 2021 to\nJanuary 2022 where he delivered robust results and helmed expansion projects\nthat led to the company\u2019s growth in the country.\n\nOver the years, he has held several leadership positions at Nestl\u00e9, including\nthe CEO for Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Northeast Africa region based in Egypt until he was\nassigned the role of Dairy Category Head Zone Europe Middle East and North\nAfrica in 2018 at the Nestl\u00e9 headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland.\n\nNestl\u00e9 operates 24 food and beverage factories across the 19 countries of the\nMENA region; and provides direct employment to over 15,000 people.\n\nAbdul Malak embarked on his career trajectory with Nestl\u00e9 in KSA in 1999.\nFollowing his first assignment, he moved to their regional head office to helm\nthe MAGGI business as the senior brand manager until mid-2003.
