        "content": "Grand Prix racing's key stakeholders have begun discussions to frame the next\nConcorde Agreement, the document by which F1 is run, that is set to cover the\nperiod 2026 to 2030.\n\nHistory has shown that the Concorde discussions are often extremely fraught, as\nteams vie for greater commercial rights income from the promoter as well as over\nother teams.\n\nWhen Ecclestone was F1 supremo he often pitched teams against each other \u2013\nknowing that the negotiating hand of the competitors was much weaker if he could\npick them off as individuals rather than give them power as a group.\n\nIt was through enticing teams with extra secret bonuses to play them off each\nother, for example, that he helped accelerate the demise of the Formula One\nTeams\u2019 Association more than a decade ago.\n\nGreg Maffei, CEO of the Liberty Media company that owns F1, says such divide and\nconquer tactics will not be employed this time around \u2013 even though he expects\nsome fraught negotiations over some aspects of the next Concorde Agreement.\n\nAutosport has already revealed, for example, that one controversial aspect of\nConcordes of the past, an extra historic bonus that Ferrari gets, is to remain.\nHowever, it will be capped \u2013 something which is understood not to have delighted\nthe Italian squad.\n\nSpeaking at an F1 in Depth event in Monaco, which was co-hosted by Autosport\nBusiness, Maffei pointed to the approach of the next Concorde Agreement\ndiscussions being a world away from how they were in the past.\n\n\u201cThe prior regime really did put a lot of time in having the teams compete\nagainst each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many cases, they enjoyed just getting an edge\non each other, rather than thinking about how to grow the sport.\n\n\u201cWe've tried to take really a page out of, I'd say in some ways, the NFL in the\nUnited States: compete hard on Sunday, but on Monday league first.\n\n\u201cWe really want to grow the sport together. The teams have embraced that, and\nprofited from that, because they've not only seen the growth in F1 revenues and\ntheir share of the profits in their own sponsorship, but we\u2019ve also seen growth\nin the value of teams.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaffei went on to cite the fact that the commercial boom that F1 has enjoyed\nover recent years, allied to the positive impact of the cost cap, means that the\nhealth of the grid has never been as strong as it is now.\n\n\u201cWhen we got involved in late 2016, and we made our first investment close in\nJanuary 2017, the bottom teams were literally worthless,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cManor had been sold for one pound the prior summer. And now there isn't a team\nthat's worth less than a billion dollars, maybe more, and they raise money at\nthose numbers.\n\n\u201cWe've seen enormous growth in the value of the teams, just as we've seen growth\nin the value of F1. But actually, the teams' values have probably increased\nmore. And that was important: we needed to have a mentality of investment and\nmentality that these were franchises that they could really have true value. And\ntoday that's happened.\u201d\n\nBut equally, with the Concorde Agreement being such an important document for\nteams\u2019 long-term financial security, Maffei says he is not naive enough to\nbelieve that discussions will be a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cThere are surely issues we're going to fight over. [And] what a surprise: they\nwould like to make more money. I don't begrudge them that.\n\n\u201cI suspect some of that, they wish, might come out of our pocket. But in\ngeneral, they appreciate we've tried to take the long view, and we try to take\nthe view that we should all profit together.\u201d\n\nWatch: F1 2024 Monaco GP Review \u2013 Leclerc Finally Breaks the Curse",

He helped build the series into the worldwide\nspectacle it has become, but in his later years he was seen by many as holding\nit back because of his autocratic style and slow pace of innovation.\n\nIn 2014, he faced criminal bribery charges in a German court in relation to a\npayment to a banker who approved the sale of Formula 1 to a private equity firm.\nBut he escaped with a $100 million fine in a deal that was widely criticized. In\n2008, he paid 10 million pounds to settle a British tax case.\n\nIn addition to his legal troubles, Mr. Ecclestone has found himself repeatedly\nin the news for his divisive comments. He drew condemnation in 2009 after an\ninterview in which he said that Hitler had been an effective leader and\nquestioned whether democracy was right for Britain. He later apologized for the\nremarks.\n\nAfter the invasion of Ukraine, he called President Vladimir Putin of Russia a\n\u201cfirst class\u201d person whom he would \u201ctake a bullet for.\u201d During the Black Lives\nMatter protests in 2020, he said, \u201cIn lots of cases, Black people are more\nracist than what white people are.\u201d\n\nHis wealth and notoriety have attracted the interest of tabloid newspapers and\ngossip magazines over the years.

Instead of\nending his troubles, his answers that day have resulted in him receiving a\n17-month custodial sentence, suspended for two years.\n\nEcclestone will also have to pay HMRC \u00a3652.6m, plus prosecution costs of\n\u00a374,000, after he admitted to failing to declare \u00a3400m in assets to the UK tax\nauthority.\n\nAfter arriving at court, wearing a grey three-piece suit, Ecclestone, whose 93rd\nbirthday is later this month, told the judge: \u201cI plead guilty.\u201d\n\nIt was a steep fall from grace for a man who commanded race paddocks \u2013 and\nsweetheart deals for special treatment from world leaders ranging from the UK\u2019s\nTony Blair to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u2013 from the late 1970s until January 2017.\nThat position made him one of the most prominent people in global motor sport.\nDuring that time, he grew Formula One into a prized global media asset while\nmaintaining tight control of the commercial and sporting sides of the business.\n\nEcclestone\u2019s rise started with a stint as owner of the Brabham racing team in\nthe 1970s, when he realised that the amateurish spirit of the sport was masking\nits commercial potential. He brought together rival teams and managed to\npersuade them to sell the broadcasting rights to the sport as a bundle, bringing\nserious television money in for the first time.\n\n\nEcclestone, then Brabham\u2019s owner, at the Belgian Grand Prix in 1978 with the\ndriver Niki Lauda. Photograph: Hoch Zwei/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThirty years later, he gradually gave up financial control of the business,\nselling a stake to the US private equity firm CVC in 2005. CVC left Ecclestone \u2013\nwho always appeared to relish the dealmaking as much as the sport \u2013 to his own\ndevices as the money rolled in. However, that changed when Liberty Media bought\nFormula One from CVC in 2017. Ecclestone, whose personal mode of doing business\ndid not appear to fit with modern ideas of corporate governance, was removed\nshortly after the takeover.\n\nLiberty has since aimed to draw back younger audiences \u2013 an approach Ecclestone\nin 2014 rejected because, he said, young people \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d Rolex watches.\nLiberty clearly thinks differently: it embraced social media, believing that\nincreased exposure would lead to more viewers. It has also produced a hit\nNetflix documentary, Drive to Survive, that has played a big part in Formula\nOne\u2019s huge growth in popularity in the US, a feat Ecclestone never achieved.\n\nEcclestone has faced legal troubles before. In 2014, he agreed, without any\nadmission of guilt, to pay \u00a360m to bring an end to a bribery trial in Germany,\nand in 2022 he was arrested by Brazilian police for carrying a gun while\nboarding a private plane, before paying bail. HMRC had opened its investigation\nin 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service said.\n\nThe tax authority gave Ecclestone the chance to correct any mistakes in his tax\nand pay what was owed plus a penalty via a non-criminal process. However, he\ncommitted a crime during a meeting in July 2015 when he said he was not the\nsettlor or beneficiary of any offshore trust in an interview with civil tax\ninvestigators.\n\n\u201cInformation provided to HMRC by the authorities in Singapore showed Ecclestone\nhad lied,\u201d the CPS said. Ecclestone initially pleaded not guilty in August, but\ncapitulated after \u201clengthy negotiations\u201d.\n\n\nEcclestone pictured with the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, left, and\nhis wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, at the Baku City Circuit in June 2016. Photograph:\nValdrin Xhemaj/EPA\n\nEcclestone has attended the occasional Formula One race since he was ousted,\nalthough his public profile has diminished \u2013 apart from him making increasingly\nbizarre statements criticising F1 and saying last year he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d\nfor Putin after the Russian leader ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLawyers for Ecclestone had argued in hearings in the case that his age was\ncatching up with him, and that he might not survive the shock of incarceration.\nThe judge, Mr Justice Bryan, said he noted the \u201cundoubted seriousness of your\noffending\u201d, but said he had taken into account the low risk of reoffending and\nother factors such as Ecclestone\u2019s age, his medical condition and the potential\nimpact of a prison sentence on his young child.\n\nEcclestone faced one more media scrum on Thursday as he got into the back of a\nwhite Range Rover outside the court. Asked for comment on his sentence, his\nanswer was too quiet to be heard.\n\nYet even with his reputation tarnished, the father of Formula One still has his\nfreedom.

He built a warm working relationship\nwith Russian President Vladimir Putin while negotiating to bring Formula One to\nRussia, with racing taking place in 2014 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nEcclestone told a television interviewer in Britain last year that Putin was a\n\u201cfirst-class person\u201d, and appeared to downplay the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is something that he believed was the right thing he was doing\nfor Russia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, he\u2019s like a lot of businesspeople, certainly like me, we make\nmistakes from time to time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d still take a bullet for him.

The Italian businessman\nwas banned indefinitely from any FIA-sanctioned event in 2008 following his\ninvolvement in Renault\u2019s \u201cCrashgate\u201d race-fixing scandal at that year\u2019s\nSingapore Grand Prix.\n\nHowever, this ban was lifted by the French courts in 2010. Although Briatore\ndidn\u2019t immediately set his sights on joining another team, he regularly attended\nGrands Prix over the next decade.\n\nThe 74-year-old joins an Alpine team in a state of relative turmoil, as several\ntop engineers and Directors have left the team after their poor 2023 season and\ndisastrous start to the 2024 campaign.\n\nIt all started part-way through the 2023 season when former Team Principal Otmar\nSzafnauer announced his departure from Alpine. Over the next several months,\nthis was followed by\u00a0resignations from Sporting Directors Alan Permane and\nDavide Brivio and Chief Technical Officer Pat Fry. Laurent Rossi also stepped\ndown from his senior role as CEO during this time. Technical Director Matt\nHarman Head of Aerodynamics Dirk de Beer and engineer Bob Bell joined the mass\nexodus in 2024.\n\nSince Briatore joined however, the Enstone and Viry-based outfit have enjoyed an\nuptick in form. Prior to the recent British Grand Prix, at least one of their\ndrivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon had contributed points for the team in the\nlast four events. This contrasted the first seven Grands Prix in which Alpine\nonly scored a single point.\n\nA RASCAL AMONG ANGELS COULD HELP\n\nSo could Briatore already be making changes to the structure and running of\nAlpine only months into his tenure as a mere advisor? Former F1 CEO Bernie\nEcclestone seems to think so.\n\nHe also revealed that he was the one who advised Renault CEO Luca de Meo to sign\nthe Italian. Speaking to Blick, Ecclestone stated: \u201cI spoke to Renault boss Luca\nde Meo on the phone for a long time.\n\n> \u201cHe was desperate. Then the word Briatore came up. We quickly agreed that in\n> such a confused situation, only a doer, a rascal among angels could help. And\n> there are enough saints in the Grand Prix circus!\u201d\n\nEcclestone believes that Briatore\u2019s unique personality will help Alpine climb up\nthe running order in the next few years. He concluded: \u201cFlavio\u2019s great strength\nhas always been to keep the discussions short, do and think big!\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need friends in Formula 1, you only need success.\u201d\n\nCan Alpine get back to points-scoring form at the Hungaroring?

        "content": "The superrich have often faced an age-old dilemma in handling their eye-watering\nfortunes. Do they invest in the stock market? Buy up property? Pick up a\nphilanthropy habit? Or simply go on a spending spree? The ex-wife of F1 mogul\nBernie Ecclestone has faced that same dilemma for some years since landing her\n$881 million divorce settlement.\n\nNow, her plans are starting to become clear.\n\nSlavica Malic, the ex-wife of 93-year-old billionaire Ecclestone, has set up a\nfamily office to manage her multi-million dollar fortune in the wake of her\ndivorce from the former CEO of Formula One in 2009, Bloomberg first reported.\n\nIt is expected that Malic, who divorced Ecclestone on the grounds of\n\u201cunreasonable behavior,\u201d will use the office to invest her nine-figure fortune.\n\nCompanies House filings reviewed by Fortune confirm that Malic set up a company\ncalled Elm Cove in August last year.\n\nTo run her office, Malic has enlisted the help of London-based trust manager\nStefan Le Marquand, filings show. She has also hired former HSBC managing\ndirector Fredrik Nerbrand as the office\u2019s chief investment officer, Bloomberg\nreported citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nNerbrand\u2019s LinkedIn profile says he is currently operating as chief investment\nofficer for a single family office. His tasks include setting up a new operating\nmodel for the office and investing \u201cin all asset classes but with a focus on\nwealth preservation.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Malic didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\nTHE EX-WIFE MILLIONAIRES CLUB\n\nMalic joins a long list of the ex-wives of billionaires who have been given the\nopportunity to build their own legacies in the wake of a divorce settlement.\u00a0\n\nThey have taken different routes in their journeys with their newfound\nindependent fortunes.\n\nMacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, came into an\napproximately $36 billion fortune after receiving 25% of Amazon\u2019s shares in her\ndivorce settlement with the former CEO.\u00a0\n\nShe has very publicly focused her efforts on philanthropy, claiming to have\ndonated $17.3 billion to more than 2,300 nonprofits since 2019.\n\nMelinda French Gates, the ex-wife of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, has poured\nbillions in philanthropic causes through the $63 billion Bill and Melinda Gates\nFoundation, which she continued to co-run after her divorce in 2021.\u00a0\n\nEarlier this week, Gates announced she would be stepping away from the\norganization. As part of the exit agreement, Gates will take with her a $12.5\nbillion pot to commit to her work \u201con behalf of women and families.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBased on Malic\u2019s chief investment officer\u2019s goals for the fund, it seems\nphilanthropy won\u2019t be her first priority, though she does appear to have a\nphilanthropic trust titled the Slavica Malic Foundation, founded in 2023.\n\nInstead, she will likely add her name to a growing pot of massive female-led\ninvestment funds looking to grow their wealth, including Oprah Winfrey who\nsimilarly started a family office in 2010.\n\nMalic will make up a rising tide of these female investors, who are expected to\ncontrol $30 trillion in the financial assets of baby boomers by the end of the\ndecade, according to McKinsey.\n\n\nBERNIE\u2019S BILLIONS\n\nMalic\u2019s ex-husband Ecclestone had effective control of the worldwide racing\nfranchise Formula One after buying the rights to the group in the 1970s,\nmaintaining a chokehold on the group\u2019s operations as CEO even after selling most\nof his stake in the 1990s.\u00a0\n\nThe company was sold to Liberty Media in 2017 for $8 billion, landing him a\nsizeable fortune. The nonagenarian currently has a net worth of around $2.4\nbillion, according to Forbes.\u00a0\n\nHowever, that fortune has taken a sharp haircut after a run-in with U.K.\nauthorities last year.\u00a0\n\nIn October, Ecclestone was forced to cough up \u00a3652 million ($793 million) after\nadmitting to defrauding the U.K.\u2019s HMRC, ending a decades-long dispute with the\ntax body.\n\nThe financial details of his divorce from Malic were laid bare as part of that\ngruesome investigation.\n\nRecommended Newsletter: CEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need\nto know from across the world of business.

About a third of\nIsraeli production is exported, either via pipeline to Egypt or as LNG to\nEurope. For comparison, the UK uses about 75 billion cubic metres of gas a year.\n\nSeparately, there are concerns that a rupture in the 45-mile-long Baltic Sea gas\npipeline from Finland to Estonia was due to sabotage. Finnish president Sauli\nNiinist\u00f6 has discussed the breach with Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general.\n\nThe pipeline is not a vital one but, as with the sabotaged Nordstream 2\npipeline, the incident shows the vulnerability of subsea infrastructure. The UK\nand Germany are both highly dependent on the much larger pipelines carrying gas\nfrom Norway.\n\nMeanwhile, in Australia, workers at Chevron\u2019s liquefied natural gas plant are\nthreatening strikes at the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities, which account for\nroughly 7pc of global LNG supply.\n\nOne analysis, by Trading Economics, which tracks economic indicators, said:\n\u201cPrices have surged more than 26% this week due to concerns about gas supplies\nas the heating season approaches, with colder temperatures expected.\n\nTom Faulkner, Head of Assets & Infrastructure and Networks at Cornwall Insight,\nsaid the damage to the Finnish pipeline was particularly concerning for European\nsupplies.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile the damage to the Finnish pipeline may not have immediate\nphysical consequences, it\u2019s expected to raise concerns among traders regarding\npotential threats to other gas infrastructure, in a similar fashion to\nNordStream.\n\n\u201cConsequently, although it may not directly affect supply security, this\ncombined with events in the Middle East, will undoubtedly contribute to a rise\nin gas prices, which will ultimately filter through to consumers\u201d.\n\nRead the latest updates below.",

At the wheel of his Red Bull, Max Verstappen seems increasingly untouchable.\nFor Bernie Ecclestone, however, the Dutchman would be just as victorious at the\nwheel of another competitive single-seater.\n\nWritten by By On 19/01, 16:39, archiv\u00e9\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Red Bull / Over the last three seasons, Max Verstappen's number of victories\nhas risen steadily.\n\n\n\nThe greatest Formula 1 drivers win with the best cars, and the best drivers are\nable to make the strongest cars perform. This is what Max Verstappen\ndemonstrated in 2023.\n\nThe Dutchman won 19 out of the 22 races of the season and stood on the podium 21\ntimes.

        "content": "Formula 1 seems to thrive on controversy. Just weeks before the start of the\n2016 season it was unclear what format qualifying would take and new regulations\nfor 2017 were being tested in the face of complaints from competitors.\n\nBut whatever happens on the track, the sport\u2019s parent company is heading in the\nright direction of profit \u2013 not\u00a0loss.\n\n\nA STABLE\u00a0OUTLOOK\n\nThe latest accounts available, for the year ending December 31, 2014, show F1\u2019s\nparent, Jersey-based company Delta Topco, made operating profits of $519.8\nmillion on revenue which accelerated 3.2 per cent to a record $1.8 billion.\nThere are several tricks under its bonnet which have fuelled this growth despite\na stagnating economy.\n\nF1 doesn\u2019t own any tracks or teams so its costs are kept under tight control.\nThe company only has around 352 staff and its biggest single cost is a payment\nof 63 per cent of its gross profits to the teams as prize money. Over the five\nyears to 2014 the prize money payment rose by 31 per cent to $863.1 million due\nto a boom in interest in F1. It is a staggering sum, but as it is a profit\nshare, it mitigates risk for Topco. That\u2019s not\u00a0all.\n\n\n\nOnly 10 to 20 per cent of Topco\u2019s contracts need to be renewed annually as they\nhave an average length of around five years. To insulate against inflation, the\nkey contracts also contain an escalator clause which increases the amount paid\nby 10 per cent\u00a0annually.\n\nThis makes F1 very different to other sports companies and teams as its\nperformance is not related to the events on track. It gives it a stable outlook\nand has driven Topco\u2019s valuation to $8.6 billion, according to figures from\nminority shareholder Ferrari.\n\nThe Italian motor marque listed on the New York Stock Exchange in October and\nthis led to an increased level of financial disclosure for the company. Its main\ninvolvement in F1 is through its famous racing team which features former\nchampions Sebastian Vettel and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen as its\u00a0drivers.\n\nHowever, Ferrari also has options on a 0.25 per cent stake in Topco and has had\nto release a valuation of it under its IPO obligations.\n\n> F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone has taken the sport and its 425 million\n> television viewers to emerging markets where it is used to drive\u00a0tourism\n\nIt shows that between December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 the valuation of\nthe options increased 1.7 per cent to $12 million giving Topco an equity value\nof $4.8 billion. The company had around $4 billion of debt last year with at\nleast $200 million in cash in the bank giving a net of $3.8 billion. Added to\nthe equity this gives Topco an enterprise value of around $8.6\u00a0billion.\n\nIt surprised many in F1 with one sports writer wrongly suggesting the value is\ninflated and claiming that \u201cthe price is clearly too high\u201d. This overlooked the\nfact it is based on an independent valuation from Ferrari, which is required by\nthe stock exchange, so it is far from\u00a0inflated.\n\n\nBOOSTING REVENUE\n\nF1\u2019s fortunes have actually been boosted by a steady stream of new races. Russia\nand Austria joined in 2014, while Mexico returned after a 23-year break in 2015\nand Azerbaijan is the new entry for\u00a02016.\n\nIt is part of a savvy strategy from F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone who has\ntaken the sport and its 425 million television viewers to emerging markets where\nit is used to drive tourism. The limited number of slots on the F1 calendar has\nfuelled a bidding war in the amount countries are prepared to spend to get a\nrace with the highest hosting fees rising to more than $60 million\u00a0annually.\n\nTogether, fees from race hosting and broadcasting amount to $1.2 billion of F1\u2019s\ntotal revenue with a further $161 million coming from TV production, as well as\ntravel and freight services to the sport\u2019s ten\u00a0teams.\n\nRevenue from the sale of tickets to F1\u2019s corporate hospitality outfit the\nPaddock Club grew 4.9 per cent to $110.9 million last year. It attracts some of\nthe world\u2019s wealthiest high rollers with recent guests including Michael\nDouglas, film-maker George Lucas and Mexican billionaire Carlos\u00a0Slim.\n\nGrowth last year was driven by increased corporate demand at the new races. The\nRussian Grand Prix was particularly well attended with President Vladimir Putin\nwatching the\u00a0race.\n\nCorporate hospitality revenue increased by $5.2 million to $89.2 million. F1\u2019s\nchief financial officer Duncan Llowarch says it was \u201clargely driven by the\neffect of 2014\u2019s calendar changes, with results from new races in Austria and\nRussia outperforming results from non-recurring prior-year events in Korea\nand\u00a0India\u201d.\n\nAdvertising and sponsorship received a similar boost. F1\u2019s portfolio of partners\nincludes luxury watchmaker Rolex and the Emirates airline which get benefits\nsuch as hoardings at the tracks and the right to use the sport\u2019s logo in\nadvertisements. Although F1 lost technology partner LG last year, it more than\nmade up for it, according to Mr\u00a0Llowarch.\n\n\u201cWhile the prevailing economic conditions continued to result in a difficult\nenvironment for advertising and sponsorship sales during 2014, the company was\nsuccessful in renewing one significant contract on improved terms which, along\nwith annual uplifts in other contracts and the sale of a small number of\nadditional advertising packages, more than offset the loss of one material\nadvertising partner. These arrangements allowed the company to report\nadvertising and sponsorship revenue of $254.4 million in 2014, which was $13\nmillion (5 per cent) higher than the prior year,\u201d he\u00a0says.\n\nThe power under F1\u2019s bonnet has boosted its revenue by around 80 per cent over\nthe past decade and, with long-term contracts in place, there is no suggestion\nit is slowing down. No doubt the naysayers won\u2019t slow down either, but they\u2019re\nunlikely to cause F1 to\u00a0crash.",

The firm\u2019s shares\nquickly rose, trading at nearly $19 as of 8 am Eastern time. The deal also\nminted two new billionaires, cofounders Donald Mackenzie and Rolly van Rappard.\n\nMackenzie's 6% stake is currently worth more than $1 billion. Mackenzie, who\nstepped down as co-chair of the firm on February 13 and remained on the board as\nhonorary co-chair in a non-executive capacity until the IPO, also sold a chunk\nof shares worth $180 million (pretax). That could grow by another $27 million\n(at the IPO price) if the company exercises its over-allotment option within 30\ndays.

Combined with his\nreported ownership of the 171-foot superyacht Grace, worth an estimated $23\nmillion according to VesselsValue, plus a Georgian estate on 866 acres in\nEngland\u2019s Dorset and a mansion west of London, Forbes estimates the\nScottish-born Mackenzie, 67, is worth $1.3 billion.\n\nVan Rappard, the 63-year-old managing partner and remaining co-chair, on the\nother hand, didn\u2019t sell any of his shares. His 6.7% stake is worth $1.3 billion.\nLike Mackenzie, he also owns a yacht, the 184-foot Blue II, worth an estimated\n$32 million per VesselsValue. He owns 50% of the ship, with the other half held\nby fellow CVC cofounder Steve Koltes through his Jersey-based family office\nKaltroco. The yacht can also navigate through sea ice in polar regions and\nfeatures a sauna, steam room and turkish bath.\n\nBorn in the Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao, the Dutch businessman\u2014whose full name\nis Louis Rodolph Jules Ridder van Rappard\u2014lives in London. His Luxembourg-based\nfamily office, Steflot, held $224 million in net book value as of its latest\nfiling in December 2022, including investment firm Imker Capital. Altogether,\nForbes estimates Van Rappard is worth at least $1.5 billion. Representatives for\nCVC declined to comment on the valuation.\n\nBefore the IPO, CVC also paid out a $327 million (pretax) dividend to its\nshareholders\u2014a payout that translates to roughly $23 million each for Mackenzie\nand Rappard and $14 million for Koltes.\n\nCVC was established in 1981 as the European operations of Citicorp Venture\nCapital, the VC arm of Citigroup. In 1993, Mackenzie, van Rappard, Koltes and\nfive other cofounders (all of whom have since left the company) acquired the\nbusiness and spun it out as CVC Capital Partners, going on to raise their first\n$630 million fund in 1996 and shifting their focus to private equity. CVC now\nhas $198 billion in assets under management with offices in 29 cities across six\ncontinents. It\u2019s best known for investments in sports, from its $2 billion\nleveraged buyout of the Formula 1 racing series in 2006\u2014which it sold to\npublicly traded Liberty Media for $8 billion (enterprise value) in 2016\u2014to its\n$2.1 billion deal with Spanish soccer league La Liga in 2021 for an 8.25% cut of\nTV rights over the next 50 years.\n\nCVC's holdings include pet food retailer Petco, which it bought alongside a\nCanadian pension fund for $4.6 billion in 2015; online university platform\nMultiversity, which it bought from Italian billionaire Danilo Iervolino in 2021;\nSwiss luxury watchmaker Breitling; plus other high-profile sports investments\nincluding the Women\u2019s Tennis Association and Indian Premier League cricket team\nGujarat Titans.\n\n\u201cWhen we founded CVC in the early 90s it was our ambition to create a\nmulti-generational business that would continue to flourish long after the\nfounders had gone,\u201d Mackenzie said in a statement announcing his departure in\nFebruary. \u201cI believe we have achieved that. The business is in very good shape\nand in good hands.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, CVC reported $1.2 billion in revenue, largely made up of $976 million\nin management fees, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization) of $692 million. While that was a 3.5% increase from 2022,\nit\u2019s a lot smaller than asset management behemoths such as BlackRock and\nBlackstone, or even European peers like Swedish private equity firm EQT\u2014all of\nwhich have annual revenues of at least $6 billion.\n\n\"They have a multi-pronged approach. They do private credit, providing credit\nopportunities for companies where they don't necessarily want to take loans from\nbanks. They also have pretty big infrastructure opportunities that they're\nworking on,\" says Dean Kim, head of equity research at brokerage William O'Neil.\n\nInfrastructure is a growing asset class for private equity, with BlackRock\nannouncing a $12.5 billion deal to acquire infrastructure-focused Global\nInfrastructure Partners in January. Last September, CVC bought a 60% stake in\nDutch infrastructure investment outfit DIF Capital Partners for an undisclosed\namount.\n\nCVC\u2019s IPO could be dampened by heightened tensions in the Middle East and market\npessimism about interest rate cuts in the U.S., which has dragged down the stock\nprices of BlackRock and Blackstone by 8% and 4%, respectively, over the past\nmonth. But in Europe, where the European Central Bank is expected to cut rates\nsoon, there could be stronger growth for asset managers like CVC.\n\n\u201cEuropean asset managers should do well in the long term because the ECB is on\nits way to cut rates,\u201d adds Kim. \u201cAnd when that happens, asset gathering becomes\neasier, there's more liquidity in the market. Money has to go somewhere it can\ngenerate returns.\"\n\nThe largest shareholder in CVC is publicly traded private equity firm Blue Owl\nCapital, which bought a 10% stake in several CVC subsidiaries for about $1.1\nbillion in November 2021, falling to 8.1% before the IPO. The firm, which has\nminted two billionaires\u2014Doug Ostrover and Michael Rees\u2014since going public itself\nin 2021, then bought more shares in the public offering for roughly $211\nmillion, giving it a 9.4% stake after the transaction worth $1.8 billion.\n\nWhile not as wealthy as Mackenzie and van Rappard, Koltes\u2014the only other\ncofounder who still has a role at CVC\u2014also saw a significant boost to his net\nworth. His 4.2% stake is worth some $760 million, plus roughly $41 million\n(pretax) from share sales, which could grow to $47 million with the\nover-allotment. The 68-year-old American stepped down as CVC\u2019s co-chair in\nJanuary 2022 and served as honorary co-chair alongside Mackenzie in a\nnon-executive role until the IPO. His family office, Kaltroco, has also invested\nin Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Taim, auto industry M&A advisory\nfirm Dave Cantin Group and German VC firm 468 Capital. Forbes estimates Koltes\nis worth more than $800 million.\n\n\u201cCVC outgrew a dependence on any single individual or group of individuals long\nago. The firm attracts, motivates and energizes a collection of talent second to\nnone. For everything I can do well, there are dozens in the firm who can do it\nbetter,\u201d Koltes said in a statement when he stepped down in January 2022.\n\nTwo longtime CVC executives, Rob Lucas and Javier de Jaime Guijarro, kept all of\ntheir shares in the firm after the IPO. Their stakes are worth about $660\nmillion and $650 million, respectively.",
        "summary": "Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners went public on the Euronext Amsterdam on Friday at a price of $15 (\u20ac14) per share. The firm\u2019s shares quickly rose, trading at nearly $19 as of 8 am Eastern time. The deal alsominted two new billionaires, cofounders Donald Mackenzie and Rolly van Rappard.",

It gets a lot of people\ninterested in different things, because they come to see this and it follows\nthem.\u201d\n\nFormula E is currently in its 10th season, and has achieved many huge milestones\nwithin that time. As well as becoming an official FIA World Championship in\n2020, it has welcomed the biggest names in manufacturing and motorsport, as well\nas being consistently competitive and breaking records whilst doing so.\n\nHISTORY: Looking back through Formula E's key moments\n\nCatching up with drivers such as race-winner Sam Bird (NEOM McLaren) and DS\nPENSKE\u2019s Jean-Eric Vergne, Ecclestone spoke about his first experience of the\nall-electric World Championship.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought it wouldn\u2019t last. I thought the first race would be the last,\u201d\nEcclestone confessed when talking about the championship\u2019s debut event, the 2014\nBeijing E-Prix which was won by Lucas di Grassi (ABT CUPRA). \u201cSo I am very\npleased to see that technically it has become very good. Technically, it\u2019s\nFormula 1 level.\u201d\n\nREPORT: Sam Bird seals NEOM McLaren's first win with last-gasp stunner in S\u00e3o\nPaulo\n\nFour different drivers from four different teams have won the first four races\nof Season 10. The impressive stats don\u2019t stop there either, as nine drivers from\nthe 22-car grid have also stood on the podium in the first four rounds of the\nyear.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the problem with Formula 1 at the moment is we have got one person that\nis winning all the races,\u201d Ecclestone added. \u201cIt\u2019s not good. I hope it doesn\u2019t\nhappen with Formula E, but they can see different countries being represented,\nand winning races.\u201d\n\nJoining Ecclestone, who lives in close proximity to S\u00e3o Paulo was Formula E\nfounder and Chairman Alejandro Agag.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were actually remembering when exactly we met,\u201d Agag said to the Former\nChief Executive of the Formula 1 Group, Ecclestone. \u201cI think it goes back to 25\nyears ago, when we met for the first time in Italy and I was still in my\npolitical times. Since then, Bernie and I have been friends.\u00a0\n\nCALENDAR: Where will Formula E race in 2024?\n\n\u201cBernie has always opened the door for me in motorsport. He brought me into\nmotorsports. Then when I went electric, he looked at me and said, \u2018be careful\nwith that\u2019, but always supported me. He promised one day he would go to a race,\nnow he is here in Formula E.\u201d",

        "content": "The core revenues of Formula 1\u2019s parent company come from selling the rights to\nhost and broadcast races as well as advertising and corporate hospitality at the\ntracks. In the early days of F1, teams made separate deals with grand prix\npromoters and television coverage was sporadic as it could be cancelled at the\nlast moment if there were not enough cars to fill the\u00a0grid.\n\nF1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, who was then owner of the\nchampionship-winning Brabham team, saw that cash would come from television. In\n1981 he convinced the teams to sign a contract committing them to race. He then\ntook it to TV companies so they could guarantee coverage. His company Formula\nOne Promotions and Administration negotiated the deals and took a share of the\nproceeds with the remainder going to the teams and the governing body the\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile.\n\nClick here for the full infographic\u00a0\n\n\nSHOWCASING THE BIG\u00a0NAMES\n\nWith guaranteed TV exposure, sponsors\u2019 rates increased giving the teams more\nmoney to spend on cutting-edge technology in a bid to win. In turn, this\nattracted the best drivers which made the series even more appealing to\nbroadcasters. Big name car manufacturers, such as Honda, Renault, Porsche and\nLamborghini, became involved through supplying engines to the\u00a0teams.\n\nFierce rivalries and intense battles for championship supremacy were the norm in\nthe 1980s with Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet all vying for glory\nthroughout the decade. However, it was Brazil\u2019s Ayrton Senna driving for McLaren\nwho got everybody talking. Arguably one of the most iconic images of the era was\nhis controversial clash with team mate Prost in Japan in 1989. It put both\ndrivers off the track and although Senna made it back on to win the race, he was\nlater disqualified for using an escape road to rejoin the circuit, handing the\ntitle to\u00a0Prost.\n\n\n\nThe Brazilian also dominated the early-1990s, winning consecutive world\nchampionships in 1990, following yet another controversy in Japan with Prost,\nand in 1991 after a dominant season with\u00a0McLaren.\n\n> With guaranteed TV exposure, sponsors\u2019 rates increased giving the teams more\n> money to spend on cutting-edge technology in a bid to\u00a0win\n\nBritish hopes too were rewarded at last in 1992 when, after years of frustration\nand retirement threats, Nigel Mansell stormed to championship glory, becoming\nthe first Brit to do so since James Hunt in 1976 and setting the scene for the\nrest of the decade, which was to be largely dominated by his team Williams. A\nnew era beckoned in 1993 as Prost, now also racing for the British marque,\nclaimed his fourth and final title before taking the decision to leave the sport\nbefore the start of the 1994\u00a0season.\n\nThings were changing in F1, and with fresh new talent in the form of Michael\nSchumacher and Mika Hakkinen on the horizon, to many it seemed as good as it\ncould get. Then Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 after\ncrashing out from the lead and it looked like the sport was facing its darkest\nhour. However, Senna\u2019s death drew the world\u2019s attention to F1 at a time when\nthere was plenty of drama on the track and the sponsors were pumping in\nsignificant financial support.\n\n\nTHE SCHUMACHER YEARS\n\nOver the next few years, television audiences soared, particularly in Germany\nwhere fans were rewarded with their first champion when Schumacher took the 1994\ncrown for his Benetton\u00a0team.\n\nAnother dominant title for Schumacher followed in 1995 in his final year at\nBenetton before heading to Ferrari. It heralded the beginning of a career that,\nthough often shrouded in controversy, would earn him a place among the legends\nof F1 thanks to a record-breaking total of seven\u00a0titles.\n\nHis first win at Ferrari came at the 1996 Spanish Grand Prix in poor conditions,\nshowcasing his skill and allowing audiences worldwide a glimpse at his superstar\nstatus. Schumacher went on to finish his first season for Ferrari in third\nposition, behind the seemingly unassailable Williams. He was able to take the\nfight to Williams\u2019 Jacques Villeneuve in 1997, just a single point behind when\nthe championship rolled into Spain for the finale. But a shunt with the Canadian\nput Schumacher out of the race and ultimately he was stripped of all\nchampionship points for causing the collision.\n\n\n\nHe was runner-up in 1998 behind Hakkinen and a broken leg in a crash at\nSilverstone the following year kept him out of the title fight. By 2000,\nSchumacher and Ferrari were back on form and their dominance of the 21st century\nbegan, cementing Schumacher\u2019s position in the history books with five titles\nfrom 2000 to\u00a02004.\n\nAs the on-track action electrified it made F1 even more attractive to TV\nstations and in 2001 Schumacher\u2019s success brought it to the attention of German\nmedia giant Kirch. It borrowed $1.6 billion from three banks to acquire a 75 per\ncent stake in F1. State-owned German bank BayernLB loaned $987.5 million with\nLehman Brothers and J.P. Morgan each providing $300\u00a0million.\n\nHowever, Kirch lacked the key to a fortune as the terms of a 1999 bond issue\nprevented F1 from paying a dividend. By the time Kirch collapsed under the\nweight of its debts in 2002, it had not made any money from the sport and, to\nthis day, remains the only shareholder not to have received a\u00a0return.\n\n\nCVC AND THE\u00a0FUTURE\n\nThe loans from the trio of banks were secured on the F1 stake and when Kirch\nwent into administration they enforced their security. However, in the vacuum,\nthey lost control of the business. When CVC, the private equity firm, bought the\nbusiness from the banks, it didn\u2019t make the same mistake\u00a0twice.\n\n> It has given CVC a 351.8 per cent return on investment and its remaining\n> shares are worth another $3\u00a0billion\n\nCVC bought F1 in 2006 in a leveraged buyout funded with two loans \u2013 $965.6\nmillion from its investment Fund IV and $1.1 billion from the Royal Bank of\nScotland. It covered its\u00a0back.\n\nBuried in the articles of association of F1\u2019s parent company Delta Topco is the\nrevelation that CVC\u2019s shares entitle it to appoint representatives, known as I\ndirectors, who can \u201cexercise one vote more than the total number of votes\nexercised by the other directors\u201d. The articles add that the purpose of this is\n\u201cto ensure that the I directors will always have sufficient votes to pass a\nresolution of the\u00a0board\u201d.\n\nThis control puts a huge premium on CVC\u2019s stake and its riches were unlocked\nwith a debt refinancing which allowed dividends to be\u00a0paid.\n\n\n\nOver the past decade CVC has halved its stake to just under 35 per cent and\nreaped a $4.4-billion reward which comprises 31 per cent of the total generated\nfor F1\u2019s owners. It has given CVC a 351.8 per cent return on investment and its\nremaining shares are worth another $3 billion at the latest valuation of the\nbusiness from $8.6 billion to $10\u00a0billion.\n\nTo put this in context, CVC had made 314 per cent on its \u20ac184 million investment\nin British bookmaker William Hill by the time it exited through share sales and\nan IPO in 2002. Likewise, the \u00a330 million CVC invested in stockbroker Collins\nStewart generated a return of 292 per cent from share sales and a 2002 IPO. Its\nbiggest return is believed to have been from the 2005 sale of Spanish hospital\noperator IDC which came to 831 per cent. F1 may overtake it if CVC actually\nsells\u00a0up.\n\nAccording to CVC\u2019s co-chairman Donald Mackenzie, there is no need to do this.\n\u201cThere is no end date. We have 12-year funds, which we have to return the\noriginal money. We have already done that. So the pressure\u2019s off. We like owning\nit [F1]; we don\u2019t want to sell it. There are always some people who\u2019d like to\nbuy it \u2013 it\u2019s a very good\u00a0business.\u201d\n\n\nKEEPING F1\u2019S WHEELS\u00a0TURNING\n\n\n\nIt may seem like the biggest decisions in Formula 1 are made on the track, but\nin fact the most powerful people in the sport are found behind the\u00a0scenes.\n\nF1\u2019s nerve centre is the paddock, an oblong tarmac space between the teams\u2019\nmobile offices and their transporters which back up to the pit garage rear\ndoors. The area was historically a working environment for team staff, but F1\nchief executive Bernie Ecclestone has made it one of the most sought-after\nplaces to be in world\u00a0sport.\n\nThe motorhomes are where team bosses discuss race strategy, and drivers eat,\ndrink and wind down. They are essentially the drivers\u2019 locker rooms and passes\nto the paddock cannot be bought. In itself this adds to the allure and\nexclusivity of the paddock, but that\u2019s just the start. As interest in F1\naccelerated so too did the desire for celebrities and VIPs to be seen at the\nraces, and the paddock is the place to find\u00a0them.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be confused with the Paddock Club which is where corporate guests\nnetwork and fuel F1\u2019s multi-million-dollar budgets. Teams give passes to their\nsponsors who, in turn, invite clients to do business and close deals in the\nPaddock Club. Potential sponsors are also invited by the teams so that they can\nget an inside look at what is on offer from a partnership. It keeps F1\u2019s\nwheels\u00a0turning.\n\nThe Paddock Club is managed by Austrian catering firm Do&Co, which has an army\nof staff to make the venue work. Hundreds of staff are involved at each race\nincluding chefs, catering staff, electricians, security, entertainers, florists,\ntherapists and\u00a0cleaners.\n\nSecurity, logistics, construction and catering tend to be handled by the same\ncontractors throughout the season meaning that teams and sponsors know what they\nwill get at any race no matter where in the world it is\u00a0held.",
        "summary": "The core revenues of Formula 1\u2019s parent company come from selling the rights to host and broadcast races as well as advertising and corporate hospitality at the tracks. In the early days of F1, teams made separate deals with grand prixpromoters and television coverage was sporadic. Bernie Ecclestone convinced the teams to sign a contract committing them to race so they could guarantee coverage.",

Ms He asked if the Singapore Government has received any requests from UK law\nenforcement agencies in relation to the case involving former Formula 1 boss\nBernie Ecclestone. It is our policy, in line with international practice, not to\ncomment on whether a foreign government has made a request for legal assistance\non specific cases.\n\n2. That said, we can confirm that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),\nSingapore Police Force (SPF) and Attorney General\u2019s Chambers (AGC) have worked\nclosely with UK authorities on their investigation and prosecution of Mr\nEcclestone. In fact, Singapore proactively shared relevant information with our\nUK counterparts, which helped them develop their case.\n\n3. In 2017, MAS conducted an inspection of the bank cited in recent media\nreports, to assess its controls for mitigating money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing risks. During the inspection, MAS specifically reviewed the bank\u2019s\nhandling of its relationship with Mr Ecclestone. While MAS found that there was\nroom for improvement in the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering processes, it did not\nfind gaps or weaknesses that were systemic in nature. MAS also noted that when\nadverse news about Mr Ecclestone first surfaced in 2013, the bank promptly\nsubjected the account to enhanced monitoring controls by requiring all\ntransactions to be flagged for scrutiny and approval.\n\n4. MAS will continue to work with financial institutions to ensure that our\nfinancial sector\u2019s defences against financial crime remain robust.\n\n***",
