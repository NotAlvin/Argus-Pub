        "content": "Insiders were net sellers of China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited's (HKG:2319 )\nstock during the past year. That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to\nlong-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what\ninsiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\n\nCHINA MENGNIU DAIRY INSIDER TRANSACTIONS OVER THE LAST YEAR\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the\nExecutive Vice-Chairman, Minfang Lu, sold HK$13m worth of shares at a price of\nHK$26.33 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's\nmore concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort\nthat this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price,\nwhich is HK$14.76. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at\ncurrent levels. The only individual insider seller over the last year was\nMinfang Lu.\n\nMinfang Lu sold a total of 634.00k shares over the year at an average price of\nCN\u00a526.40. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies\nand individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who\nsold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nSEHK:2319 Insider Trading Volume June 6th 2024\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then\nyou might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying\nunder the radar).\n\n\nINSIDER OWNERSHIP\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your\nview of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider\nownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests.\nIt appears that China Mengniu Dairy insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth\nabout HK$84m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere,\nbut these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the\nother shareholders.\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES THIS DATA SUGGEST ABOUT CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY INSIDERS?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded China Mengniu Dairy\nshares in the last quarter. Still, the insider transactions at China Mengniu\nDairy in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But we do like the fact\nthat insiders own a fair chunk of the company. In addition to knowing about\ninsider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing\nChina Mengniu Dairy. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for China\nMengniu Dairy you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially\nsuperior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies,\nthat have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report\ntheir transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/food-beverage-tobacco/hkg-2319/china-mengniu-dairy-shares/news/heres-what-to-make-of-china-mengniu-dairys-hkg2319-decelerat",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next\nmulti-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed\n(ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed.\nPut simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are\ncontinually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However,\nafter investigating China Mengniu Dairy (HKG:2319), we don't think it's current\ntrends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\n\nRETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE): WHAT IS IT?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much\npre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in\nits business. To calculate this metric for China Mengniu Dairy, this is the\nformula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total\nAssets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.066 = CN\u00a55.5b \u00f7 (CN\u00a5115b - CN\u00a533b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to\nDecember 2023).\n\nTherefore, China Mengniu Dairy has an ROCE of 6.6%. In absolute terms, that's a\nlow return and it also under-performs the Food industry average of 8.6%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nSEHK:2319 Return on Capital Employed July 14th 2024\n\nIn the above chart we have measured China Mengniu Dairy's prior ROCE against its\nprior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you\ncan check out the forecasts from the analysts covering China Mengniu Dairy for\nfree.\n\n\nTHE TREND OF ROCE\n\nIn terms of China Mengniu Dairy's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly\ndemand attention. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at\naround 6.6% and the business has deployed 100% more capital into its operations.\nThis poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in\ncapital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into\nhigh return investments.\n\n\nOUR TAKE ON CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY'S ROCE\n\nIn summary, China Mengniu Dairy has simply been reinvesting capital and\ngenerating the same low rate of return as before. And investors appear hesitant\nthat the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 50% in the last five\nyears. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger\ndiscussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more\nluck elsewhere.\n\nLike most companies, China Mengniu Dairy does come with some risks, and we've\nfound 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of\ncompanies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "When close to half the companies in Hong Kong have price-to-earnings ratios (or\n\"P/E's\") below 8x, you may consider China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited\n(HKG:2319) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 15.4x P/E ratio. Although, it's\nnot wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why\nit's so lofty.\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy could be doing better as its earnings have been going\nbackwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings\ngrowth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this\npoor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise\nyou're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nSEHK:2319 Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry March 26th 2024\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report\non China Mengniu Dairy will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\n\nDOES GROWTH MATCH THE HIGH P/E?\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market\nfor P/E ratios like China Mengniu Dairy's to be considered reasonable.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits\nfell to the tune of 22%. However, a few very strong years before that means that\nit was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 41% in total over the last three\nyears. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going,\nshareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest\nearnings should grow by 16% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the\nrest of the market is forecast to expand by 15% per year, which is not\nmaterially different.\n\nIn light of this, it's curious that China Mengniu Dairy's P/E sits above the\nmajority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly\naverage growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock.\nThese shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E\nfalls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.\n\n\nTHE FINAL WORD\n\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within\ncertain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nWe've established that China Mengniu Dairy currently trades on a higher than\nexpected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market.\nWhen we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the\nshare price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places\nshareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an\nunnecessary premium.\n\nBefore you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for China\nMengniu Dairy that you should be aware of.\n\nYou might be able to find a better investment than China Mengniu Dairy.

        "link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/food-beverage-tobacco/hkg-2319/china-mengniu-dairy-shares/news/heres-why-china-mengniu-dairy-hkg2319-can-manage-its-debt-re-1",
        "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about.\nWhat we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the\nsmart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a\nvery important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many\nother companies China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) makes use of\ndebt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\n\nWHAT RISK DOES DEBT BRING?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying\noff its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't\nfulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with\nnothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a\ncompany must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under\ncontrol. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any\nnegative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first\nlook at cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\n\nHOW MUCH DEBT DOES CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY CARRY?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that\nChina Mengniu Dairy had CN\u00a536.2b of debt in December 2023, down from CN\u00a538.0b,\none year before. However, it does have CN\u00a513.7b in cash offsetting this, leading\nto net debt of about CN\u00a522.6b.\n\nSEHK:2319 Debt to Equity History April 30th 2024\n\n\nHOW HEALTHY IS CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY'S BALANCE SHEET?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, China Mengniu Dairy had\nliabilities of CN\u00a532.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of CN\u00a532.0b due\nbeyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had CN\u00a513.7b in cash and CN\u00a512.5b in\nreceivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum\nof its cash and (near-term) receivables by CN\u00a538.4b.\n\nThis is a mountain of leverage relative to its market capitalization of\nCN\u00a559.8b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company\nneeded to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its\nnet debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and\namortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by\nits interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the\nabsolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.7, which signals significant\ndebt, but is still pretty reasonable for most types of business. However, its\ninterest coverage of 1k is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on\nthe debt is currently quite low. One way China Mengniu Dairy could vanquish its\ndebt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around\n18%, as it did over the last year. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet\nis the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the\nbusiness will decide if China Mengniu Dairy can strengthen its balance sheet\nover time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report\nshowing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept\ncold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free\ncash flow. Over the most recent three years, China Mengniu Dairy recorded free\ncash flow worth 63% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow\nexcludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when\nit wants to.\n\n\nOUR VIEW\n\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for China Mengniu\nDairy was the fact that it seems able to cover its interest expense with its\nEBIT confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging.\nFor instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to handle its total\nliabilities. Considering this range of data points, we think China Mengniu Dairy\nis in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think\ndebt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt\nlevels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all\ninvestment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. We've identified\n1 warning sign with China Mengniu Dairy , and understanding them should be part\nof your investment process.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a\nrock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks\nwithout delay.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) shareholders should be happy to\nsee the share price up 13% in the last month. But that is small recompense for\nthe exasperating returns over three years. Tragically, the share price declined\n61% in that time. So the improvement may be a real relief to some. While many\nwould remain nervous, there could be further gains if the business can put its\nbest foot forward.\n\nIt's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in\nlockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some\ndisparity between the two. So let's do just that.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett\ndescribed how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a\nbusiness. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to\nlook at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per\nshare (EPS).\n\nDuring the unfortunate three years of share price decline, China Mengniu Dairy\nactually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 11% per year. This is quite\na puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share\nprice. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has\ndisappointed.\n\nSince the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share\nprice, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nWe note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 7.4% annual rate,\nso that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. It's probably worth\ninvestigating China Mengniu Dairy further; while we may be missing something on\nthis analysis, there might also be an opportunity.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you\nclick on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nSEHK:2319 Earnings and Revenue Growth May 21st 2024\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage,\nsuggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to\ncheck out what analysts think China Mengniu Dairy will earn in the future (free\nanalyst consensus estimates)\n\n\nA DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE\n\nInvestors in China Mengniu Dairy had a tough year, with a total loss of 45%\n(including dividends), against a market gain of about 7.1%. Even the share\nprices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the\nfundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably,\nlast year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total\nloss of 7% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said\ninvestors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that\ninvestors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find\nit very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for\nbusiness performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other\ninformation, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for China\nMengniu Dairy that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued\nsmall caps that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market\nweighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Hong Kong exchanges.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "On the evening of June 12, Shanghai-based Miaoke Landuo Food Technology Co.,\nLtd. (600882.SH, referred to as \"Miaoke Landuo\") announced that it would acquire\n100% equity in Inner Mongolia Mengniu Cheese Co., Ltd. (referred to as \"Mengniu\nCheese\") from its controlling shareholder, Inner Mongolia Mengniu Dairy (Group)\nCo., Ltd. (referred to as \"Mengniu\"), for 448 million yuan in cash.\n\nBoth Miaoke Landuo and Mengniu Cheese are subsidiaries of Mengniu. This\nadjustment represents Mengniu's restructuring of its cheese business segment,\nconsolidating the cheese operations under the listed company Miaoke Landuo to\nresolve issues of internal competition. Miaoke Landuo stated that this move aims\nto leverage the advantages of both entities, enhance quality and efficiency, and\npromote coordinated development, ultimately boosting the listed company's\nprofitability and core competitiveness.\n\nAccording to Miaoke Landuo's disclosure, Mengniu Cheese's annual revenue exceeds\n1.2 billion yuan but remains loss-making. The transaction did not bolster Miaoke\nLanduo's stock price, which fell on June 13, with a market value of 6.815\nbillion yuan.\n\nNotably, Miaoke Landuo was once a \"star stock\" in the dairy industry, with\nsignificant performance growth driving its stock price above 80 yuan per share\nin May 2021. Since 2020, Mengniu has repeatedly acquired Miaoke Landuo shares at\nhigh valuations. Now, this decision has resulted in a paper loss for Mengniu,\nand the investment return is under market scrutiny.\n\nThe roots of this acquisition trace back to 2021. In July 2021, after Miaoke\nLanduo issued private shares to Mengniu, Mengniu became its controlling\nshareholder. Due to overlapping and competitive businesses, Mengniu promised to\ninject its cheese operations, including related raw material trade, into Miaoke\nLanduo within two years. This commitment was later extended to be fulfilled by\nJuly 9 of this year, with shareholder approval.\n\nAs per Miaoke Landuo's announcement, as of December 31, 2023, the audited book\nvalue of Mengniu Cheese's consolidated balance sheet stood at 438 million yuan.\nIncluding government subsidies and other factors, the transaction price was set\nat 448 million yuan. Miaoke Landuo stated it would use its own or self-raised\nfunds for the acquisition, without directly or indirectly using raised funds.\n\nEstablished in December 2018, Mengniu Cheese currently operates two wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries engaged in cheese production: Tianjin Aishireen Dairy Products Co.,\nLtd. and Aishireen Dairy Products Import and Export Co., Ltd. According to the\nannouncement, Mengniu Cheese's revenue in 2023 was 1.273 billion yuan, with a\nnet loss attributable to the parent company of 3.373 million yuan. In the first\nquarter of 2024, it reported revenue of 211 million yuan and a net loss of 2.952\nmillion yuan.\n\nIn 2023, Miaoke Landuo's revenue was 4.049 billion yuan, a year-on-year decline\nof 16.16%, with net profit at 63.4395 million yuan, down 53.9%. In the first\nquarter of 2024, revenue was 950 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 7.14%,\nwith net profit at 41.2975 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 70.63%.\n\nMiaoke Landuo's focus on cheese coincided with a hot segment in the dairy\nindustry. After specializing in cheese, the company experienced rapid growth. In\n2020, its revenue was 2.847 billion yuan, up 63.2% year-on-year, with net profit\nrising 208.16% to 59.258 million yuan. In 2021, revenue and net profit increased\nby 57.31% and 160.6%, respectively.\n\nThe remarkable performance of Miaoke Landuo and its cheese segment attracted\nMengniu's attention, leading to multiple rounds of acquisition starting in early\n2020.\n\nMengniu's acquisition of Miaoke Landuo was conducted in several phases: In\nJanuary 2020, Mengniu first invested 287 million yuan to acquire 5% of Miaoke\nLanduo at 14 yuan per share. Subsequently, Mengniu increased its stake through\nvarious means, including private placements and centralized bidding, at\nprogressively higher prices. For instance, in December 2020, Mengniu invested 3\nbillion yuan to purchase Miaoke Landuo shares at 29.71 yuan per share; by\nOctober 2022, the purchase price had risen to 30.92 yuan per share.\n\nAs Mengniu continued its acquisitions, Miaoke Landuo's stock price soared,\nreaching 84.5 yuan per share in May 2021, with a market value exceeding 40\nbillion yuan. However, the current market value of Miaoke Landuo has since\nshrunk to around 6.8 billion yuan, with its stock price significantly lower than\nduring Mengniu's various acquisitions. This has led to external skepticism and\nchallenges regarding the large investments Mengniu made in Miaoke Landuo.\n\nSong Liang, head of the expert group of the China Dairy Industry Alliance,\nbelieves Mengniu's investment in Miaoke Landuo is strategically significant. At\nthe time of the acquisition, Mengniu was expanding its business landscape into\nareas like raw milk and infant formula, including acquiring Modern Dairy and\nAustralian formula brand Bellamy's. Post-acquisition, Mengniu gained a\nfirst-mover advantage in the cheese segment. Mengniu's management has repeatedly\nexpressed optimism about the cheese business segment.\n\nCheese, often called \"milk gold\" due to its high protein and calcium content,\nrepresents a high-end form of dairy products, typically made from ten pounds of\nmilk to produce one pound of cheese. Given its high gross profit margin, the\ncheese sector has attracted numerous enterprises, particularly with the rise of\nchildren's cheese stick products, creating new growth points for companies like\nYili and Mengniu and nurturing new brands like Dr. Cheese and Miaofei.\n\nHowever, rapid development has also led to price wars and increased raw material\ncosts, negatively impacting company profits.\n\nAn executive from a cheese company in East China told the Economic Observer that\nthe cheese market faces another variable: due to cost constraints, cheese is\npriced higher than other dairy products, and consumer eating habits are not yet\nfully developed. When consumer spending becomes more cautious, the cheese market\nfaces challenges. As a result, many cheese companies, after years of rapid\ngrowth, are now at a crossroads, seeking new points of leverage beyond the\ncheese stick product.\n\nSong Liang stated that with the integration of Mengniu's cheese business into\nMiaoke Landuo, resource sharing can be achieved, such as using Mengniu's raw\nmaterials instead of importing from companies like Fonterra. He believes that\ncompanies should develop cheese products more suited to Chinese consumer dietary\nhabits and seek growth by expanding into baking and food service markets.\n\nBeyond the cheese business, Mengniu is also undergoing other internal\nadjustments. In July 2023, Mengniu privatized the publicly listed infant formula\ncompany Yashili and rebranded its products under the \"Mengniu\" trademark.\n\n\"By packaging the cheese business into Miaoke Landuo, Mengniu is making more\nconcrete adjustments to its business segments, aiming to create a concentrated\nresource platform for each category,\" Song Liang concluded.",
        "summary": "On June 12, Shanghai-based Miaoke Landuo Food Technology Co. (600882.SH) announced that it would acquire 100% equity in Inner Mongolia Mengniu Cheese Co. Ltd. (referred to as \"MengniuCheese\") for 448 million yuan in cash. The move aims to leverage the advantages of both entities, enhance quality and efficiency, and promote coordinated development.",

        "content": "KEY INSIGHTS\n\n * Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, China Mengniu Dairy's\n   stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n * A total of 5 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51%\n   ownership\n * Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good\n   understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nA look at the shareholders of China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) can\ntell us which group is most powerful. With 53% stake, institutions possess the\nmaximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum\nupside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal,\ninstitutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with\nindividual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money\ninvested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of China Mengniu Dairy, beginning\nwith the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nSEHK:2319 Ownership Breakdown June 25th 2024\n\n\nWHAT DOES THE INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP TELL US ABOUT CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates\nthe local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are\nincluded in major indices.\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they\nown a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for\nthose institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like\nanyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on\na stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's\ntherefore worth looking at China Mengniu Dairy's earnings history below. Of\ncourse, the future is what really matters.\n\nSEHK:2319 Earnings and Revenue Growth June 25th 2024\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board\nwill likely have to pay attention to their preferences. China Mengniu Dairy is\nnot owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest\nshareholder is COFCO Corporation with 24% of shares outstanding. First Sentier\nInvestors (Australia) IM Ltd is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of\ncommon stock, and Fidelity International Ltd holds about 7.0% of the company\nstock.\n\nOn looking further, we found that 51% of the shares are owned by the top 5\nshareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the\ndecisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it\nalso makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is\nblowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it\nmight be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\n\nINSIDER OWNERSHIP OF CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between\njurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at\nthe very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should\nrepresent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers\nare on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is\nwell aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power\nis concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of China Mengniu Dairy Company\nLimited in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an\nindirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even\na small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and\nshareholders. In this case insiders own HK$75m worth of shares. Arguably, recent\nbuying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see\nif insiders have been buying or selling.\n\n\nGENERAL PUBLIC OWNERSHIP\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in\nChina Mengniu Dairy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can\ncertainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPANY OWNERSHIP\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 24%, of the China Mengniu Dairy stock. It's\nhard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who\nowns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have\nan interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a\ncompany. But to understand China Mengniu Dairy better, we need to consider many\nother factors.

        "content": "According to Jiangxi Business Daily, Shanghai Mengniu Yogurt Technology Co.,\nLtd. was established at the beginning of 2024 with a registered capital of 10\nmillion yuan. Its activities include internet sales, brand management, supply\nchain management services, home goods sales, food sales, and other areas. The\nsole shareholder of the company is Inner Mongolia Mengniu Dairy (Group) Co.,\nLtd.\n\nOn March 26, Mengniu made important personnel changes. According to the\ncompany's official statement, the group's president, Lu Minfan, was appointed\nvice chairman with the functional role of executive director. Gao Fei, former\nsenior vice president and head of the fresh product division, assumed the\nposition of company president and became an executive director.\n\nOn March 27, at the Mengniu 2023 performance conference, new president Gao Fei\nstated that regardless of who holds the position of president today, Mengniu's\nstrategy remains unchanged. Currently, the industry is facing some challenges,\nand Mengniu will actively respond to them.\n\nThe annual report showed that in 2023, Mengniu Dairy achieved operating income\nof 98.624 billion yuan, an increase of 6.5% over the previous year, while net\nprofit was 4.809 billion yuan per year, a decrease of 9.31% from the previous\nyear.\n\nAt a briefing on March 27, Lu Minfan stated that the decrease in net profit was\nmainly due to the devaluation of large packages of powdered milk caused by\nexcess fresh powdered milk storage, dividend taxes, intensified market\ncompetition, and increased sales expenses.\n\nIn 2020, Mengniu Dairy's operating profit was 76.035 billion yuan. In 2023,\noperating profit was closest to the target of 100 billion yuan set by Lu Minfan\nin 2017.\n\nMengniu has long held a leading position in the dairy industry. The company was\nfounded in 1999 by Niu Genshen. In just 8 years, Mengniu became the two-time\nchampion of the global liquid milk market and China's dairy industry.\n\nNiu Genshen's successor, Yang Wenzhun, continued his efforts. In 2007, Mengniu\nDairy's operating profit reached 21.318 billion yuan, surpassing Yili's 19.360\nbillion yuan, becoming the largest dairy company in China. This status was\nmaintained until 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Mengniu Dairy's operating profit reached 37.388 billion yuan, ranking\nsecond in China. In 2012, Yili's operating profit reached 41.991 billion yuan,\nwhile Mengniu Dairy's operating profit fell to 36.080 billion yuan.\n\nIn 2012, Sun Yiping, who worked at Coca-Cola, became the third president of\nMengniu Dairy. In 2014, Sun Yiping pushed Mengniu to acquire 75.3% of Yashili's\nshares for 11.3 billion Hong Kong dollars. However, during Sun Yiping's era,\nMengniu slowed its growth pace, while Yili accelerated, widening the gap between\nthem.\n\nAfter Lu Minfan took over the company, he carried out a series of radical\nreforms and large-scale mergers and acquisitions to achieve the goal of\nincreasing profits to 100 billion.\n\nMengniu Dairy acquired Modern Dairy in 2017 and Shengmu Hi-Tech in 2018. From\n2020 to 2021, it controlled Magic Lando, and in 2022, it acquired Shanghai-based\nDanone's business for low-temperature products.\n\nAfter these acquisitions, Mengniu Dairy's operating profit exceeded 60 billion\nyuan in 2017, approached 80 billion yuan in 2019, and approached 100 billion\nyuan in 2023. However, whether it is operating profit or net profit, the gap\nbetween Mengniu Dairy and Yili remains significant.\n\nIn 2022, Yili's operating profit will reach 123.171 billion yuan. For the first\nnine months of 2023, Yili's operating profit was 97.404 billion yuan, close to\nMengniu Dairy's annual operating income.\n\n\nThe gap in net profit is even greater. For the first nine months of 2023, Yili's\nnet profit was 9.380 billion yuan, almost double that of Mengniu Dairy.\n\nAnalysts believe that the key factors contributing to Mengniu's growth slowdown\nare poor sales of fresh white milk and devaluation of significant volumes of\npowdered milk. The company often participates in actions to reduce prices for\nfresh milk, leading to increased costs. In addition, previous mergers and\nacquisitions did not meet expectations.\n\nHow will Gao Fei change the situation after taking over leadership?\n\n\nGao Fei, 47, joined Mengniu in 1999 and held positions as vice president of\nsales, general sales manager, marketing general manager, and group vice\npresident.\n\nAnalysts say that China's dairy industry is currently facing problems such as\nexcess raw milk and intensified competition in the industry, entering a period\nof growth constraints. The hope that Gao Fei brings to Mengniu and the market is\nthat besides being a veteran of Mengniu and charismatic, Gao Fei's advantage\nlies in understanding the market and being good at marketing.\n\n\"He is one of those who knows Mengniu best and has created the company's most\nsuccessful products,\" colleagues say.",

        "content": "China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) stock is about to trade\nex-dividend in 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a\ncompany's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which\nshareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of\nconsequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least\ntwo business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase China Mengniu Dairy's shares\nbefore the 14th of June in order to receive the dividend, which the company will\npay on the 26th of June.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is CN\u00a50.489 a share, following on from the last\n12 months, when the company distributed a total of CN\u00a50.49 per share to\nshareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that China Mengniu Dairy\nhas a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current share price of HK$14.30. Dividends\nare an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the\nbusiness is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should\nalways check whether China Mengniu Dairy has been able to grow its dividends, or\nif the dividend might be cut.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more\nthan it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut.\nFortunately China Mengniu Dairy's payout ratio is modest, at just 40% of profit.\nA useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether China Mengniu Dairy\ngenerated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 37% of\nits free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash\nflow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings\ndon't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its\nfuture dividends.\n\nSEHK:2319 Historic Dividend June 10th 2024\n\n\nHAVE EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS BEEN GROWING?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers,\nbecause it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving.\nInvestors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced,\nexpect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're\nencouraged by the steady growth at China Mengniu Dairy, with earnings per share\nup 9.4% on average over the last five years. Management have been reinvested\nmore than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company\nhas been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. We think this is\ngenerally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination\nof earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its\nhistorical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, China Mengniu Dairy\nhas lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's encouraging\nto see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at\nleast some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nShould investors buy China Mengniu Dairy for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per\nshare growth has been growing somewhat, and China Mengniu Dairy is paying out\nless than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for\na few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the\nbusiness, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might\nbe nice to see earnings growing faster, but China Mengniu Dairy is being\nconservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over\nthe long run. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of\nfurther research.\n\nOn that note, you'll want to research what risks China Mengniu Dairy is facing.\nFor example, we've found 2 warning signs for China Mengniu Dairy that we\nrecommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.\nHere's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The company attributed\nthe gain in part to sustained double-digit growth in China and strong\nperformances by core brands, including Kiri and Boursin. Sales in China\nincreased for the fourth consecutive year, driven in part by the performance of\nKiri cheese. Strengthening its presence there was Bel\u2019s acquisition of a\nmajority stake in China\u2019s Shandong Junjun Cheese.\n\nThe second quarter 2023 results for Yum China showed record growth in total\nrevenues and operating profit.

So, what do they see in this homegrown infant powder\nstar?\n\nOne answer is the healthy dividends it is spinning off. It paid an interim\ndividend amounting to 1.1 billion yuan last September, equal to 30% of profits.\nAnd in its latest results announcement, it promised to return another 40% of its\nprofit in a dividend whose amount will be determined and approved at its annual\nmeeting.\n\nSuch dividend payments are a popular strategy for attracting investors by\nconsumer stocks like Feihe, which tend to soak up plenty of revenue but whose\nslower growth stories tend to be less attractive than sexier companies from\nsectors like tech and new energy.\n\nDividends aside, Feihe\u2019s latest results offer clues that the company may be\nworking hard to diversify beyond its core infant formula into powdered milk for\nchildren and adults, as well as new milk products with better growth potential.\nAnd it has 10.5 billion yuan in cash to cushion it through any transition. While\nits sales of infant milk formula products fell 10.3% to 17.8 billion last year,\nsales of its \u201cother dairy products\u201d actually rose by 23.4%.\n\nInfant milk formula makes up 91.5% of Feihe\u2019s revenue, with \u201cother\u201d dairy\nproducts, such as adult milk powder, liquid milk and rice powder supplements,\naccounting for a far smaller but faster-growing 7.3%. The shift to those other\ngroups looks like a positive trend in the face of demographic inevitability with\nChina\u2019s plunging birth rate.\n\nA total of 9.02 million babies were born in the country last year, the lowest\nnumber since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949 and the second year\nof sharp declines. In addition to falling birth rates, companies like Feihe are\nalso facing the challenge of recently overhauled government regulations on\ninfant milk powder quality that some are calling the toughest in the world.\n\nThe objective is to set standards as close as possible to breast milk. The\ntoughness is also partly in response to a 2008 scandal where six infants died\nand another 300,000 fell ill after drinking infant formula spiked with melamine,\na toxic chemical that some producers used to boost their scores in milk protein\ntests.\n\nMany of the 400 brands in the market before the new regulations have now left,\nand remaining players have had to re-certify their products. The market\nturbulence forced at least one major international player, Nestl\u00e9 (NESN.SW), to\nclose a baby milk factory in Ireland last October that produced milk solely for\nthe Chinese market.\n\nFALLING MARGINS\n\nOther metrics for China Feihe\u2019s 2023 fiscal year were equally dismal as its top-\nand bottom-line numbers. Its gross profit margin fell to 64.8% from 65.5% in\n2022. And 2022\u2019s results were nothing to get excited about either, with revenue\nand profit down 6.4% and 28.4% from 2021 levels, respectively.\n\nThe company\u2019s 2021 annual report, whose cover featured a gold star and a can of\nmilk powder, included the last time revenue increased, rising 22.5% to 22.7\nbillion yuan. But even in the peak year of 2021, profit was down by 7%.\n\nThe year 2021 was also when China officially adopted its \u201cthree-child\u201d policy,\nraising the permissible number of children to three from the previous two. In\n2016 the government abandoned its decades-old \u201cone child\u201d policy that imposed\nfines and other restrictions on couples who went beyond the limit. Feihe\u2019s\nshares were hitting record highs around that time, rising to more than three\ntimes their IPO price of HK$7.50 from 2019, as investors bet it could become a\nbig beneficiary of the government\u2019s call for people to have more children.\n\nBut the policy changes have failed to have the desired effects of improving\nbirth rates, with many people citing the high cost of raising children as a\nmajor deterrent. Feihe\u2019s shares sagged as its revenue began contracting with the\nfalling birth rates, and its current share price is now about half its IPO\nprice.\n\nFeihe\u2019s stock certainly isn\u2019t alone in feeling the shrinking pains of China\u2019s\ndeclining fertility rates. Shares of leading dairy Yili Industrial (600887.SS)\nalso peaked in 2021 before falling. But unlike Feihe, Yili\u2019s top and bottom\nlines have both been rising since 2020. The same is true for Mengniu Dairy\n(2319.HK), whose shares also peaked in 2021, but whose revenue and profit\ncontinue to rise. Mengniu subsidiary China Modern Dairy (1117.HK) has similar\nstock trends, but has recorded falling profits despite growing revenue.\n\nThose differences might imply that the regulatory change has favored older\nplayers like Mengniu and Yili with closer state ties, at the expense of newer\ncompanies like Feihei and Modern Dairy. Feihe\u2019s heavy reliance on infant formula\nis also working against it, while its peers have more diverse product lines. Its\nrecent diversification moves are aimed at weaning it from overreliance on the\ninfant market, but the transition is taking time.\n\nAll those differences show up in Feihe\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is\nmarkedly lower than the other three companies. Its stock currently trades at a\nratio of 7.4, compared with 13 and 17 for Mengniu and Yili, respectively. China\nModern Dairy trades at the highest ratio of 33.\n\nThe strong market reaction to Feihe\u2019s latest earnings could partly reflect the\nstock\u2019s current low valuation as well as enthusiasm about the company\u2019s dividend\npolicy. Investors may also like Feihe for its position in the relatively\nrecession-proof consumer space, which should help to stabilize its revenue even\nas people cut back on spending in more discretionary areas in the current\nclimate of economic uncertainty.\n\nTo subscribe to Bamboo Works free weekly newsletter, click\u00a0here\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\n",
        "summary": "China Feihe posted declines in both profits and sales last year, as it is heavily exposed to the country\u2019s falling birth rate. The company, which gets 91% of its revenue from infant milk formula, may remain attractive to investors due to its pledge to pay much of its profits as dividends.",

        "link": "https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/food-beverage-tobacco/hkg-2319/china-mengniu-dairy-shares/news/china-mengniu-dairy-company-limiteds-hkg2319-fundamentals-lo",
        "content": "With its stock down 18% over the past month, it is easy to disregard China\nMengniu Dairy (HKG:2319). But if you pay close attention, you might find that\nits key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock\ncould potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more\nresilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study China\nMengniu Dairy's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a\ncompany's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used\nto assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\n\nHOW IS ROE CALCULATED?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders'\nEquity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for China Mengniu Dairy is:\n\n9.6% = CN\u00a54.9b \u00f7 CN\u00a551b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every HK$1 of its\nshareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of HK$0.10.\n\n\nWHAT HAS ROE GOT TO DO WITH EARNINGS GROWTH?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is\ngenerating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company\nreinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the\ngrowth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal,\nfirms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth\nrate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\n\nCHINA MENGNIU DAIRY'S EARNINGS GROWTH AND 9.6% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, China Mengniu Dairy's ROE is not much to talk about. However,\nits ROE is similar to the industry average of 8.7%, so we won't completely\ndismiss the company. Having said that, China Mengniu Dairy has shown a modest\nnet income growth of 9.8% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE,\nit is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this\ngrowth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed\nefficiently.\n\nAs a next step, we compared China Mengniu Dairy's net income growth with the\nindustry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher\nthan the average industry growth of 0.7%.\n\nSEHK:2319 Past Earnings Growth April 15th 2024\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its\nearnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has\npriced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they\nwill have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy\nwaters await. If you're wondering about China Mengniu Dairy's's valuation, check\nout this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\n\nIS CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY MAKING EFFICIENT USE OF ITS PROFITS?\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median\npayout ratio of 29% (or a retention ratio of 71%) and a respectable amount of\ngrowth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making\nefficient use of its profits.\n\nBesides, China Mengniu Dairy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or\nmore. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its\nshareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the\ncompany is expected to rise to 43% over the next three years. Still, forecasts\nsuggest that China Mengniu Dairy's future ROE will rise to 12% even though the\nthe company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some\nother characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated\ngrowth in the company's ROE.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOverall, we feel that China Mengniu Dairy certainly does have some positive\nfactors to consider. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company\nreinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt\ncontributed to its high earnings growth. We also studied the latest analyst\nforecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to\nits current growth rate. To know more about the company's future earnings growth\nforecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company\nto find out more.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "link": "https://www.farmersjournal.ie/agribusiness/news/rollercoaster-year-for-factory-prices-801370",
        "content": "No matter what the price of beef is, there is always a big range of prices paid\nbetween factories for the exact same type of animal. Based on average slaughter\nweights, up to \u20ac225 per head more was paid for R3 cows and \u20ac180 per head more\nfor O=3= steers between the highest- and lowest-paying factories that reported\nprices for at least 10 weeks last year. The smallest gap in prices paid was \u20ac71\nfor U=3= heifers.\n\nOne of the frequent warnings we give in presenting this data is to be conscious\nof how external factors may influence the prices paid. These include the likes\nof organic and speciality breeds for which factories pay a premium \u2013 if there\nare substantial numbers of these in a factory\u2019s kill, then the prices they\nreport will be inflated. Similarly, some factories pay an extra bonus to attract\ncattle in a narrow weight range, which others buy off the grid, and deals at\nflat-rate prices will often reflect higher prices for lower grades and lower\nprices for the top grades.\n\nAnother variable that can distort the picture is the effect of a factory killing\na minuscule number of cattle over the year and if these were bought at either an\nexceptionally high or exceptionally low price, they won\u2019t necessarily reflect\nthe mainstream value.\n\nTo address this, an extra column has been added to this year\u2019s league tables\nidentifying the number of weeks in the year for which prices in each particular\ngrade for each factory were reported.\n\nMain findings\n\nThe categories chosen to reflect 2023 are four different grades from steers,\nheifers, young bulls and cows.\n\nThese are U=3=, R=3=, O=3= and P+ 3= giving 16 categories overall and cover the\nvast majority of cattle that are going through Irish factories.\n\nAll the factories that reported for 2022 are still reporting in 2023. Kavanagh\nMeats Enniscorthy started price reporting during 2023 but are excluded from the\nleagues as they don\u2019t have a full year of data. Kildare Chilling is separate\nfrom the Dawn group because that deal was only concluded during the year.\n\nWhile factories outside the main groups claimed several podium positions, some\nof which were based on a small number of cattle reported, several of them\nincluding ABP, Dawn and Kepak occupied positions in top half of the table. (See\nbelow)\n\nFoyle may have had less podium positions than previous years but it was still\nthere or thereabouts and it is one of the factories that pays extra for a narrow\nweight range on steers and heifers.\n\nAshbourne pushed into the top three for O=3= steers and was a consistent buyer\nas it reported for 52 weeks in that category. It was second for P+3= young bulls\nthough with a small sample size.\n\nMoyvalley claimed a first and second place in P+3= and O=3= young bulls, while\nEurofarm was second for R=3= young bulls with Foyle top for the U=3= grade.\nLiffey claimed a third place finish in the P+3= young bull category.\n\nCows\n\nWhen it comes to cows, the top positions are dominated by factories outside the\nmain groups. C&J Meats is widely known as a strong buyer of top-quality cows and\nthis is reflected in the table where it occupies the top position for U=3= and\nR=3= cows and a second place for O=3= cows.\n\nThese are the best-quality suckler-bred cows and C&J reported on these for 46\nand 52 weeks for the U and R grading cows, respectively, in 2023.\n\nTraditional Meat Company took top position for the O=3= and P+3= cows, reporting\non 50 and 25 weeks, respectively, and a second place for the R=3= grade based on\n51 weeks reporting.\n\nLiffey is also a strong cow buyer and had two third places, with Dawn\nBallyhaunis and ABP Nenagh claiming one each.\n\nGroup performance\n\nABP has the edge on U=3= and R=3= steers and heifers though it is pipped by Dawn\nfor the O=3= grade, who are also top for the P+3= grade followed by Kepak with\nABP back in third.\n\nThe top positions are divided between the big three for young bulls but when it\ncomes to cows, when the factories outside the main groups are taken together,\nthey are the top-payers in all categories apart from P+3= grade. There were some\nexcellent cow prices paid in 2023 and this merits further analysis.\n\nFactory margins\n\nIrish beef processing is privately owned and there are no accounts published\nwith the exception of Foyle and C&J Meats whose businesses operate both sides of\nthe border and in the case of Foyle it has two abattoirs in Britain as well.\n\nDunbia, which is the UK division of Dawn Meats also publishes accounts and while\nthis is outside the Republic of Ireland, between them they will give an\nindication of the financial performance. As well as being a very limited sample,\nwe also have to note that in these cases accounts are for the 2022 financial\nyear.\n\n\n\nSuckler cows and calves.\n\n\n\nC&J has a factory outside Lifford in Co Donegal, a cutting plant in Co Armagh\nand is a stakeholder in an abattoir in Co Antrim. In the year to 30 November\n2022, it had a turnover of \u00a369.1m (\u20ac80.3m), up from \u00a358.9m (\u20ac68.5m) in 2021.\n\nOperating profit for the year was \u00a3727,025 (\u20ac845,377) and after interest and\ntaxation, profit for the year was \u00a3490,692 (\u20ac570,572). The breakdown of sales is\n\u00a337m (\u20ac43m) to the UK with \u00a332m (\u20ac37m) to Europe.\n\nDunbia, the UK division of Dawn Meats since 2020, also continues to publish\nannual accounts. It is headquartered in Dungannon Co Tyrone, where it has a beef\nand sheep abattoir, cutting plant and retail packing unit. Across the UK, it has\n13 locations and for 2022 posted a \u00a31.37bn (\u20ac1.59bn) turnover with an operating\nprofit of \u00a312.79m (\u20ac14.87m).\n\nThe Foyle Food Group has an abattoir and cutting plant located in Cargins, Co\nDonegal, and two in Northern Ireland at Lisahally, Co Derry, and Omagh, Co\nTyrone. It also has two factories in Britain. Turnover at the Foyle Food Group\nHoldings Ltd increased to \u00a3482m (\u20ac560.4m) in 2022, up from \u00a3410m (\u20ac476.7m) in\n2021 with operating profit at \u00a312.9m (\u20ac15m) compared with \u00a314.6m (\u20ac17m) the\nprevious year and net profits were \u00a39.3m (\u20ac10.8m), down from \u00a310.7m (\u20ac12.4m) in\n2021.\n\nNumbers useful for guidance and an indication of trends\n\nLooking at factory profit figures where they exist, profits that are stated in\nmultiple millions look spectacular. There is do doubt that a well-run beef\nprocessing business can be extremely profitable but when the numbers are\nanalysed in these examples, we can see that profit margins are running between\njust under 1% and 2.7%.\n\nQuestion\n\nThe other question that remains unanswered is how representative are these\nnumbers for beef processing in the Republic of Ireland?\n\nAll of the Dunbia business is UK-based as is the largest percentage of the Foyle\nbusiness and the C&J business has a significant contribution from northern\ncattle, as well as from its Donegal factory. As with the factory league tables\nfor cattle prices, these numbers are useful for guidance and an indication of\ntrends.",

        "content": "The suckler herd involved in the trial\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 in Co. Tyrone has partnered with a\nNorwegian-based agri-tech company in a new hill-farm grazing trial.\n\nThe trial is set to examine how \u2018virtual fencing\u2019 can optimise the grazing\nmanagement of a suckler herd in a hill farm setting.\n\nSpeaking to Agriland, Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke explained what the\nresearch hopes to achieve.\n\nHe explained that the project is being initially trialled on 26 cows and a\nbreeding bull. No collars are placed on the calves.\n\nThe trial will examine how effective the virtual fencing is in the hill\nlandscape where phone signal is poor.\n\nInitial indications are showing the virtual fence is effective despite the low\nsignal in the region and the farm has plans to expand the project to more cattle\nin the near future.\n\nClarke added that the \u2018virtual fence\u2019 is essentially a collar that is placed on\nthe livestock. A phone app shows the farmer where the cattle are located.\n\nL-r: Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke, Ann Elinor Aasen from Monel, Wayne\nAcheson from Foyle Food Group and Christoffer Grindheim from Monel\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here in the office and if I want to give the cattle grazing on the\nhill a fresh area to graze, I can use the technology to create a bigger grazing\nzone for the cattle to make their way into.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s free entry for the cattle to get into the zone but once they try to go\n> out of the zone they hear a noise and they get that noise three times and then\n> it goes to a shock.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a solar panel on the collars. They\u2019re charged up at the start of the\nyear and the solar panel will keep them charged for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cThe phone app will tell you what each collar battery is and if you have a\ncollar not working or the battery\u2019s not charging, it will let you know,\u201d he\noutlined.\n\nThe collars were fitted last week and have been \u201cworking well\u201d on the herd so\nfar, according to the Foyle representative.\n\nWilson Marshall from the Foyle Food Group agri-team (left) pictured with Monil\nstaff\n\nClarke said: \u201cThere\u2019s two reasons we wanted to trial the collars. Firstly, we\nwant to better manage the grazing of the cattle on the hill.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the cattle to graze areas of the hill where they wouldn\u2019t\nnormally go as a group.\n\n> \u201cSecondly, whenever we\u2019re serving cows with a bull on the hill, sometimes the\n> cows could be on one end of the hill and the bull could be on the other. The\n> cow could be cycling and the bull would never see her within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the virtual fencing is to keep the livestock batched and moved\nacross the hill. We hope to be able to basically rotationally graze the hill.\nThat\u2019s what were trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe fence can be managed from a smartphone\n\nThe Norwegian-based company involved in the trial with Foyle is \u2018Monil\u2019.\n\nAccording to their website, Monil is \u201ca startup [business] challenging\ntraditional fences with our innovative virtual fencing technology, allowing\nanimals to roam freely while giving farmers complete control over their herd\u2019s\nlocation and well-being\u201d.\n\n\nFOYLE FARM\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 is located in Co. Tyrone and the\noverall farming operation encompasses 1,100ac of land. 570ac of this is\nmountain-type ground, 250ac is lowland grazing and the rest is lowland silage\nground.\n\nThe farm is continuously conducting research and trials with the aim of\nproviding practical and up-to-date information to Foyle\u2019s beef suppliers on ways\nto further improve the economic and environmental sustainability of their farms.\n\nSome of the areas on which the farm is currently conducting research includes\nbest practice on grassland management, soil health, animal nutrition, and\nbedding for livestock.\n\nMore information on the farm can be found here.",
