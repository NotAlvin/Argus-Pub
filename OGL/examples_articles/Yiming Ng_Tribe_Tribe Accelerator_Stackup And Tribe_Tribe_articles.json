I join Randy in\nwelcoming you to the third webinar of the 2017 series. This series is sponsored\nby two US Department of Energy organizations: the Office of Indian Energy Policy\nand Programs, and the Western Area Power Administration. The Office of Indian\nEnergy directs, fosters, coordinates, and implements energy planning, education,\nmanagement, and programs to assist tribes with their energy development,\ncapacity building, energy infrastructure, energy costs, and electrification of\nIndian lands and homes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To provide this assistance we work within\nthe Department of Energy across government agencies with Indian tribes and\norganizations through the deployment program, again, to help Indian tribes and\nAlaska Native villages overcome the barriers to energy development. Our\ndeployment program is composed of a three-pronged approach consisting of\nfinancial assistance, technical assistance, and education and capacity building.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And this tribal energy webinar series is one\nexample of our education capacity building efforts. This series is part of the\nOffice of Indian Energy's efforts to support fiscally responsible energy\nbusiness and economic development decisions making an information sharing among\ntribes. It is intended to provide attendees with information on tools, to\nresources to develop and implement tribal energy plans, programs, and projects.\n\nIt is also intended to highlight tribal energy case studies and identify\nbusiness strategies tribes can use to expand their energy options and develop\nsustainable local economies. Today's webinar \u2013 Pitching Your Projects \u2013 will\nprovide guidance on how to sell your project idea to individuals and entities,\nthe need to support your project if it is successful. And in the investment\nworld this is known as a pitch. Regardless of the industry the skill of pitching\nideas is basically the same.\n\nAnd in this webinar attendees will receive tips on how to improve their pitch to\nincrease its likelihood of securing supporting, buy-in, and investment, and how\nto engage your audience and get them interested in how to share project visions\nand more. The webinar is designed to be a precursor to the 2017 National Tribal\nEnergy Summit taking place next week, May 1st through the 3rd in Washington, DC\nwhich will also include a matchmaking session where attendees can pitch their\nprojects to investors, lenders, and project developers.\n\nWe hope that the webinar series is useful but welcome feedback. So please let us\nknow. And with that I'll now turn the virtual floor back over to Randy.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you Lizana. And our two other speakers today\ninclude Doug MacCourt and Scott Geary and I'll introduce both of them now. Doug\nis the senior policy advisor to the director and staff of the Office Indian\nEnergy Policy and Programs. He works throughout DOE with other federal [audio\ncuts out]. . . . published Renewable Energy Development in Indian Country: A\nHandbook for Tribes. And it's listed in Chambers USA: America's Leading Lawyers\nfor Business and Best Lawyers in America for Native American and Natural\nResource Law.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to joining DOE Mr. MacCourt was a\npartner in the Portland firm Ater Wynne where he led the land use and\nredevelopment practice in the firm's business group and subsequently started and\nled the firm's Indian Law practice. And then following Doug is Scott Geary.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Geary is managing partner at Stone Angel\nCapital with more than 20 years of experience in finance and operations and\nearly career in engineering and particle physics at Stanford Linear Accelerator\nCenter and Ford Motor Company provided an analytical foundation before he moved\ninto venture capital-backed technology companies in Silicon Valley. Scott ended\nup in private equity and is considered a functional expert in finance and\nrestructuring.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has experience in raising multiple rounds\nof financing from early-stage in angel financing through later-stage\ninstitutional financing. Recent highlights include CFO of one of the 50 largest\nplastic injection molders in North America, chief restructuring officer for a\n$50 million dollar oil and gas services firm, and chief restructuring officer\nfor one of the world's largest SCUBA companies. And he has held the roles of\nCEO, CFO, and COO at various times in his career.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He is currently working on several\ninitiatives and healthy communities efforts in Indian Country. He has a BS in\nelectrical engineering from Northeastern University and an MBA from INSEAD. And\nwith that Doug give me a moment to get your slide deck pulled up and we'll get\nstarted.\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well great. Thank you Randy. This is Doug MacCourt. I'm\nthe senior policy advisor here at headquarters at Department of Energy with the\nOffice of Indian Energy. And good morning and good afternoon to everyone\ndepending upon where you're calling in from. It's an honor and a privilege to\nparticipate in the webinar series here. And as Lizana mentioned this special\nwebinar is really designed as a primer for everyone who is \u2013 whether you're\ncoming to the Summit or not but in particular for everyone's who's interested in\nproject finance and how to approach the folks with the money.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so the way we're going to break this\ndown between Scott and me is I'm going to give some fundamentals of the pitch\nbut really spend most of my presentation on the audience you're pitching to. And\nunderstanding the difference between who you may be talking to depending upon\nwhat kind of investor they are or whether they're a lender. And what kind of\nfinancial product may be in the mix whether it's bond or debt, venture capital\ninvestment, tax credit investment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And typically it's a combination of all of\nthose things. So we're going to go over some fundamentals and of understanding\nwho those people are that you're speaking to. But the information is also\ncritical in developing the pitch itself and developing your project prospectus\nas well as its executive summary. So the information that I'm covering will and\nshould find its way into the pitch that you make at various levels when you're\ntalking to the investing community and the particular investors or finance folks\nthat you're making your pitch to.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So with that we'll go to the first slide.\nAnd in some respects this \u2013 Okay I think Randy we have the old deck up but\nthat's okay. The first slide that we'll post on our website actually has three\nfundamental basics of the pitch. And so if you've got something to write with\nyou can write this down now. Otherwise we'll post this version when we're\nfinished. And it comes down in many cases as Scott will elaborate there are more\nthan three issues and ideas that you've got to communicate.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But at a basic level if you're pitching a\nproject concept to investors \u2013 and this is a project concept now. There may be\nother things you're going after financing for. But for projects they will need\nto know at least the following three things. First, is this the right management\nteam \u2013 in other words who's making the pitch \u2013 with the right experience and the\nproper authority to pull the project off? Second, is the project sized and\nscoped correctly to make the financing work?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And we'll talk a little bit more about what\nI mean by that as we get further into the presentation. And third, can the folks\nyou're making the pitch to understand the project fundamentals in an executive\nsummary of no more than two to three pages? Because if they don't get it in that\namount of time and in that short amount of density you're probably losing them.\nSo with those Randy we'll stick to the slide that you've got up which says\nbefore we jump into project finance.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And these are some resources that the\nDepartment of Energy has created for searching financial assistance through the\nDepartment of Energy. The reason I put this slide in this presentation is one\nissue that I'm not going to delve into directly in much \u2013 spend much time on \u2013\nis leveraging other resources. And of course that's as Lizana explained a big\npart of what the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs is all about.\n\nIt's getting those resources out to Indian Country and doing it in a way with\nenough diversity and with enough different objectives to try to address the\nneeds in Indian Country when it comes to energy and related economic\ndevelopment. So we can go to the next slide. And with the next slide we're going\nto start to dive in to the issues relating to why you're doing this in the first\nplace. And to start off at a high level it's no mystery that economic\ndiversification is key to financial self-sufficiency.\n\nAnd that's whether you're in tribal government, state government, or in a\ncommercial business. But it's particularly important this notion of\ndiversification because it has various ramifications including building the\ncapacity and building the experience of how to finance run a startup and run a\nbusiness. Now financing established tribal enterprises is challenging;\ncapitalizing a new venture is even more difficult.\n\nSo tribes that are pursuing diversification efforts should expect that initial\ncapital \u2013 And again whether you're trying to refinance or put more capital into\nan existing business or fund a new one will either need to be in the form of\nsignificant equity or \u2013 and oftentimes both are required. It will require\nsubstantial support in the form of guarantees from the existing enterprise cash\nflow or a general obligation of the tribe.\n\nAnd the bottom line is it is expensive. And tribes looking to invest in an\nentirely new commercial enterprise would do well to plan for as much of an\nequity contribution as they think they can cobble together and afford. Next\nslide.\n\nSo when we're talking about clean energy projects, due to the nature of existing\nsubsidies and existing financing models, the vast majority of these projects\nhave been financed through what we call a tax equity model which is a\ncombination of some amount of sponsor equity. And typically in this case the\ntribe is the primary sponsor but not always. Second, bank debt, and third, tax\nequity or monetization of tax credits.\n\nAnd it's the equity that's really going to be the focus of this presentation.\nWhat does that mean and where does it come from? What various sources of it are\nout there? And how do you actually approach people that have it? Next slide.\n\nSo a couple of fundamentals before we dive into that relating to project\nfinance. When the finance package comes together and you bring in the debt with\nthe investment we are primarily talking about nonrecourse debt meaning the\nlenders do not have any other collateral except for the assets of the project.\nThis is particularly important in Indian Country not only due to the\nrestrictions of alienating trust land and limitations on how you monetize what\nyou're allowed to do in the form of mortgage type guarantees for trusts and\nother restricted lands.\n\nBut it's important for protecting tribal fiscal assets which is of course a key\nand important objective of any project the tribe is going to enter into. A\ncouple of other notes: lenders loan to cash flows, and against assets. And that\nis maybe one of the most important fundamentals of this presentation. And that\ngoes for investors as well. Investors do not want to walk away from the deal and\nrely upon the collateral that's used for security. They're in it for the cash\nflow.\n\nThe last thing any of the finance people want to ever have to deal with is the\nasset itself. And that's why the money flows to the cash flows and against the\nassets, and the assets of course being the solar panels, the turbines, and the\ninfrastructure. The loan repayment is from the project cash flows net of\noperating and capital expenses. And the project cash flows will provide the\nscheduled debt repayment which includes a number of different buckets. Next\nslide.\n\nSo I'm going to give you a little background on some common debt structures.\nMany of you may already be familiar with this but you're going to hear these\nterms and you'll often hear them in the form of questions coming from the\ninvestors or the lenders or proposals from the investors or lenders and how they\nwant to complete or envision a total finance package.\n\nA general obligation structure is a promise to pay for all available monies,\ntypically backed by the full faith and credit of the tribe or the other\norganization providing the obligations. And unsecured general obligation is\nwhere you have a promise with no particular revenue stream or bundle of assets\nthat secures the debt. And conversely a secured general obligation is where\nthere is some particular revenue stream or bundle of assets pledged to secure\nthe borrowing. Next slide.\n\nA revenue obligation is where you have revenues pledged to secure the borrowing,\nbut the general credit of the tribe is not. And lenders have recourse only\nagainst that stream of revenues pledge, similar to the concept of nonrecourse\nfinancing. Asset-backed obligations is a situation where borrowing is secured\nprimarily or solely by one or more specific assets and if the borrower defaults\nthe lender can seize the property and resell it.\n\nNow we all know there are particular complications with that in deals in Indian\nCountry. Nonetheless federal law does allow for the use of assets in\ncollateralization. So the point here is these are \u2013 This is a description of\nvarious types of obligations, some which you want to protect the tribe against,\nand some which the lenders and the investors are going to look specifically\ntowards because some have better guarantees than others. Next slide.\n\nA few bond basics. Bonds are more commonly used for long-term financing of\nlarger, more costly capital improvement projects. They typically have longer\nterms but they can match some loan terms up to 20 years typically. And those\nlonger terms lower annual debt service, but when you look over the life of the\nfinancing typically they require a greater all-in-cost of financing. So that may\nbe an advantage to the particular project depending upon how much revenue it's\ngoing to throw off.\n\nNow tax-exempt investors are typically comfortable with longer term, smaller\nsize bond deals, but the slight premium on smaller deals in the area of $10\nmillion to $15 million. But again that's going to be an issue for bond investors\nin the tax-exempt space is the actual size of the project. So remember my first\nslide. Who you're talking to depends upon how the project is sized and scoped.\nNext slide.\n\nA few tax-exempt debt basics because this is critically important to Indian\nCountry. Tribes are eligible to issue tax-exempt debt as are Section 17\ncorporations chartered under Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act.\nTypically and traditionally tribal governments have been limited to issuing\ntax-exempt debt only if the proceeds of the financing would be used for an\nessential government function as defined by the IRS. And the IRS has interpreted\nthat very narrowly. Excluding items; the state and local governments can\ntraditionally finance on a tax-exempt basis such as hotels, golf courses,\nconvention centers, parking garages, and related infrastructure. Next slide.\n\nPrivate Letter Rulings are available for tribal energy projects treating debt as\ntax-exempt. A note of caution here: the IRS has scrutinized several tribal\ntax-exempt financing transactions that state and local governments would\ntraditionally have been able to finance on a tax-exempt basis. And as a result\ntribes are traditionally forced back into either financed projects that would be\ntax-exempt for a municipality using taxable debt, or obtain a Private Letter\nRuling or leverage other funding sources \u2013 again the reason why we gave you the\nresource links to our funding sources. Next slide.\n\nSo now we start to dive into what these people are thinking as you approach them\nwith your pitch. And what the pitch is actually all about in terms of the\nproject. We're going to talk a little bit about the lenders' perspective versus\nthe equity investors. Debt providers \u2013 banks and bond holders \u2013 provide more\naffordable capital. In other words they're seeking to get a smaller rate of\nreturn out of the deal. But in exchange for that they want little or no risk.\n\nThe lenders look for contracts that shift risk to somebody with a deeper pocket\nand a risk appetite such as a utility or a well-established business whether\nit's the tribe's business or another business that can provide a guarantee.\nEquity providers by contrast take the greatest risk by getting compensated by\ngetting the cash available after paying project costs and debt. So that includes\na higher rate of return or return on investment. Next slide.\n\nBasic requirements of lenders have in these deals is the base case flow model\nthat shows debt will be repaid on schedule and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio\nrequirements are satisfied. That typically requires a set of sensitivity or\nreasonable downside cases showing the impact on debt repayment and that Debt\nService Coverage Ratio if things don't go according to plan. And these models\nmust conform to the cash flow waterfall we call it which is how it goes from\ngross to net and those Debt Service Coverage Ratio covenants that are in all of\nthe loan agreements. Next slide.\n\nSo when it comes to the pitch the project team \u2013 the folks making the pitch \u2013\nhave to be able to master this finance language. They have to at least be able\nto be conversant about it and express it in terms of why the project makes\nsense. The project team has to be able to clearly forecast future cash\ngeneration performance, identifying key project and industry variables that\ndrive those forecasts.\n\nAnd the important note here: this is not just simple accounting focusing on\nhistorical and current performance. This is modeling. And as the last slide\nshowed you it's modeling that includes what happens if things don't go according\nto plan. Next slide.\n\nSo a working knowledge of some of the key industry factors is critical for the\nproject team in making the pitch whether it's a direct part of the initial\npresentation or the ability to respond and the kinds of questions that people\nbringing money to the table are going to ask. And those key industry factors\ninclude permitting and construction costs and timelines, technology costs and\nperformance, operating costs, regulated utility allowable costs and revenue if\nthat's a factor in the project.\n\nConversely merchant market price forecasting if that is a factor I the project\nand sales and fuel contract review and interpretation. This is just a sample of\nthe kind of industry knowledge that the team is going to need. Next slide.\n\nMarket trends. Now it can be debated how well the economy is recovered. But as\nthe economy slowly improves credit and capital markets have stabilized. And I\nthink we're going to continue to see that. But in many areas credit is still\nvery tight. Strong tribal credits have access to less expensive bank debt. And\nwhat that means in other words is putting for the best credit the tribe has to\nsecure the least cost of project financing.\n\nLenders providing loans to fund tribal enterprises are increasingly looking to\ntribal government to guarantee that debt. And we'll talk a little bit more about\nthat and how that usually shows up in the deal as we go forward. Next slide.\n\nSo planning the pitch is absolutely fundamental. Identifying the optimal\nfinancing structure to fund energy development should be based on a well thought\nthrough process and a simple to understand process, and overall capital\nimprovement or economic development. And even if the tribe has sufficient funds\nto directly invest in a business opportunity borrowing may allow the tribe to\nearn a higher rate of return on its money that it could get in investments\nelsewhere.\n\nYou know I'm pretty old school and I believe in having no debt if I can, or at\nleast keeping the debt as low as it can possibly be. And fiscally responsible\nprudent practice involves that concept. That being said and a lot of tribes\nunderstand that and a lot of tribal businesses have operated very well on that\nconcept. But that may not mean that the best way to go about financing the\nproject is to use a lot of \u2013 is to exchange your own capital for debt because\nthe debt may actually allow you over time to finance the project cheaper and\nmake more money. Next slide.\n\nSo again the project \u2013 Evaluate the project within the context of the overall\ncapital improvement or economic development plan the tribe has. And if they do\nnot have that we talk to our technical assistance provider. We help tribes with\nstrategic energy planning. Oftentimes a strategic energy plan is not just a\nsimple document that says where's the generation, where's the transmission, and\nwhat do you \u2013? You know how are you going to use your fuel resources?\n\nIt involves other types of economic development opportunities and activities\neither supporting that energy or that could be used \u2013 that benefit from the\nenergy project such as even a new road across the reservation that may help\nreduce fuel use and provide access to expand other businesses. And the point\nhere is that having your pitch, having your proposal in the context of a well\nthought through plan can really help it go forward. And people listening to this\nare going to want to understand a couple of key issues.\n\nWil the project generate revenues? Will the project generate enough money to\ncover the debt service we just talked about? And are there other assets of the\ntribe that can be pledged to improve the financing terms? In other words make it\nmore favorable for everybody in the deal. Next slide.\n\nThe goal of that kind of plan should be for tribal counsel and tribal members to\nillustrate, explain, and justify the costs and the benefits in pursing an\ninvestment in tribal energy and the rationale for the proposed financing\nstructure. Those two key components are essential. Next slide.\n\nA couple of notes on some financing legal issues: it's absolutely essential for\nthe pitch and the proposal to be transparent in terms of the appropriate\nauthorization for the project to go forward pursuant to tribal law required for\nany borrowing and for any other parts of the deal that are going to be required\nsuch as a waiver of sovereign immunity. And that appropriate and transparent\nauthorization is critical for the deal to be valid and to demonstrate how it is\ndone in accordance with applicable tribal law.\n\nWe're seeing that lenders' counsel in particular are now scrutinizing tribal law\nmuch more closely than they used to. And we're seeing lenders' counsel bringing\non Indian law experts to help them understand that. The lenders \u2013 the point is \u2013\nusually want to specify a familiar body of law for the overall functioning of\nthe finance such as laws in the state in which the tribe is located. Oftentimes\nthe laws of the State of New York are traditional done because financing\nsyndicates come out of a lot of big banks based in New York.\n\nThe bottom line is you're going to have both tribal law necessary to make sure\nthat the deal is authorized. And you'll typically see another state law for\nbringing significant resourced governing the transaction and the particular deal\npoints in the transaction. Next slide. Lenders \u2013 we've seen this happen with\nmore frequency \u2013 may request that the tribe adopt certain laws or code\ncompatible with state law such as an arbitration code or uniform commercial code\nto govern security interests in personal property.\n\nNow this is not going to be a deal point in a small deal \u2013 typically a community\nscale project. As you start getting into greater refinancing and greater \u2013 in\nnew ventures the risk may go up. We're seeing lenders actually move into this\narea and asking tribes to adopt at least a version of these commercial codes or\ncertain components of them to be consistent with state law. Next slide.\n\nSo one last thing that is also very critical is you know not all borrowers wear\nthe same hats. And it's the investors and the lenders and the folks bringing\nmoney to the table are going to need to know is the borrower the tribe? And how\nis that organized? And who is responsible for making decisions? Or is it a\ntribal instrumentality or authority such as an economic development authority or\nhousing authority? And where does that decision making flow back to \u2013 tribal\ncouncil or has it been delegated to that entity?\n\nIt may be \u2013 This is a little less common. It may be a political subdivision or\nan unincorporated instrumentality of the tribe, not a separate legal entity from\nthe tribe. We're seeing more and more tribes move into the area of establishing\ntribal corporations under tribal law, tribally-charted corporations, or\nfederally-chartered corporations such as the Section 17. And we've talked about\nthat number of times on our webinar series.\n\nAnd there are times when an LLC or even a state-chartered corporation may be\nable to create greater access and particularly to state subsidies and\nstate-backed or guaranteed revenues that you couldn't get without a\nstate-chartered entity in the deal. Next slide.\n\nSo that is my primer. Again think back to the three points I made on the slide\nthat we'll post. It goes to knowing your audience and knowing a little bit about\nwhat kind of money these people are bringing to the table. Are they seeking low\nrisk like debt providers or lenders will? Are they willing to take higher risk\nand seek a greater rate of return? But also have you worked these fundamentals\ninto your project concept, into your executive summary and your pitch?\n\nAnd are you presenting it through a project team that can demonstrate without\nhaving to go into great detail that they have the expertise and the experience\nto pull it off? Wrap those elements into your pitch; you're going to be\nsuccessful. And again whether you're able to attend our National Tribal Energy\nSummit May 1st through 3rd here at the JW Marriott downtown DC and use this\ninformation to think about your project pitch. Or if you're not able to attend\nthe Summit this information is critical for project finance.\n\nAnd if we don't get time to answer all of the questions today I'm happy to\nfollow up with anybody. You can contact me here by e-mail or the best number is\nby cell. So I thank you for the time and I'll turn it back to Randy so we can\nhear from Scott Geary on the fundamentals of the actual pitch.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you Doug, excellent. And Scott just give me a\nmoment to pull your deck back up. And you're good to go.\n\nScott Geary:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great, thank you Randy. Doug, that was very\ninformative; thanks so much. I'm coming at this from a slightly different\nperspective and I wanted to comment just as energy project development is quite\ncomplex multidisciplinary in terms of finance, engineering, construction,\nenvironmental, _____, and maintenance, et cetera, I look at the pitch also as a\nmulti-phased process. You mentioned a starting point of an executive summary\nwhich we typically used to get kicked off.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And it allows you to get in the door to give\nyour pitch. If you make it through the pitch then we get into the complexities\nand due diligence which tend to focus primarily on the financials. First slide\nplease Randy or next slide I should say.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So what is the purpose of the pitch? I\nreally look at it as once you get in the door you're trying to build a\nrelationship. You want to engage the audience, get them excited. You can start\nout with a vision. Get everybody open-minded. And remember I have a bit of a\nSilicon Valley perspective. I've lived out here for many, many years. And you'll\nsee part of this how to pitch is geared towards that audience.\n\nThe idea is you need to express your idea and your vision with clarity and\nfocus. Build the relationship, leave your audience wanting more, and try to do\nit in a concise 10-15 slide deck. The purpose of the pitch is not to close the\ndeal that day. It's not to answer all the questions. It's just to get everybody\non board. Next slide.\n\nThe common mistakes we see are too many slides, too many details, unsupportable\nassumptions, and too much criticism of competition, and an arrogance that plays\nto these. Why your competition is so awful and why you're going to be so much\nbetter assumptions, ridiculous growth assumptions or assuming away costs that\ndon't exist, or assuming that there won't be lots of hurdles in your way.\n\nWe have a well-known speaker and venture capitalist in Silicon Valley named Guy\nKawasaki. He's got a firm called Garage Ventures. And I don't agree entirely\nwith his concept but he has boiled it down. He says when you're doing a pitch\nit's 10 slides, 20 minutes, and use big font so you can't put too much on a\nslide. Next slide please.\n\nAn outline of a pitch in Guy Kawasaki's opinion or many other folks out here\nit's broken down into ten components. The elevator portion, problem solution,\nmarket, again et cetera. And I'll get into these. I won't read them all but\nbefore you get to the pitch how do you get into the pitch room? Next slide.\n\nSo I work with the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in Philadelphia,\nMississippi. I work with economic development there. They get a very high volume\nof proposals and it gets difficult to sort through. Proposals come from\neverywhere and anywhere. They come from friends of the tribal council. They come\nfrom tribal members. They come from the public. And it is actually quite\noverwhelming. Next slide.\n\nSo we need to take all of these various ideas and decide who we're going to\nallow to pitch to us. So we have \u2013 I'll call it \u2013 an ideal funnel or a proposal\nfunnel that has multiple stages. And at each stage it requires us to put\nadditional time, money, effort, diligence into these things. So we try to screen\nout poor ideas right off the bat. And as they make it through the process we can\ncommit more and more resources to it. We begin with a very simple intake tool.\nAnd I'm not going to get into the details. If anyone has specific questions I'm\nhappy to walk people through this. Next slide please.\n\nIn order for us to get to the beginning of the funnel in the evaluation process\nwe have the fill out a simple form online. It's an online screen. Who are you?\nHow did you hear about the tribe? Give us a little bit of an idea of what you're\ntalking about. What stage is your business in? And is it ready for market now or\nis it a year or two out? We get into intellectual property questions. Try to\nestimate the market size, and try to understand if there is a valid market,\nexisting competitors, and what do they want to talk to us about?\n\nDo they want an equity investment? Do they want a factory to run out of? Do they\nwant depth, a partnership? Do they want to act as government contracts, et\ncetera? So we take a look at these \u2013 next slide please \u2013 and we score them. We\nscore all these different fundamentals. And we say what's important to us at the\ntribe? I've got 50 ideas came through the door. Where did the idea come from?\nWho brought it to the table? And that is important. And Doug mentioned that as\nwell.\n\nWhere is the deal coming from, and the management team? A lot of times you're\njust purely looking at economics. Is this just going to be the highest return on\nour investment? Or maybe it's not the highest return but maybe it's going to\ndrive employment. Or, number five, we're going to be able to utilize unused\nbuildings or right-of-ways or thoroughfares or unused biomass resources, biomass\nenergy projects for example. And then we want to take a look at how risky this\nis, what stage you're at of course.\n\nDoug touched on the different ownership issues and a big one that's starting to\ncome up now is the social impact. So are we providing economic diversity and\nenergy sovereignty for example on the energy projects? Next slide please.\n\nBack to the outline of the pitch, I'm going to try to run through this\nrelatively quickly. Again this is much more geared towards economic development.\nA lot of it pitching to equity investors and a lot of what we see out here in\nSilicon Valley. Where I could I have plugged in examples from an equity pitch\nthat we all are familiar with \u2013 AIRBNB. You may not be familiar with the pitch\nbut certainly the company. They have come up with \u2013 Well their first pitch was\nin 2009.\n\nIt was a very elegant, simple, successful pitch. And with that I'll go to the\nnext slide and we'll talk about the elevator pitch. If you haven't heard of it\nwhat's an elevator pitch? You've got a limited \u2013 You've got 10 to 30 seconds to\nexplain to somebody what your idea, vision, and mission is. I like to say if you\nfind yourself in an elevator with Elon Musk and you've got an idea how are you\ngoing to quickly get that across? It needs to be short. It needs to be\nmemorable. It needs to leave the listener intrigued and curious. And it needs to\nbe relatable.\n\nI dropped one in here: the Uber of food delivery. If you're making too big of a\nstretch it sounds tacky but anyway. Next slide please. In this you'll see I've\ngot a couple of things. I've got some taglines and I've got the elevator pitch.\nSometimes they can be interchangeable. This actually is from the AIRBNB slide\ndeck. They had a 14 page slide deck. The first one you'll notice they made some\n\u2013 You know what is this? AIRBNB is a fun approach to coach surfing.\n\nThink of it as Craigslist meets Hotels.com but a lot less creepy. Again, a cool\nalternative to a boring evening in a hotel room. AIRBNB was basically trying to\nsolve a problem with a great profitable solution. Next slide please.\n\nWe then wanted to find what is the problem? So what real problem are you\nsolving? Why does it exist? What are your customer pain points? And when\npossible we like to make that personal. We really like to tell a story.\nStorytelling is the new form of currency out here. It helps people get engaged.\nAnd it gets you to the next level where you can get into the nitty-gritty of\nfinancials and due diligence. Next slide please.\n\nIn AIRBNB's case the problem \u2013 again a very elegant slide deck. Price is an\nissue. They wanted to do it. Hotels \u2013 when you stay in hotels you're\ndisconnected from the culture in the city. And it was very difficult up to that\npoint to overcome that and try to connect with locals and book a local room. So\nAIRBNB came with a solution. Next slide please.\n\nSo in your solutions portion of your pitch deck it's what's your value\nproposition? What are you doing? You've defined what the customer pain points\nare. But how do you relieve these? Typically when we think of a solution we\nthink of something that is more convenient, more efficient, or cheaper. Again\nideally in this case we're pitching ideas to our economic development group for\nexample.\n\nWe love to see anything \u2013 anything real, anything we can put our hands on, and\nanything like sketches. I've raised various rounds of venture capital literally\nwith sketches of products. Don\u2019t underestimate the value in that. Next slide\nplease.\n\nAIRBNB's solution: again very elegantly done. A web-based platform: save money,\nmake money, share culture. They really boiled it down. I wish I was as smart as\nwhoever built this deck. It's absolutely beautiful. Next part of the pitch is\nthe market. Next slide please.\n\nThe market is a big one. This is where you show your audience that you really\nknow what you're talking about. You've done the research. You know what the\nexisting market looks like. You know how it's segmented. You know how big it is.\nYou know what business you're in. You demonstrate knowledge of the market.\nYou've defined your market. You understand the total available market size. You\nunderstand how big it can get and its growth rates. And you understand where you\nplay in it. You understand the addressable market \u2013 the target market.\n\nAnd you understand how you're going to get into the market. Who are your\nbeachhead customers? Do you knock those down and then start getting the ones\nnext to it? Big on visuals here \u2013 I think it really communicates the concepts\nquickly, easily. And again I think actually this plays into any pitch. And I\nthink it plays in primarily financials as well across any project whether it's\nenergy or whatnot. I do like to do some of the visualizations that we're seeing\nmore and more of. They're very elegant. Next slide please.\n\nAgain these are the slides that AIRBNB used to show that there was validation to\ntheir market. They noticed by looking at Craigslist for example there were\n50,000 listings for temporary housing. And again this was back in the '09\ntimeframe. And coach surfing had little over 500,000 million users at that time.\nSo there was a need for it. I don't love Slide 5 but again it gets into the\nmarket size: 2 billion+ trips books. There's the budget of $560 million, and\ntrips with AIRBNB 84 million. Next slide please.\n\nThe next slide we get into the product. And again storytelling: boil it down to\na person if you can. We want to know who that customer is and how they value and\nhow they use the product. And why are they going to use it more than once?\nThat's slide Number 6 is what AIRBNB used. Again at this point 2009 it was\npretty ahead of the game. It was nice and visual, had great search\nfunctionality. It allowed you to move through quickly and book things quickly.\nAnd as they went along they built then more features of course. Next slide.\n\nWe'll get into the business model. So we want to start thinking about how we're\ngoing to make money, a little continuation of the product and who the customers\nare. Define your customers. Quantify your potential customers, and segment them\nout from your beachhead customers that you're going to attack and how you're\ngoing to start knocking over additional markets. Understand the price points in\nthe market and what customers are willing to pay.\n\nMost of us have seen Shark Tank on TV. They always nail these entrepreneurs on\nhey you've been around for one month or five years. What's your revenue to date?\nAnd if it doesn't meet some acceptable floor, and growth rate and adoption they\ntell them to go take a hike. So if you have some history that's great. Next\nslide is actually AIRBNB's slide. So theirs is very simple. They take ten\npercent commission on each transaction with $84 million dollars' worth of trips.\nAgain they were projecting on a $2.1 billion revenue. Next slide please.\n\nAgain following product business, business model, customers. Where are your\ncustomers today? And where are they looking? What are the channels your\ncompetition is using? And how are you going to be a little more innovative? You\nmay want to repeat some of the same channels but how are you going to do it\ndifferently? Tell me why you're going to do it better. Next slide please.\n\nAgain big fan of digitalization across the board; I think it communicates ideas\nquickly. This is competition differentiation. Where do I sit? Where do I exist?\nYou'll notice that AIRBNB used a slide deck that basically said you know we're\nthe most convenient and the most affordable. We're up on the upper right\nquadrant. I guess this goes back to sort of the traditional BCG matrix with the\nstarts up on the right corner. And also you map in where your competition is.\nAnother way to do it is the matrix on the right, the competitive landscape which\nis listing all your competitors and different attributes and how you stack up.\nNext slide please.\n\nAnother view, perceptual maps, and consumer perception \u2013 what are your\nadvantages and what are your perceived advantages in the market? Advantages: of\ncourse patents or intellectual property. Do you have any unfair advantages? Do\nwe have any unfair advantages being tribal entities? Do we have some advantages\ngetting the government contracts? Can we get the \u2013? For example can we get the\nmilitary to agree to let us product power over the fence and export to them? How\ndo we take advantage of these things? Unfair advantages: again location we put\non there, experience. Next slide please.\n\nWe'll show AIRBNB's original competitive advantage slide \u2013 Slide Number 10 of\ntheir deck. What were they claiming their competitive advantage was? They were\nfirst to market in transaction based temporary housing. They allowed people with\nhomes to make money. The host didn't have to keep relisting, relisting with\nCraigslist. It was very easy to use, great profiles, and again eventually\nfeedback profiles as well. And I don't know if you'll agree but looking at this\nincredibly simple slide deck it's really elegant. It\u2019s a great design. Next\nslide please.\n\nAnd that design cascaded over into who's on the team. I think what Doug said is\nvery important. Who's on the team? From an energy standpoint have you done this\nbefore? Is there prior success? Do you have expertise? And if so what's the\nexperience? AIRBNB we've got a user interface person who understands how people\nperceive and how they perceive design and what's friendly. You've got a backend\nguy who makes it all work. And you've got somebody up front doing the biz dev\nand branding.\n\nPulling it back to energy projects in Indian Country if you don't have the right\nexperience try to get someone in the room with you. Try to get them on your\nboard of advisors or board of directors or \u2013 Well board of directors gets _____\nin Indian Country as well. But team matters. Next slide.\n\nWe're coming closer to the end here. Financials \u2013 this as I think Doug was\nsaying as well is really audience-dependent. I tend to do and expect a high\nlevel finance at this point. And if it passes the smell test if you will then we\ndo a follow up. And then we get into the nitty-gritty. And we get into in the\nmiddle section here \u2013 If it's an existing business let's take a look at some\nhistorical highlights. I'm going to want to get into your financial projects,\ninto your Proformas. The critical assumptions whether it's for startup or\nwhether it's for an energy project.\n\nAssumptions matter. We want to understand that you have any idea what you're\ntalking about. We want to understand that you're reasonable. We want to\nunderstand that you understand your cash flow, your burn rate, where you're at\nfor break even in terms of cost and timing. And again to do this right is not\ntrivial. It does require a reasonably high degree of expertise. And depending on\nhow you structure the deal legally and financially it has huge impacts on what\nthese numbers look like. I won't get into the details there. Next slide please.\n\nJust to finish out the presentation that was the last slide for AIRBNB's deck\nwhich they were successful in raising money. They're a little too simple there\nbut again it's not an energy project. And then finally next slide: some\nreferences here if you're interested in pitch decks. You will Google on Dave\nMcClure's 500 Startups is fantastic. Guy Kawasaki is a real icon out here. And\nAirBnB pitch deck is incredibly elegant. Maybe not so relevant for energy but\nreally in a way it is.\n\nIt demonstrates a clarity of thought. And I think it does a nice job of getting\nthe audience comfortable moving to the next level. The next slide will be a\nlittle bit of a shocker. Next slide please. So this is not a slide that you\nwould put in a pitch deck or a slide deck. This is an energy development\nproject. It's actually a real project that I did. This is a personal way that I\nmap out the crazy variables in a project. It's not something I share. But I\nwanted to point out that an energy development project has hundreds and\nthousands of variables.\n\nAnd you have to get them all right. If you get one wrong the project doesn't go.\nBut it does all hinge on the most important piece which is \u2013 again as Doug\nmentioned \u2013 the financials. And it's the risk management related to that. And I\nwould like to offer up anybody on the call who's not interested in again the\nmore fluffy pitch deck that we just ran through. If you want to get into the\nnitty-gritty I'm happy to walk people through how to do energy project\ndevelopment.\n\nIf you actually take a close look at this particular slide again you'll notice\nit's a multidisciplinary approach. You've got your finance. You've got your\nconstruction and environmental operations, and maintenance. This happened to be\na gas project so it required negotiations with waste management, with the town.\nAnd this was also for export so it also required negotiation with SoCal Edison\nor Interconnects. How a purchase agreement which is what allowed us to move\nforward on the financing of this.\n\nWe basically had a guarantee from a city \u2013 in this case the City of Anaheim \u2013\nthat said we will guarantee that we'll buy power from you. We're a good\ncustomer. We're rated. And of course that allows you to go get your bond\nfinancing and your bank financing and your equity financing. That's about it. We\nwrapped it up right there. So again I'm happy to walk anyone through the\nspecifics on energy development. And I hope the pitch portion was interesting or\nhelpful.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you Scott. And let's go into the Q&A portion of\nthe event. Let's see what questions we have out there right now. And I would\nlike to remind everyone you can submit written questions by clicking on the\nquestion button in the control tab and writing your question. Or you can raise\nyour hand. There are no written questions at this time. Let's see if there are\nany attendees that would like to ask our panel a question directly. If you do\njust click the raise your hand icon and I will unmute you so you can ask our\npanel your question directly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And it looks like there is a raised hand.\nChu Charn Tan I'm going to unmute you at this time so you can ask your question\nto the panel directly. Go ahead Chu. Chu Charn Tan you've been unmuted if you\nwant to ask our panelists a question directly. We can't seem to hear you so I'll\nmute you again. Just raise your hand again if you get your audio fixed. Let's\nsee there may be some other written questions.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will both Scott and Doug be at the Summit?\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will this is Doug and yes you'll get an opportunity to\nmeet and network and talk to both of us. This year we engaged Scott Geary and\nStone Angel Capital to be an integral part of the Summit in helping us prepare\nthe finance tracks. For those of you who have looked at the agenda or those who\naren't familiar with this year's Summit we've organized it around the four\npolicy priorities that were prepared and delivered to the Secretary of Energy by\nthe Indian Country Energy Infrastructure Working Group.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the first of those by priority is access\nto capital. So Scott has been instrumental in working with his investor and\nfinance industry contacts to pull together not only the finance roundtable on\nthe afternoon of May 1st but each of the financing and access to capital tracks\non May 2nd and 3rd. And we both plan to attend the matchmaking or make your\npitch sessions. So we're really happy to have Scott here. Scott, anything you\nwanted to add?\n\nScott Geary:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well thanks Doug. I appreciate it. And of course I've\nenjoyed working Indian Country and working on all the important projects related\nthereof. I would just say we've got a nice lineup of speakers. I'm looking\nforward to getting a lot of smart, curious people in the rooms, and try to\nfigure out how we can take advantage of this massive market of Indian energy. I\nreally look forward to the networking session Tuesday afternoon from 4:45 PM to\n6:00 PM which was sponsored by a developer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So we'll have some beer, wine, and finger\nfood following some great conversation that afternoon and prior to the event at\nthe Smithsonian Museum.\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great. And Scott for our audience one thing I would highly\nrecommend. Tell your colleagues and our friends in Indian Country and all of the\nindustry folks that you work with we'd love to have you. And it's free to the\nfederal government, to tribes, tribal businesses, and tribal representatives.\nThe only folks that have a registration fee are industry. And what we would\nencourage you all to do that haven't done this yet is to register. .The National\nTribal Energy Summit has a webpage on www.energy.gov/indianenergy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And you can navigate to that. The actual\nregistration page is tribalenergysummit@ncsl.org. And NCSL is the National\nConference of State Legislators. And they are helping us once again this 2017 to\nhelp us pull off a successful summit. So please if you're interested register.\nIf you have any trouble with that send us an e-mail. We'll get you connected\nwith the right link.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay. Will you be streaming the presentations for those\nthat can't attend?\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is Doug MacCourt again. We will be streaming the\nplenary presentations on the morning of May 2nd. Due to the fact that these are\nbreakout sessions and four separate tracks we are not going to be streaming each\nindividual track. But we will be streaming the plenary presentations which will\ninclude Secretary Perry and our director Chris Deschene as well as a session\nthat I am introducing Senator Hoeven and Senator Udall of the Senate Committee\non Indian Affairs talking about new directions in energy sovereignty with\ntribes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And we will also be streaming the lunchtime\nremarks from members of Congress and the Senate and the House, but not the\nsessions. We will be collecting the presentation information from the sessions\nand ultimately we do a report out. But it's not the same as being there.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, any tips for pitching to entities not experienced\nin doing business in Indian Country?\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well Scott maybe I'll take a preliminary whack at that. My\nfirst advice is it depends on what you're pitching. If you're talking about\npitching an energy project and particularly a clean energy project that uses the\nkind of financing that I described \u2013 the tax equity model, familiarity with that\nis important as we talked about. But also first it's absolutely essential to\nunderstand what specific type of investor you're talking to and you're pitching\nto. And we covered the issues of a certain background in the fundamentals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But if you're talking to investors on behalf\nof a tribe or with an interest in doing projects in Indian Country I strongly\nrecommend that you bring them to the table. And it doesn't necessarily require\nthat if you're with a company \u2013 Let's say you're with a development company or\nyou're with a technology company. It's less important that you have experience\nin Indian Country \u2013 although that certainly helps \u2013 than it is to have the clear\nsupport and fundamentals of the tribe and who's going to be represented in the\npresentation, in the pitch, and have that be succinct and transparent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hope I at least answered part of the\nquestion. Scott?\n\nScott Geary:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure. Great question. It immediately draws me to one\nof your slide Doug on the banking side for example. And we will have some\nbankers at the Summit on panels answering similar questions. 'Cause a bank has\nto worry about if I'm going \u2013 Let's say I'm going to loan money to an Indian\nentity. How is my loan secured? And is it secured against assets? And if it's\nsecured against assets through \u2013 The standard way we do a Uniform Commercial\nCode 1. We file a lien. But how does that work in Indian Country? And how do I\nanswer that question if I'm not familiar with it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I think depending on who the audience and\ninvestor is, whether it's an equity or a debt, whether it's a BC or private\nequity there are certainly plenty of nuances around the legal side of that and\nthe corporate structure and security issues, et cetera. I'd be happy to get into\nsome of those details with anybody maybe off this call. I think it's very\nspecific to who you're talking to and what type of project you're talking about.\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's absolutely right. And again for those of you in the\naudience that are going to be attending the Summit you'll see us there all three\ndays. Just come up to us, introduce yourselves, and if you're not able to attend\nsend us an e-mail. You've got our contact information.\n\nScott Geary:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I should say part of this is actually starting to\neducate the larger ecosystem if you will of these nuances. And can we template\nthis to some degree based on the type of projects so various investors can see\nokay I've got issue one, two, and three. And this is how they're dealt with. But\nagain we'll have a nice set of representatives at this particular conference.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay and seeing no more written questions and no hands\nraised I think we'll conclude the webinar today. As this slide states a\npost-webinar e-mail will be sent to all those that attended the webinar. And\nthose that did not with this link that's shown on the screen that's where the\nrecording and the PowerPoints will be located. And we'll make sure to post\nDoug's most current PowerPoint that we weren't able to get into the webinar\ntoday. I'm also going to go to a list of upcoming webinars.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next one is Spending Energy Dollars\nWisely on May 31st. And with that again I want to thank our speakers: Lizana\nPierce, Doug MacCourt, and Scott Geary for doing a great job today. I hope you\ncan all make it to the National Tribal Summit. And with that have a great day.\nThank you.\n\nDoug MacCourt:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you Randy.\n\nRandy Manion:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bye everyone.\n\nScott Geary:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bye.\n\n[End of Audio]",

        "link": "https://www.elitedaily.com/lifestyle/best-friend-meeting-app-reviews",
        "content": "I\u2019d always been a Florida gworl. Born and raised in Jacksonville, I had a\ntight-knit circle of friends who were, shocker, also based in Florida. But in\n2021, I decided to trade in my flip-flops for cowboy boots to move to Houston,\nTexas, a casual 800-plus miles away from home. My then-partner \u2014 whom I started\ndating a month before the panini and Miss Rona did their thing \u2014 already lived\nthere, so that was one little nugget in the city\u2019s favor; it was also a chance\nto really change things up. The thing I was most nervous about was finding a new\ntribe. Making friends as an adult is hard! But now, nearly two years since I\nmade The Big Move\u2122, I finally found one really fun way to meet new people and\n(hopefully) make new friends in the process: apps.\n\nAlthough relationship-building apps are far from a new concept, dating apps and\nI have historically gone together like Rihanna and new music \u2014 it\u2019s just not\nhappening right now \u2014 so I\u2019d never considered friendship apps until recently.\nWorking remotely doesn\u2019t allow for much socialization during normal business\nhours, and meeting new people IRL after work or on weekends isn\u2019t as easy as it\nwas pre-2020. Trying out friend-meeting apps from the comfort of my couch seemed\nlike a more stress-free option than, say, going outside, so I took the plunge\nwithout too many reservations.\n\nOver the course of five weeks, I tested out five different popular apps to find\nfriends \u2014 Bumble BFF, Hey! VINA, Nextdoor, Clockout, and Wink \u2014 to see which\nones are actually the best for expanding your social circle. As I experimented\nwith a different app each week, I considered everything from how easy they were\nto use (FYI, if you\u2019re familiar with Tinder\u2019s interface, you\u2019ll have no problem\nnavigating most of these) to how it pairs you up with another person. Below,\nyou\u2019ll find my reviews and ratings for each so you can decide whether you, too,\nshould try finding your new community with just a few taps or swipes on your\nphone.\n\n\nBUMBLE BFF\n\n\n\nBumble BFF\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Bumble BFF?\n\nBumble isn\u2019t just a top-five dating app \u2014 it\u2019s a friendship game-changer, too.\nIts Bumble BFF mode allows all users to send messages in hopes of making matches\nfor platonic relationships.\n\nPros:\n\nOne of the best things Bumble has going for it is its diverse pool of users.\nAccording to Apple, \u201cSome 50 million people have used [Bumble] to not only find\na date but also make friends.\u201d That means literally millions of potential\nbesties from varying backgrounds. You can\u2019t help but stan. The app also allows\nusers to verify their profiles \u2014 similar to Instagram and Twitter (before the\nwhole Twitter Blue fiasco) \u2014 making it easier to prevent potential catfish. I\nlove the profile prompts on Bumble, because they\u2019re short, sweet, and to the\npoint (i.e., \u201cMy real-life superpower is...,\u201d \u201cAfter work you can find me...\u201d).\nMany users also keep their Bumble profiles fairly simple, so you can spend more\ntime getting to know each other once you swipe right instead of worrying too\nmuch about listing all your interests within a 300-character limit.\n\nCons:\n\nBumble BFF matches will expire after a message was sent if the other party\ndoesn\u2019t respond within 24 hours \u2014 but there\u2019s an option to re-match with users,\nso you shouldn\u2019t run into any \u201cone that got away\u201d situations. One issue I did\nrun into was that most of my matches seemed more interested in continuing to\nchat through the app rather than meeting in person. As someone looking to make\nsome IRL connections, I felt a bit discouraged by others not wanting to take\nthat next step.\n\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 4/5\n\nBumble BFF seems like a solid way to make new connections, especially in an\never-growing millennial hot spot like Houston. While I had more than a few\nmatches that didn\u2019t end up leading anywhere beyond a few back-and-forth\nmessages, others were eager to get to know each other and make IRL plans. In\nfact, I went out for drinks with a Bumble BFF user within 48 hours of swiping\nright! A quick and easy way to meet new people (and possibly new friends)? You\nlove to see it.\n\n\nWINK\n\n\n\nWink\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Wink?\n\nWink regards itself as the \u201cbest place to make new friends from all over the\nworld.\u201d Like Bumble, you can use the app to potentially find love interests and\nnew friends. The difference with Wink \u2014 which is often referred to as \u201cTinder\nfor friends\u201d \u2014 is that you\u2019re able to link it to your Snapchat account. Once you\nexchange Snap info with a Wink match, all your interactions go through SC\ninstead.\n\nPros:\n\nThe best thing I found was that it was easy to navigate; the interface feels\nvery Tinder-esque with its swipe-based feature, allowing for almost effortless\nusage.\n\nCons:\n\nFrom the get-go, I noticed the app didn\u2019t have personalized prompts to answer\nfor your profile; just straightforward info about yourself (name, location,\netc.). It also almost feels like Wink is an extension of Snapchat, which I\u2019m\nsure is a plus for some people, but not so much for me. I deleted Snapchat years\nago, so using Wink felt like a step backward. Though I was able to log on to the\napp without a Snapchat account, with users constantly asking for my Snap info,\nit just didn\u2019t seem worth it to continue.\n\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 2/5\n\nNot having any personalized prompts when you\u2019re trying to forge new\nrelationships didn\u2019t sit well with me from the beginning. Plus, the Snapchat of\nit all also didn\u2019t lend itself to a great experience for me, a non-Snapchat\nuser. Even disregarding all of that, I didn\u2019t end up chatting with anyone on\nWink that seemed interested in meeting up in person. A few exchanges actually\ngave big catfish vibes, since they were so insistent on keeping convos on the\napp. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t consider it the best place to meet your next forever\nfriend.\n\n\nCLOCKOUT\n\n\n\nClockout\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Clockout?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a potential business partner or new work bestie, this app\ncould be your new go-to. \u201cMade specifically for post-grads and young\nprofessionals,\u201d Clockout aims to provide a way to plug in with your peers that\nmay work in a similar field. You can also find local workshops, seminars, or\npanels in your area.\n\nPros:\n\nWork-life balance can be rough. (I WFH, so I know this all too well.) Since\nClockout matches you with people who have similar career trajectories \u2014 using\nthe swipe feature \u00e0 la Tinder \u2014 it was nice to have opps to chat with others who\nI have something in common with, can network with, and even vent to about the\ndaily grind one day.\n\nCons:\n\nThe profile setup is pretty lengthy, so you\u2019ll need to set some time aside to\nget everything up and running. As you\u2019re answering the prompts, you\u2019ll notice\nthat the app \u2014 which currently has 60,000 members \u2014 is solely dependent on your\nprofessional life and less focused on your personality, so you better like the\npeople in your field. A perfect example is my first match, who asked me a bunch\nof questions about my professional life rather than about topics that weren\u2019t\nwork-related. This wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but there\u2019s so much more to\nme than my job.\n\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 3/5\n\nIt\u2019s giving... LinkedIn. Clockout appears to be less of a place to make lifelong\nfriends and more of a place to chat with fellow young professionals. And with a\nlimited amount of members, there isn\u2019t that much variety (yet), which could be\nan issue for those in smaller cities. I\u2019m in one of the largest cities in the\nU.S., and I still found it lacking.\n\n\nHEY! VINA\n\n\n\nHey! VINA\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Hey! VINA?\n\nThe concept of Hey! VINA is simple: It\u2019s for women, by women. Self-described as\n\u201cTinder for (girl) friends,\u201d this women-owned app is currently available in 158\ncountries around the world, with the goal of making it easier to find new\nconnections wherever your heart and wanderlust take you.\n\nPros:\n\nSince it\u2019s a women-owned business, I\u2019d say that the environment feels much\nwarmer and inviting than those of other apps. Just look at these profile\nprompts: \u201cWhat\u2019s your love language?\u201d \u201cAre you an introvert or an extrovert?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the personalization for me. There\u2019s also a \u201cParty\u201d feature that places you\nin a group chat based on your shared interests. The users in my \u201cParty\u201d groups \u2014\nwhich were centered around astrology, music, and TikTok \u2014 were so conversational\nand friendly, I could see how people could gain a whole new friend group from\nthe app.\n\nCons:\n\nAs great as the more detailed prompts are, this means the setup process is a bit\nlonger than other apps\u2019 (mine took about 15 minutes), so you\u2019ll need to set some\nmore time aside to answer questions (like the aforementioned introvert/extravert\nQ) before entering the space. Plus, it only allows you to have one photo of\nyourself on your profile at a time, which is, like... fine, but it doesn\u2019t allow\nyou to physically show your personality as much, so you need your words to shine\neven more. Thank God I\u2019m a writer.\n\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 4.5/5\n\nThe vibes are immaculate. Getting to know people in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like\na dating app is a major yes for me. While it does utilize the swipe right or\nleft feature, it\u2019s much more customized to each individual user, asking\nquestions about yourself in between swipes to get a better understanding of who\nyou are and who you\u2019d pair best with. Fingers crossed I\u2019ll get to meet some of\nmy \u201cParty\u201d people IRL soon!\n\n\nNEXTDOOR\n\n\n\nNextdoor\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Nextdoor?\n\nNextdoor aims to help you to make connections with your neighbors and people in\nyour community. Unlike other meetup apps, there\u2019s no swipe left or right\nfeature. Instead, it feels more like Facebook, a place where you can post\nstatuses about events in your neighborhood or what you\u2019re looking for nearby.\nThink local yard sales, dog walkers, or babysitters.\n\nPros:\n\nThe app is a great way to find things to do in your area and allows you to stay\nplugged into your community, using statuses as ways to engage in conversations\nwith others. (V user-friendly for FB fans.) There\u2019s also the option to buy or\nsell things, with users even giving away items they no longer need \u2014 for free!\nI\u2019m talking free furniture, free tech products, free kittens. You read that\nright: Free. Kittens. Wish I could say I jumped at the opp, but I held back.\n\nCons:\n\nThe multi-step setup process could be a bit confusing, and without a profile\nverification process, it doesn\u2019t feel as safe as other apps. Plus, no swipe\nfeature = more challenging to meet people individually. So, if you\u2019re looking to\nmake friends on this app, it may require a bit more courage, and I just didn\u2019t\nhave that during my trial run.\n\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 2.5/5\n\nAs innovative as it seems, it falls a bit short as a potential friend-meeting\napp; building meaningful connections is just not its specialty. IMO, it\u2019s\ndefinitely worth it if you\u2019re looking to hire someone to provide a service, or\nvice versa.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAfter more than a month of experimenting with friend-meeting apps, here are my\nrankings, from best to worst:\n\n 1. Hey! VINA\n 2. Bumble BFF\n 3. Clockout\n 4. Nextdoor\n 5. Wink\n\nHey! VINA and Bumble BFF proved to be the best options for making connections,\nwith the former juuust edging out the latter. They both focus on *your*\npersonality and *your* interests and have millions of users, so the pools of\npotential besties are incredibly large. Given the welcoming atmosphere of Hey!\nVINA, I actually plan to continue to use it beyond my little experiment; the\nusers I\u2019ve chatted with have been so friendly and open to connecting IRL (once\nall parties are comfortable, of course), so there\u2019s a lot of friendship\npotential.\n\nNextdoor and Clockout focus much less on building interpersonal relationships,\nbut they seem like they\u2019re great for connecting with neighbors or fellow\npost-college grads, should that be your brand. And Wink, oh Wink... the\nTinder-like nature of it just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nFive apps later, I still haven\u2019t found my new tribe yet \u2014 hey, it\u2019s only been a\nmonth \u2014 but in the nearly two years since The Big Move\u2122, I feel like I may just\nbe a few steps closer. And I have a couple of apps to thank for that.",

        "content": "LOOKING AT THE CHICAGO CUBS AND CLEVELAND INDIANS OFFENSIVE MODEL, IT\u2019S CLEAR\nWHY THE NEW YORK METS COULDN\u2019T SCORE RUNS.\n\nWith a season of offensive woe in the rearview mirror, further inspection of the\nNew York Mets collective approach at the plate is due. Better put: it must be\ndone.\n\nThe Mets scored runs via the home run in such a way that baseball elders\nwouldn\u2019t believe. Offensive production was almost solely fueled by the long\nball, a formula too often destined for failure. On May 7, Elias Sports Bureau\ndetermined that the Mets held a league-high 55% of runs scored on home runs. By\nseason\u2019s end, the team was wallowed away at 26th in runs scored.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs, in such a captivating way, scored the league\u2019s third-most runs\nin 2016, while the Cleveland Indians ranked fifth. Yet, as opposed to the Mets\u2019\nhome run slugs which amounted to the fifth-most in the Majors, the Cubs and\nIndians ranked a more modest 13th and 18th, respectively.\n\nThe paradigm sounds ironic, even counterintuitive. But here\u2019s the catch: despite\nthe padding of the home run ball, team slugging in Queens was in the bottom half\nof baseball (16th). The Cubs and Indians both finished in the top ten (again,\neven with the home run difference) in slugging, largely because the Indians hit\nthe third-most doubles in the sport, and the Cubs sixth. The Mets were buried at\nan embarrassing 29th, ahead of only Philadelphia.\n\nAnd, by the way, stolen bases help too; the Tribe swiped 92 more bags than the\nMets this year.\n\nNow, I know \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of number crunching for one column.\n\nBut here\u2019s one last, most important, stat to consider. While Cubs\u2019 team on-base\npercentage was .343 (good for third in the league), and the Indians at .329\n(eighth), the Mets finished at 23rd, reaching base at just a .316 clip. So, case\nclosed: such an inability to reach base, and get the ducks on the pond to trot\nhome because they are instead in the dugout, is the cause for the Mets\u2019\noffensive struggles.\n\nWhen Sandy Alderson was hired as general manager, he immediately began preaching\nthe value of on-base percentage. Reaching base, and hitting the home run, would\nproduce runs. That formulaic approach is sensible, and it works; but when you\nhave one foot ahead of the other, as the Mets did in 2016, you\u2019ll trip and fall\nbefore the finish \u2013 just like the Mets did in 2016.\n\nWhile a home run ball for every 25 at bats is good fun, it\u2019s not necessarily\ngood baseball. Observing on-base percentage and doubles are two demonstrable\ntestimonies to a well-rounded offensive approach. Put into action by two teams\nholding a 2016 pennant, one of which will rise, the model of getting on base\nbefore slugging the long ball is one the Mets need to adopt for a future run at\nthe Cubs\u2019 current ground.\n\nBecause if the Mets want to return to the Fall Classic, and capture World Series\nglory, they\u2019ll have to get back to basics.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0NEXT: SHOULD JUSTIN TURNER RETURN TO FLUSHING?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-FOLLOW ESNY - ELITE SPORTS NY ON GOOGLE NEWS TO KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST NEW\nYORK SPORTS NEWS.\n\n",

The Flat Hat asked 112\nstudents at the College of William and Mary for their opinions of these\nrestaurants to answer one question: What is the best pancake house in\nWilliamsburg?\n\nThe Flat Hat identified 17 sit-down breakfast restaurants, including pancake\nhouses, brunch restaurants and diners, which all serve pancakes on its regular\nmenu. Of these 17 restaurants, 13 are local businesses, with only four belonging\nto a larger chain. Using a survey, students rated the breakfast restaurants they\nvisited on a five point scale, ranging from very poor to excellent.\n\nPsychology and kinesiology major Morgan Carr \u201924 gave insight into her rating\ncriteria.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe most important things for a pancake house to be good include a good vibe,\ngreat customer service and a solid menu.\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe most important one for\nme is for sure the food \u2013 they gotta have a good mix of sweet and savory\nbreakfasts to really be good.\u201d\n\nAmong survey respondents, Colonial Pancake House proved to be the most popular\nrestaurant, with 73 out of 112 respondents having visited the location. Colonial\nPancake House not only had the highest number of reviews, but also the most\nfavorable reviews, at an average rating of 4.3 on a scale of one through five.\u00a0\n\nColonial Pancake House has been serving breakfast in Williamsburg since 1997.\nRita Prassas and her husband George own and operate the restaurant.\n\n\u201cWe love our William and Mary students!!!!\u201d Prassas wrote in an email to the\nFlat Hat, responding to the results of the recent survey.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is the place that my parents and I love to go to \u2013 it\u2019s our go-to spot,\u201d\nRachel Sawyer \u201926 said. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought my roommate there, and at the end of my\nfreshman year we all went to celebrate moving out. The pancakes there,\nespecially to me, are the best that I\u2019ve had in the area. My dad always raves\nabout the blueberry pancakes there. He still says to this day that Colonial\nPancake has the best blueberry pancakes he\u2019s ever had in his life.\u201d\n\nPopular brunch chains First Watch and Another Broken Egg Cafe followed Colonial\nPancake House in popularity, with 57 and 44 ratings, respectively.\n\n\u201cFirst Watch has really good avocado toast and this really good morning\nsuperfoods bowl,\u201d Giorgianna Heiko \u201925 said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really high-quality food\n\u2014 like you can tell the fruit they use in the morning superfoods bowl is fresh\nand the bread is light and fluffy because they have almond butter on the side of\nit. The chia pudding is also very fresh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was surprised \u2013 Another Broken Egg is fantastic,\u201d current M.B.A. candidate\nChristian Chisolm \u201918 said. \u201cBefore I came back for grad school, I had one\nbeside my house in Savannah, Georgia, which I would go to all the time.\u201d\n\nStudent\u2019s favorable ratings of Colonial Pancake house were consistent with\nratings from the general public found on Yelp.\n\nYelp reviewers rated the Tipsy Beans Cafe the highest out of the 17 breakfast\nrestaurants included in the Flat Hat\u2019s student survey, at an average of 4.4\nstars. International House of Pancakes received far more positive reviews from\nstudents, who gave IHOP a score of 3.14, compared to Yelp reviewers\u2019 2.12\nstars.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe old Williamsburg IHOP is unfortunately no longer with us \u2014 bless, rest in\npeace,\u201d Mazie Doss \u201922 M.Ed. \u201924 said. \u201cIt always took about an hour and 10\nminutes to get our food. I also went there with my ex and the whole 2019 Rocky\nHorror Picture Show cast, and that was an experience. I still miss that butter\npecan syrup.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe average survey respondent had visited 4.76 pancake houses, with the three\ngraduate students surveyed having visited more than 12 locations on average.\nOnly one respondent claimed to have visited all 17 pancake restaurants.\n\nCarr \u201924 has been to 12 out of the 17 restaurants included in our survey.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll of the pancake houses are good \u2013 I haven't been to a bad one per se, but\nI've gone to ones that I wouldn't go to again,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI think it kind of\nsuits Williamsburg very well because there is like the older population and then\nthere's the college kids, and everyone loves breakfast \u2013 so it's great.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBake Shop, Culture Cafe and Aromas, who do not serve pancakes on their regular\nmenus, proved to be popular choices in a write-in option for best overall\nbreakfast.\n\n\u201cFor social meetups, I would probably go somewhere pretty close to campus, like\nCulture Cafe \u2013 love Culture Cafe,\u201d Heiko said. \u201cI would say social meetup number\none is Bake Shop for their avocado toast and amazing lattes.\u201d\n\nFreshmen and sophomores visited pancake houses less frequently than\nupperclassmen. The seniors visited pancake houses more often than other classes,\nwith 44% responding that they visited pancake houses at least once a month. Of\nunderclassmen respondents, 86% of the Class of 2027 and 79% of the Class of 2026\nsaid they visited pancake houses one time at most during a semester.\n\n\u201cMy favorite breakfast option throughout my two years of living on campus was\nMarketplace breakfast, because it was just a lot fresher.\u201d Carr said. \u201cYou could\nget breakfast sandwiches and everything, and their biscuits and gravy was always\nso good.\u201d\n\nCoffee shops were the favorite option of upperclassmen, with 26% of the seniors\nand 28.1% of the juniors visiting them regularly. Each cohort visited fast food\nrestaurants at about the same rate between 18.6% for the sophomores to 21.4% for\nthe seniors.\n\n81 out of 112 respondents chose pancakes over waffles.\u00a0\n\nCarr voted in favor of waffles.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI love waffles because when you put sauces or toppings on them, it actually\nsoaks in and you get more of that per bite,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThey're also heftier,\nso you can make waffle breakfast sandwiches or you can make chicken and waffles.\nI just feel like pancakes don't have enough structural integrity, which is my\nbiggest problem with them.\u201d\u00a0\n\nChisholm voted in favor of pancakes, noting their ease of preparation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think pancakes are more filling than waffles and are harder to mess up,\u201d\nChisholm said. \u201cPancakes are very easy and simple, and you can do a lot of\nthings with them. I have found that I\u2019m a great chef, but a lot of people\naren\u2019t, so waffles tend to get burnt \u2014 they\u2019re either overcooked or undercooked.\nPancakes aren\u2019t extremely difficult because they cook so fast; you can kind of\ngo \u2018flip, flip, done.\u2019 It\u2019s more consistent.\u201d\n\nChisholm has been to 16 out of 17 of the restaurants included in our survey.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe best thing is just the options,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cYou can go to literally\nany street within a five mile radius of campus and you have five options on each\nstreet. The Williamsburg food scene is surprisingly diverse and great and a lot\nof people, especially on this campus, don\u2019t get out far enough to explore the\ndifferent restaurants \u2013\u2013 I would recommend doing so.\u201d\n\nSawyer voted in favor of waffles, mentioning her family\u2019s recipe.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy mom has this recipe that\u2019s been passed down in the family for years,\u201d Sawyer\nsaid. \u201cShe has these little packets of yeast that she\u2019ll use to make up the\nbatter the night before. She\u2019ll put the active yeast into it, let it rise\novernight, and then she\u2019ll get up early in the morning to bake it. They\u2019re\ntypically made around holidays or birthdays so there are good memories\nassociated with them. Colonial may make good waffles, but nothing compares to my\nmom\u2019s waffles.\u201d\n\nRestaurants were selected for this survey based on several criteria. Primarily,\nthe restaurant must serve pancakes as a regular menu item. This survey was also\nlimited to restaurants who primarily are marketed as breakfast, brunch, or cafe\nlocations offering sit-down service. This survey was also limited to locations\nwithin the City of Williamsburg.\n\nThe data featured in this story was collected by the Flat Hat Data Section in a\nsurvey conducted online during the period of October 9, 2023 to October 15,\n2023. Participation in this survey was voluntary, and responses were anonymous\nunless respondents opted to self-identify. The survey was distributed via Flat\nHat social media, the William and Mary Student Happenings Newsletter and by word\nof mouth. Members of the Flat Hat were permitted to take the survey provided\nthat they were not involved in the writing or editing process of this article.\nThe original survey can be found here.\u00a0In total, 112 respondents completed the\nsurvey, representing 1.65% of William and Mary\u2019s total undergraduate student\nbody. Yelp reviews were sourced from Yelp.\n\nCORRECTION (12/6/23): This article was updated by Sarah Devendorf, the Standards\nand Practices Editor to make the still image of the pie chart an interactive\ngraphic. Additionally, in an earlier version of the article, \"good\" was used as\na label twice for the graph, \"How Did the Most Popular Pancake Houses Stack Up?\"\nThis was changed so that one \"good\" now says \"poor.\"",
        "summary": "The City of Williamsburg is home to 11 independent pancake houses and a handful of additional breakfast locales serving up fresh stacks. The Flat Hat identified 17 sit-down breakfast restaurants, including pancakehouses, brunch restaurants and diners, which all serve pancakes. Of these 17 restaurants, 13 are local businesses, with only four belonging to a larger chain.",

        "content": "BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh became the latest state after Uttar Pradesh to pass an\nordinance prohibiting forced religious conversion to check what it calls \u201clove\njihad\u201d.\u00a0Besides, two other BJP states \u2014 Haryana and Karnataka \u2014 are also mulling\nlaws designed to prevent \u201cforcible conversions\u201d through marriage. The\u00a0BJP\ngovernment in Himachal Pradesh also brought into force a law this month\nrequiring a person to give prior notice to authorities for converting to another\nreligion and outlawing conversions solely for marriage.\n\nOdisha was the first state that enacted an anti-conversion law \u2014 the Orissa\nFreedom of Religion Act 1967, passed in 1968.\u00a0Gujarat passed its own version of\nthe law in 2003, prohibiting conversions from one religion to another by the use\nof \u201cforce, allurement, or fraudulent means\u201d.\u00a0In 2006, Rajasthan passed a similar\nBill but the Governor did not give assent to it because of complaints from\nminority communities. In the same year, the Jayalalitha-led government in Tamil\nNadu repealed the anti-conversion legislation passed in 2002 due to protests by\nChristian minorities.\n\nHere is what the \u2018love jihad\u2019 legislations of different states say:\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nA month since the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance,\n2020, came into effect on November 28, records show that the UP Police has\nregistered 14 cases and made 51 arrests, of whom 49 are in jail.\n\nThe law provides for a jail term of up to 10 years for any violations. Under the\nlaw, which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be\ndeclared \u201cnull and void\u201d if the conversion of a woman is solely for that\npurpose.\u00a0In case, such conversion is of a minor, a woman from the Scheduled\nCaste or Scheduled Tribe, then those found guilty would have to face a jail term\nfrom three to 10 years, with a minimum fine of Rs 25,000.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if such conversion is found at the mass level, then those\nguilty would face jail term from three to 10 years, with a minimum fine of Rs\n50,000.\u00a0Under the new law, it would be the responsibility of the one going for\nthe religious conversion to prove that it is not taking place forcefully or with\nany fraudulent means. In case, any violation is found under this provision, then\none faces a jail term from 6 months to 3 years and fine of minimum Rs 10,000.\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nThe Madhya Pradesh Freedom to Religion Bill 2020 stipulates jail terms of one to\nfive years, with a fine of Rs 25,000, in such cases. The penalty in case of a\nperson using \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d or \u201cimpersonation\u201d for religious conversion\nwill be higher, including a jail term of 3-10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000.\n\nIn a significant departure from the UP ordinance though on registration of FIRs\nin such cases, the MP Bill says these can be dealt with only by police personnel\nnot less than the rank of a sub-inspector, and that solely parents and siblings\nof the affected individual can file a complaint directly. In case a guardian or\na custodian wants to register an offence, they must approach a Sessions Court\nauthorised to deal in these matters and get a court order.\n\nThe other big departure between the MP Bill and UP law is the provision for\nmaintenance to women and rights to the property to children in the marriage\nunder question in the legislation planned by the\u00a0Shivraj Singh\u00a0 Chouhan\u00a0\ngovernment. The matter of maintenance will be dealt with as per Section 125 of\nthe CrPC.\n\nWhile both UP law and MP Bill envisage a jail term of two to ten years in case a\nperson being converted is a minor, or belongs to the Scheduled Caste or\nScheduled Tribe, the MP legislation talks of a penalty of Rs 50,000 against Rs\n25,000 in UP.\n\nBoth the legislations talk of three to five years of prison terms for religious\norganisations or individuals seen as carrying out mass conversions, but again\nthe penalty in MP is higher (Rs 1 lakh) than UP (Rs 50,000).\n\nIn both states, organisations or priests carrying out conversions have to inform\nthe district administration about 60 days before the date of conversion, failing\nwhich the organisation can have its registration cancelled and the priest or\nfacilitator face a jail term.\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nEarlier this month, Himachal Pradesh brought into force a law requiring a person\nto give prior notice to authorities for converting to another religion and\noutlawing conversions solely for marriage. The Himachal Pradesh assembly\npassed\u00a0the Freedom of Religion Bill, 2019, last year.\n\nAs per the Act, anyone who wishes to convert to any other religion will give a\ndeclaration to the district authorities at least one month in advance,\nspecifying that one is doing so as per his/her \u201cown volition or free consent\u201d.\nIn fact, even the religious priest who performs the conversion ceremony has to\ninform the authorities at least one month in advance.\n\nThe Act says that the burden of proof as to whether a religious conversion was\nnot effected through force or fraud lies on the person so converted, or the\nperson who has facilitated the conversion.\n\nAll offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable. The violator can be\npunished with a prison term ranging from one to five years, along with a fine.\nIn case the victim is a minor, woman or member of a Scheduled Caste or Tribe,\nthe imprisonment may extend upto seven years. Failure to declare the conversion\nin advance can also result in an imprisonment of upto two years.",

        "content": "The Education and Skills Funding Agency has committed to keep publishing\ninvestigations into academy trusts, despite the policy being reviewed as several\nreports gather dust.\n\nThe government last published an academy trust investigation in November last\nyear.\n\nBut a freedom of information request to the Department for Education shows 11\ntrusts are \u201csubject to ongoing investigation activity by the ESFA\u201d.\n\nMajor investigations into three scandal-hit academy chains \u2013 Bright Tribe, Lilac\nSky and SchoolsCompany that were stripped of their schools between 2016 and 2019\n\u2013 still haven\u2019t been published.\u00a0\n\nIt has now emerged the government has withdrawn its academy trust publication\npolicy, pending a review.\n\nThe most recent copy of the publishing policy said the government made a\ncommitment to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to release \u201cinvestigation\nreports into academy trusts within two months of completing its work\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIt will aim to publish the documents \u201cas soon as possible\u201d following their\ncompletion, with officials \u201ctaking account of any representations made by the\ninstitution or individuals\u201d.\u00a0\n\nTrusts and identifiable individuals who are criticised in the report, but who\nhave moved on, are given \u201c10 working days\u2019 notice of the publication date\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\n\u2018IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM\u2019\n\nDame Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC, said she would read \u201cthe ESFA\u2019s updated\ninvestigation policy with great interest\u201d, given the promises previously made.\u00a0\n\nWhen asked at what stage each of the ongoing 11 investigations was at, the ESFA\nsaid in the FOI that the cases were listed as \u201clive until such point as they are\nclosed\u201d.\u00a0\n\nHillier\n\nThere was \u201cno formal classification of investigation stage\u201d. It also noted that\nit was \u201cvery difficult to predict when reports will be published when\ninvestigations are ongoing\u201d.\u00a0\n\nOfficials stressed no documents \u201care published until all investigation,\nenforcement, and regulatory actions have been completed\u201d.\u00a0\n\nEducation professor Anne West of the London School of Economics described the\nreports as a \u201ccrucially important accountability mechanism\u201d. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWithout such reports there is a real risk that there will be no lessons learned\nwith more taxpayers\u2019 money being lost.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSTAFF REHIRED AFTER SEVERANCE PAYMENTS\n\nSchools Week previously revealed Bright Tribe, Lilac Sky and SchoolsCompany all\nfaced a review over payments to companies linked to them or their founders. The\ncases fuelled wider controversy over academisation.\u00a0\n\nBright Tribe allegedly claimed hundreds of thousands of pounds for incomplete\nworks, while Schools Week revealed claims of safeguarding breaches and unsafe\npremises at SchoolsCompany sites. \u00a0\n\nProblems at Lilac Sky \u2013 which shut in 2017 \u2013 included staff being rehired the\nday after receiving large severance payments.\u00a0\n\nAccounts, published in the summer, for SchoolsCompany stated that the trust\u2019s\n\u201cintention\u201d was for it to be wound up \u201cas soon as this becomes feasible\u201d, but\n\u201cthis is pending while\u2026[it] attempts to recover public funds\u201d. \u00a0\n\nFormer trustees are being pursued through the high court in an attempt to\nrecover up to \u00a32.8 million of \u201clost public funds\u201d.\n\nPapers for Bright Tribe said it \u201cis in the process of finalising outstanding\nmatters in relation to the previous operation of the trust before closing the\ntrust down\u201d. \u00a0\n\nIn its notice online, the ESFA said it would update its investigation policy\nshortly.\u00a0\n\n\nPATCHY COUNCIL TRANSPARENCY\n\nHowever, councils are also patchy on transparency. For instance, Lambeth Council\nin south London has refused to publish its investigation into former superhead\nSir Craig Tunstall, first launched in 2017.\n\nCouncils now have to publish more financial information about their schools\nafter Lord Agnew, the former academies minister, moved to bring them more in\nline with requirements on academies.\n\nThe DfE said the review would not consider changing the publication policy.\nInstead it will make the policy \u201cmore transparent and up to date\u201d.

        "content": "This year\u2019s Prestige Vanguard Award 2020 recipient is Ng Yi Ming, a visionary\nfintech entrepreneur who enables blockchain technology to improve lives.\n\nFor the better part of an hour, Ng Yi Ming deftly unravels the mystery that is\nblockchain to me, a writer whose tech expertise barely extends beyond Excel.\nDecoding deep technology for the layman has become second nature to the\n29-year-old, who has been running Tribe Accelerator, the Singapore-based\nblockchain accelerator he co-founded and is managing partner of, for over two\nyears now. I am just one of those he enlightens every week, given the enigma\nthat is blockchain and the fact that his company is one of the few of its kind\nin the world.\n\nTribe Accelerator is Singapore\u2019s first government-supported blockchain\naccelerator and aims to enable start-ups to leverage blockchain solutions. It\ncounts more than 40 global corporates including AXA, BMW Group Asia, Citibank,\nIBM, Intel, Temasek and more as partners. In just over a year, it has raised\nmore than $40 million for its early-stage portfolio firms. The accelerator is\nthe main arm of the Tribe group, where Yi Ming is co-founder and CEO. He likens\nit to a \u201cprofessional matchmaker of the digital age\u201d as it provides a neutral\nplatform to connect corporations, governments, universities and technical talent\nin one ecosystem.\n\nTurtleneck jumper, Herm\u00e8s\n\n\nTECH FOR GOOD\n\nEssentially, blockchain functions as an immutable ledger that records all\nmodifications made to it, making transactions transparent, reducing risks and\npreventing fraud. But, as he explains, it is the applied uses of this technology\nin solving real-world problems that make it truly revolutionary. These include\nallowing consumers to trace their food right up to the source, track the history\nof their second-hand car purchases and ascertain the authenticity of luxury\ngoods. It enables a deeper sense of trust in products purchased \u2013 especially\nthose that come at a premium.\n\nOne start-up that has greatly benefited from this is Mighty Jaxx, which develops\ndesigner toy and art collectibles. These are often limited-edition pieces made\nin collaboration with renowned artists and international brands like DC Comics,\nWarner Brothers and New Balance. As it ships its products globally, the local\ncompany faced issues where collectors were sending them photos of products and\ntrying to authenticate them virtually.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear about problems like these, it just makes me think, \u2018It\u2019s 2020.\nThere should be more ways to solve problems with technology\u2019,\u201d says Yi Ming, who\nwas a top Singapore Polytechnic aeronautical engineering graduate and the\nsalutatorian of his year, before furthering his studies at Imperial College\nLondon, where he obtained a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering with Honours\n(First Class).\n\nThrough Tribe Accelerator, Mighty Jaxx connected with GovTech, one of the seven\nSingapore government agencies the accelerator works with, to develop\nblockchain-enabled NFC chips that are embedded in each collectible. Buyers can\nscan the tamper-proof chip with their mobile phones to authenticate the item and\nregister as the owner.\n\nShirt, pants and belt, all Dolce & Gabbana; boots, Ermenegildo Zegna\n\nYi Ming also saw a way to help Mighty Jaxx capture a new source of revenue. \u201cThe\ndesigner toy industry is a multi-million-dollar one, and toys can sometimes flip\nfor up to 30 times its original value on the secondary market,\u201d he says. \u201cIf\nMighty Jaxx can capture even just 1 or 2 per cent of each secondary market\ntransaction, it would amount to a lot.\u201d\n\nToday, in order to transfer a collectible\u2019s certificate of authenticity to the\nnext owner, a fee is charged and goes directly to the people who created it.\n\u201cThis incentivises everyone on the supply chain, including artists and\ndesigners, to produce toys with good quality because now it\u2019s more than just the\nfirst sale that matters.\u201d\n\nSince working with Tribe Accelerator in April 2019, Mighty Jaxx has raised more\nthan $7 million in funding and grown from over 20 employees to more than 70.\n\u201cThis happened even through the pandemic, which I think is amazing,\u201d says Yi\nMing. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is using technology to help our home-grown champions\nscale. It makes me proud to showcase what Singapore can offer to the world on a\nblockchain perspective.\u201d\n\n\nBUILDING A COMMUNITY\n\nBeyond enabling blockchain to solve real-world problems, Yi Ming is also working\nto build a wider ecosystem that helps propel Singapore as a collaborative\nnation. \u201cToday, the problem with blockchain is not the technology as it has\nalready arrived,\u201d he explains. \u201cInstead, it is about how people work together \u2013\nthat\u2019s much harder.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning, getting competing corporations like IBM and Intel on board was\nno easy feat. \u201cFrom a business-centric standpoint, every corporation is vying\nfor market share and to be the leader of the technology. But the nature of\nblockchain is that it requires an ecosystem to prosper. This means industry\ncompetitors coming together to build a more robust network,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to\nreshape that old perspective.\u201d\n\nThey did so by presenting Tribe Accelerator as a neutral platform to drive\nindustry-led innovation, where different stakeholders have equal say and can\ncollectively agree on how to regulate the blockchain. This is unique for a\nblockchain accelerator and, as far as Yi Ming is aware, is the only one in the\nworld.\n\nSuit, shirt, tie and belt, all Dior Men\n\nAs with most new ideas, pitching it was challenging at first. However, once they\nreceived the support of Enterprise Singapore, the platform had credibility and\nstarted to gain traction. They brought in reputable global corporations and more\ngovernment agencies like the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA),\nNational Research Foundation (NRF) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),\nwhich consequently attracted high-calibre start-ups to come on board. Its\nnetwork of partners spans over 32 cities across the globe, allowing start-ups to\ngain wider access.\n\nThanks to the quality of its ecosystem, Tribe Accelerator has a\ncorporate-to-start-up engagement rate of at least 85 per cent, which is higher\nthan most accelerators out there. \u201cWe\u2019re now seen as a trusted and neutral\ngateway,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows that while corporates can fight for their own\nbusiness goals, working together collectively and growing Singapore as a leading\nglobal hub will benefit everyone as even more businesses will come here,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nIn the context of the pandemic, Yi Ming is resolute that a more collaborative\nworld is the way forward. \u201cThe whole purpose of forming a collaborative\necosystem is so we can generate and ripple more tech for good initiatives, solve\nmore problems and improve lives.\u201d\n\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE\n\nAnother important component of this ecosystem that has become a larger priority\nfor Yi Ming is enhancing tech education and employability. Investing in the next\ngeneration is a cause he strongly advocates.\n\nCurrently, he holds a few mentorship roles including Entrepreneur in Residence\nat INSEAD, where he supports promising MBA students with their entrepreneurial\npursuits. In response to a need for tech talent, Yi Ming launched Tribe Academy\nlast year to offer courses in specialised tech such as blockchain, data science,\ncybersecurity and machine learning.\n\nPullover, shirt and jeans, all Gucci\n\nOne of the programmes it runs in collaboration with Ngee Ann Polytechnic and\ncoding assessment platform Indorse is GoSchool, which teaches Go, Google\u2019s\nin-demand programming language used by leading technology companies across the\nregion. The curriculum is designed based on the sector\u2019s benchmarks and reviewed\nby leading industry experts. It equips talent with the necessary skills to go\nstraight to work.\n\nIn fact, there are about 150 jobs available at the programme\u2019s hiring partners\nsuch as Shopee, Garena, Foodpanda and Zalora. Additionally, GoSchool is\nsupported by SkillsFuture Singapore, which opens it up to fresh graduates and\nworking professionals looking to upskill.\n\nYi Ming and his team are also focusing on bridging the educational divide and\nboosting those who may not have equal opportunities. GoSchool offers its\nstudents an Income Share Agreement, allowing them to join without paying course\nfees until they have completed the programme and secured a full-time job. They\nwill then pay up to 20 per cent of their gross monthly salary.\n\n\u201cThis is an approach meant to treat students as investments rather than cash\ncows \u2013 a fundamental shift that could finally lift the crippling debt load we\nroutinely push onto students,\u201d he explains. Beyond GoSchool, Tribe also provides\nscholarships to developers to learn blockchain for free, and has issued 70 of\nthese since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cDigital adoption will be at the centre of the new world order,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHaving our start-ups, corporations, governments and technical talent on board\nwith blockchain in one ecosystem is heartening, because it all plays a part in\ndriving Singapore forward as a collaborative nation, an innovator and the global\nfrontrunner of the future.\u201d\n\n(Main and featured image: Shirt, trousers and belt, all Herm\u00e8s)\n\nFashion Direction: Johnny Khoo | Art Direction: Audrey Chan | Photography: Joel\nLow | Fashion Styling: Jacquie Ang | Hair & Grooming: Wee Ming, using\nSchwarzkopf Professional & Shu Uemura | Photography Assistance: Alfie Pan |\nFashion Assistance: Jessica Khor\n\nThe information in this article is accurate as of the date of publication.",

        "content": "On the heels of explosive 3x revenue growth in 2021, Gen Z skincare brand\nTopicals closed $10 million in Series A funding led by Cavu Consumer Partners.\n\nWHO: Topicals was founded in 2020 by Olamide Olowe, who is on a mission to marry\nself-care with treating skin-related conditions. With one in four Americans\nexperiencing chronic skin conditions, Topicals has reimagined how consumers\ntreat flare-ups with effective products made with ingredients and herbals that\nhave been scientifically proven via third-party, peer-reviewed clinical studies.\n\nWHY: The funding will further propel Topicals' omnichannel growth, drive new\nhires, support channel expansion, and fuel brand marketing awareness. The\ncompany will also continue its mission of raising awareness around the\nconnection between mental health and skin conditions.\n\nIN THEIR OWN WORDS: \"I love Cavu's focus on mission-driven brands, and from the\nfirst conversation with their team, it was clear that they shared our vision of\ndisrupting the ointment category. They're very hands-on with their portfolio\nbrands, which was the biggest differentiator. At this stage of growth, it's\ncrucial for us to have an investment partner who can provide value outside of\ncapital, and with Cavu we have a team of experts ready to roll their sleeves up\nand do the hard work of taking this brand to the next level,\" said Olamide\nOlowe, founder and CEO of Topicals.\n\n\"Through Topicals, we believe Olamide has set a new standard in beauty\u2014not only\nby formulating and marketing effective over-the-counter replacement products for\nskincare\u2014but also by destigmatizing the way consumers speak about their skin\nconditions,\" said Jenna Jackson, Principal of Growth at Cavu Consumer Partners.\n\"Topicals is truly a category creator in that regard and truly aligns with\nCavu's philosophy of investing in and building brands creating better-for-you\nproducts. I'm thrilled to partner with Olamide and this boundary-pushing beauty\ncompany.\"\n\nTRIBE DYNAMICS EMV:\u00a0Offering lab-tested products for skin conditions, and with a\nlegacy of mental health advocacy, Topicals\u2019 timely themes and messages resonated\nwith consumers in Q4. The brand accrued $2.9MM EMV, a 68% QoQ gain that also\nrepresented a 124% YoY leap. While Topicals\u2019 potency ($3.5K EMV per creator)\ndeclined by 10% QoQ, its 962 creators marked an impressive 86% QoQ surge, which\nled to a corresponding 135% QoQ spike in the brand\u2019s content volume (2.1K\nposts). A majority of Topicals\u2019 growth was powered by creators who hadn\u2019t\nmentioned the brand in Q3. This incoming cohort accounted for $2.1MM EMV, along\nwith seven of Topicals\u2019 top 10 earners, including its No. 1 earner, musician\nMaiya The Don (@maiyathedonn on Instagram).\n\nDETAILS:\n\n * Topicals closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Cavu Consumer\n   Partners, bringing the total funding to date to $15 million.\u00a0\n * Brand sales tripled in 2021 and projects revenue to grow by more than 600\n   percent in 2022.\n * Topicals is reportedly the fastest-growing skincare brand at Sephora and has\n   sold one product every minute this year.\u00a0\n * To date, Topicals has donated more than $50,000 to support nonprofits\n   providing mental health resources for marginalized communities. To expand\n   this mission, Topicals is launching a 12-month accelerator program designed\n   to provide nonprofits in the mental health space with leadership training,\n   mentorship, and business advisory.\u00a0\n * Jenna Jackson, Principal of Growth at Cavu Consumer Partners, will also join\n   Topicals' Board of Directors.\n * In 2020, Topicals raised $2.6 million over three rounds of funding. Among\n   early supporters and investors in Topicals are several high-profile Black\n   women, including Netflix CMO Bozoma Saint John, entrepreneur and DJ Hannah\n   Bronfman, and the Emmy-nominated stars of the hit show Insecure Issa Rae and\n   Yvonne Orji. The initial investment round, led by Lerer Hippeau, also saw\n   participation from Humble Lukanga and Mucker Capital as well as the CEOs of\n   Warby Parker, Allbirds, Casper, Harry's, Bombas, and Red Antler.",

        "content": "Ryan Chew, a Forbes 30 under 30 2020 icon, is Tribe Accelerator\u2019s chief\noperating officer \u2014 a globally focused blockchain accelerator supported by the\nSingaporean government. He\u2019s also a Commissioned Officer of the Singapore Armed\nForces and holds the rank of captain in the Singapore Artillery.\u00a0\n\nToday, Chew is working hard to grow Tribe Academy, which offers courses in\nspecialised technologies such as blockchain, data science, cybersecurity and\nmachine learning to help fill a talent gap in the emerging tech industry,\nespecially in developing countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nHe has also founded several startups at a young age. From gaming to utility\napps, he\u2019s got plenty of hands-on experience in the startup industry. One of his\nventures, a gaming app called \u201cSo Charades,\u201d which he developed when he was only\n21.\n\nChew, a sociology major who graduated from Nanyang Technological University,\nwent on to serve as managing director and a member of the board of directors of\nVerlocal \u2014 a Silicon Valley startup. Within a year, he grew the company to a\nteam of 10 and helped more than 100 SMEs and freelancers turn their passion into\ntheir careers.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s on a mission to help build sustainable communities that will help companies\nwith new frontier technologies like blockchain. We talk to him about his studies\nabroad in the US and in Sweden, and where he envisions his digital programming\ncompany to be in the future:\n\n\nWALK US THROUGH \u201cSO CHARADES\u201d AND \u201cFIXIR.\u201d WHAT WAS YOUR PASSION BEHIND THESE\nAPPS?\n\n\u201cSo Charades\u201d was essentially a localised version of the US game \u201cHeads Up!\u201d by\nEllen DeGeneres, which started because I wanted to solve a problem. While \u201cHeads\nUp!\u201d was fun, it was very Americanised. For a Singaporean like me, I spent most\nof the game tapping the skip button. So I developed \u201cSo Charades\u201d, which\nincorporates local characters and personalities from my country.\n\nMobile gaming apps have taken the world by storm since 2008 when Apple released\n500 apps. Source: Jewel Samad/AFP\n\nAs for \u201cFixir,\u201d it\u2019s an app that allows drivers to easily get quotations for\ntheir car repairs from reliable car workshops within their vicinity. This aims\nto solve problems that young inexperienced drivers face when they encounter\nissues with their cars but do not know who they can get help from.\u00a0\n\n\nHOW DOES TRIBE ACCELERATOR HELP DEVELOP JOB-READY TECH TALENTS?\u00a0\n\nThis digital programming platform in Singapore is the world\u2019s first\ngovernment-supported blockchain accelerator. It brings together governments,\ncorporations and transnational institutions from around the world.\u00a0\n\nTribe is supported by government institutions from Singapore, the Middle East\nand Europe. It\u2019s also backed by some of the world\u2019s leading organisations such\nas Citibank, BMW, Alibaba, IBM, PwC, AXA, WeBank, Intel, among others. It\u2019s also\nsupported by institutions like the World Economic Forum, the International\nMonetary Fund, the United Nations Development Programme and more.\u00a0\n\nWith all this support, Tribe has helped raise more than 50 million US dollars in\nfunding for cutting-edge startups from around the world with a total valuation\nof over US$1 billion. These startups aim to solve global problems, from food\nsecurity to medicine deliveries.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to supporting blockchain startups, we are working to increase skills\nand talent development in this field. We have launched Tribe Academy, which is a\ndigital programming school based on an innovative income share agreement that\nspreads the cost of education across education bodies, governments, corporate\nenterprises and startups.\u00a0\n\nThis initiative is being rolled out across Southeast Asia and aims to help\nunderprivileged, talented students in developing regions access high-quality\neducation; it also gives them a better chance at quality employment. Tribe\nAcademy offers courses in specialised technologies such as blockchain, data\nscience, cybersecurity and machine learning.\u00a0\n\nTo date, Tribe Academy has also given out over 100 scholarships for individuals\nacross developing markets. This allows them to learn about blockchain and apply\nthat knowledge in an industry setting and has already placed graduates with\ncompanies like Shopee and Zalora.\u00a0\n\n\nWITH THE RISE OF BLOCKCHAIN, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS WITH TRIBE? WHAT COUNTRIES ARE\nYOU LOOKING TO FOCUS YOUR COMPANY GROWTH IN?\n\nWe have plans on expansion in Southeast Asia and further afield. We plan to\nexpand Tribe Academy offerings in Vietnam and Indonesia as we see a lot of\npotential in both of these markets and the need to develop talent there.\u00a0\n\nWe realised a knowledge gap in the ecosystem where firms struggled to find\nqualified candidates to join their teams, especially in blockchain which was\nstill quite new technology with relatively few students choosing to study it.\u00a0\n\nHence, Tribe Academy comes in. We are also due to launch our No Code App\nDevelopment course \u2014 an eight-week course that equips entrepreneurs and\nintrapreneurs with the skills needed to design and develop their own web app\nusing the platform: Bubble.\n\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to develop apps running from\nsimple designs to more complex ones, including social media sites, ride-hailing\napps or marketplaces. Entrepreneurs with zero coding knowledge or experience\nwill be able to bring their ideas to life. This allows them to build and test\nprototypes faster and at a fraction of the cost of the more traditional\nmethods.\u00a0\n\nChef Aaron Sanchez talks about blockchain technology to track foods. IBM is\nanother global company backing Chew\u2019s brand. Source: David McNew/AFP\n\n\nHOW DID YOUR INTEREST IN SOCIOLOGY START?\n\nI have always believed that education should be viewed holistically, not\nindependently. The way I see it, there are three phases to my education.\u00a0\n\nThe first is my primary and secondary education. This phase helped me develop\nthe building blocks that would prepare me for the world with key subject areas\nthat include maths, science, and history, among others.\n\nThe next phase would be my polytechnic days \u2014 it was here that I learned skills\nand tools which allowed me to contribute to society. I remember thinking during\nthis period that the IT/technology and business would eventually merge \u2014 which\nis what we see as digitalisation today.\n\nThe final phase in uni, I chose to study sociology because I wanted to\nunderstand the rules of the \u201cgame\u201d. Sociology helps provide a perspective that I\ncan derive insights into certain decision-making situations.\u00a0\n\n\nWHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO STUDY ABROAD IN SWEDEN AT LUND UNIVERSITY? WHAT SKILLS DID\nYOU GAIN FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE THERE?\n\nI wanted to experience a different culture and am forever thankful that I chose\nto study abroad. The experience of meeting, mingling and working with people\nfrom other countries and cultures has stayed with me and taught me lessons that\nI still use to this day.\u00a0\n\nSingapore itself is a very multicultural place. Every day we meet and work with\na wide range of people from different backgrounds, so I can say it has directly\nhelped me in my career. Lastly, I would say this period helped build\nresourcefulness. Being abroad and learning how to make it work forced me to not\nbe afraid of asking questions and getting stuff done.\n\n\nWHAT INSPIRED YOU TO STUDY AT THE MIT SLOAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT AFTER?\n\nI wanted to further my knowledge on blockchain. At the time, it was a very\nnascent technology that was not used widely, more theoretical if anything. MIT\nallowed me to surround myself with \u201ctechies\u201d who were at the forefront of\ntechnology in general \u2014 out-of-the-box thinkers. I definitely learnt a lot\nduring my time there.\n\nWith the blockchain course, I learnt to empathise with people who are looking to\nunderstand the field better too. For instance, what are the key teething issues\nwith blockchain that people have a hard time understanding and what is done to\nhelp them better understand it.\n\nMIT provided Chew with invaluable experience into the world of tech. Source:\nMaddie Meyer/AFP\n\n\nWHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR STUDENTS LOOKING TO STUDY ABROAD IN THE WORLD OF\nTECHNOLOGY?\n\nWhen it comes to studying abroad, I say go for it! The great thing about Tribe\nis that we work with many international clients and partners; international\ngraduates will be used to this type of diverse environment in the workforce.\u00a0\n\nI would also recommend working in the world of technology; it\u2019s important to\nunderstand that it\u2019s constantly changing and advances very quickly. So it\u2019s\nvital that those who study technology have an open mind and ensure they are\nconstantly curious and are ready to learn new skills every few years.",

The consortium is backed by\nmore than 100 Chinese organizations, including JD Finance, Huawei, ZTE, WeChat\nowner Tencent, and WeBank, which was founded by Tencent (currently has 30%\nstake).\n\nThis is a first step in taking FISCO BCOS outside of China\u2019s borders. FISCO BCOS\nwas also the first blockchain supported by the\u00a0Blockchain Service Network,\nChina\u2019s national infrastructure, which also has international ambitions.\n\nThe initial target group is to introduce students from some of Singapore\u2019s\nleading universities to FISCO BCOS. Referring to the collaboration, WeBank\u2019s\nHenry Ma, EVP and CIO said: \u201cCombining forces is the first stepping stone to\nexpanding the consortium into Southeast Asia, and ensures we are well fed by a\nconstant source of knowledge, technology expertise, and domain experience.\u201d\n\nOpenNodes is an ecosystem that helps to educate corporates and link them with\ntechnology providers. Numerous tech companies are stakeholders, including IBM,\nR3, ConsenSys and Ethereum, as well as corporates such as BMW, PWC and Singapore\nstock exchange SGX.

        "content": "Welcome to the third feature in the IWD Spotlight series, where women in the\nscience and tech industry share their journey and advice for others walking the\nsame path.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU\u2019VE PERSONALLY ENCOUNTERED OR SEEN WOMEN FACE\nIN THE TECH INDUSTRY?\u00a0\n\nIt has been quite positive for me ever since I took the first step into the tech\nindustry in Singapore. I have heard and seen many women in the tech industry who\nhave become successful leaders and entrepreneurs, paving the way for others to\nfollow in their footsteps. Women-led startups and tech companies are increasing\nin number and gaining more recognition.\n\n\n> DIVERSITY BRINGS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES TO THE TECH INDUSTRY,\n> WHICH CAN LEAD TO INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS. DIVERSE TEAMS ARE MORE\n> LIKELY TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE AND PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS.\n\nTake my example \u2013 I\u2019m one of many others who were welcomed at Tribe Accelerator,\ndespite coming from a vastly different professional background. Each person\nbrings their unique skills and perspectives to the table. By collaborating\nsmoothly and leveraging each other\u2019s strengths, we can generate value for both\nthe blockchain industry and our portfolio companies. Our team\u2019s strength lies in\nthe diversity we bring to the group, making it a powerful tool for success.\n\n\nWHAT CAN SOCIETY DO TO ENSURE GENDER EQUITY IN A MALE-DOMINATED INDUSTRY?\u00a0\n\nEnsuring that women have access to the skills and knowledge required for success\nin any field is essential. To achieve this, we can support initiatives that\nprovide education and training opportunities, particularly for underrepresented\ngroups. By promoting such efforts, we can create a more equitable society where\neveryone has the chance to fulfill their potential.\n\n\nWHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF WHEN STARTING OUT?\u00a0\n\nThe first thing would be to maintain a strong appetite for knowledge and nurture\nmy curiosity through more interactions with like-minded people from the\nindustry. Often, it can be challenging to find the right platforms to do so. The\nblockchain sector is ever-changing, so it\u2019s imperative to continuously learn new\nthings and enhance our skills.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d advise myself to strategically expand my network. Seeking out\nplatforms and events where you can connect with people who share your interests\nis important. Engage in conversations with individuals from diverse backgrounds\nto gain fresh perspectives and broaden your outlook. Ultimately, don\u2019t hesitate\nto pursue your passion and make a professional switch if that\u2019s what you truly\ndesire.\n\n\nWHAT KIND OF WORKPLACE/INDUSTRY CHANGES DO YOU HOPE TO SEE IN THE NEXT FIVE\nYEARS OR SO?\u00a0\n\nI hope to see more breakthrough innovations in the blockchain space that can\nsolve real-world problems.\n\nWith the new generation of the internet, Web3 evolving at a fast pace, with many\ncreative and promising startups on the rise that can push its growth to the next\nlevel. One of Tribe Accelerator\u2019s alumni, Mighty Jaxx, a Singapore-based\nintegrated future culture platform that designs and produces digital and\nphygital collectibles, is driving the future of collectibles.\n\nFor more innovation, talents are a must. There needs to be a greater emphasis on\ncontinuous learning and development in the industry. Startups are looking for\npromising talents in the blockchain space, and we help bridge them to these\ntalents as we continue to support upskilling and open innovation programs.\n\nI also hope to see a growing commitment to diversity and inclusivity in the tech\nindustry. Many people are advocating for increased representation of\nunderrepresented groups in tech roles and leadership positions, and for the\ncreation of inclusive work environments where everyone feels valued and\nsupported.",

As announced in The\nWaterways Times, another bill was presented in Parliament in April called the\nCritical Framework Government Advance Demonstration (SINGA). Whenever passed,\nthe bill will approve the state to raise up to SG$90 billion (US$67.3 billion)\non capital business sectors, which will be explicitly reserved for public\nfoundation with a valuable existence of at any rate 50 years. The fundamental\nneeds for spending are extensions of the public travel framework and seaside\ninsurance measures.\n\nThe last time the Singaporean government acquired back significant foundation\nspending was during the 1970s and \u201980s, when the nation required assets for the\ndevelopment of Changi Air terminal and its incipient MRT framework. By the\n1990s, thundering monetary development, venture inflows, and fares made an\nagreeable excess yet to be determined of installments and the state financial\nplan. Astoundingly, this implied the public authority decided not to give\nadditional bonds for public foundation \u2013 everything could be paid for out of\nincome, saves, and overflows.\n\nIndeed, that is incompletely obvious in any case. In established truth, legal\ngovernment bodies like the Land Transport Authority (LTA) issue securities on\ncapital business sectors with some recurrence, utilizing the returns to put\nresources into framework and long haul capital enhancements. The essential\ncontrast is that these are commonly not ensured by the state, and they don\u2019t\ntally toward the public obligation since the legal board, from a certain\nperspective, accepts the entirety of the danger.\n\nThis gives us a brief look into the entrancing intricacy of Singapore\u2019s\nhybridized state industrialist framework. What\u2019s tale about the SINGA enactment\nis that without precedent for many years the state will do the hard work on\ncapital business sectors itself to fund significant framework projects. Maybe\nthan raise assets through its self-sufficient legal sheets, the public authority\nis setting the full weight of its sovereign force behind these bonds.\n\nThis is fascinating since, supposing that you go on the Financial Authority of\nSingapore\u2019s site, you will track down the accompanying relaxed technocratic\nflex: \u201cThe Singapore Government works a decent spending strategy and frequently\nappreciates spending plan excesses. It doesn\u2019t have to subsidize its use by\ngiving securities to get cash.\u201d However assuming it doesn\u2019t have to, for what\nreason is it deciding to do so now? There are several reasons.\n\nThe state is gauging a requirement for huge scope interest in open foundation,\nespecially environment relief endeavors. On the off chance that the public\nauthority gives these securities, instead of the LTA, it will probably improve\nfinancing terms, and yields on long haul government obligation have been on the\ndecay in any case. The normal yield on a 15-year Singaporean government security\nin 2020 was 1.11 percent, contrasted with 2.9 percent in 2015, so in the event\nthat they will give government securities it would be monetarily judicious to do\nso now.\n\nThere is additionally a basic faith in Parliament that doing these once-a-age\nfirst-class consumptions spreads the weight and the advantage out equally over\nthe long run for Singaporean residents. In other words, administration is\nexceptionally aware of staying away from the presence of running up huge\nexpenses for projects with prompt advantages while burdening later ages with\nlarge obligation headaches. They need to be evenhanded in the manner the\nexpenses and the advantages are conveyed all through society over the long run,\nand spending large once at regular intervals on open ventures that will keep\ngoing for a very long time marks that container.\n\nYet, it additionally mirrors a sort of philosophical shift in progress in how\ngovernments and financial backers and individuals consider worldwide frameworks\nof capital, sovereign obligation, and the job of the state. For quite a while,\nthe financial universality coming from places like the IMF and U.S. Depository\nOffice advised against financial shortfalls and obligation. Current record\nexcesses and adjusted spending plans have for quite some time been viewed as the\nhighest quality level for mindful development, particularly in arising\neconomies. In any case, on the off chance that you take a gander at the US\ntoday, where a fight is seething about whether Washington ought to acquire\ntrillions of dollars to put resources into the public framework, you can see\nthat the details of this discussion are evolving. A few states are getting more\nopen to running shortages to finance interest in long haul development and\nsovereign obligation, at any rate in certain circles, is viewed as less of a\ngooney bird than it used to be. That Singapore, a country which has stayed away\nfrom government getting to subsidize framework for a large portion of my life\ntime, is presently hoping to do only that gives us some thought of how much the\nneedle has moved.",
        "summary": "Without precedent for a very long time, the state is looking to get funds to subsidies long-term infrastructure upgrades. The last time the Singaporean government acquired back significant foundation spending was during the 1970s and \u201980s. The state is gauging a requirement for huge scope interest in open foundation, especially environment relief endeavors.",

Adjusted EBITDA is\nalso not a measure recognized in accordance with IFRS and does not have a\nprescribed or standardized meaning by IFRS. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA\nas net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based\ncompensation, interest expense, income tax expense, impairment charges and other\nexpenses. It should be noted that Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under IFRS and\nmay not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities. The Company\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure as it provides important and\nrelevant information to management about the operating and financial performance\nof the Company. Adjusted EBITDA also enables management to assess its ability to\ngenerate operating cash flow to fund future working capital needs, and to\nsupport future growth. Excluding these items does not imply that they are\nnon-recurring or not useful to investors. Investors should be cautioned that\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to shareholders should not be construed as an\nalternative to net income (loss) or cash flows as determined under IFRS.\n\n2\u00a0Non-IFRS measure that does not have a standard meaning and may not be\ncomparable to a similar measure disclosed by other issuers. Gross Profit and\nGross Profit Percentage do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS, and\ntherefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nThe Company defines Gross Profit as revenue less cost of software and services\nand software licensing fees, and Gross Profit Percentage as Pross Profit\ncalculated as a percentage of revenue. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Percentage\nshould not be construed as an alternative for revenue or net loss in accordance\nwith IFRS. The Company believes that gross profit and gross profit percentage\nare meaningful metrics in assessing the Company's financial performance and\noperational efficiency.\n\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that\nterm is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts\nresponsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\n\nThis news release may contain certain \"Forward-Looking Statements\" within the\nmeaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nand applicable Canadian securities laws regarding the Company and its business.\nWhen or if used in this news release, the words \"anticipate\", \"believe\",\n\"estimate\", \"expect\", \"target, \"plan\", \"forecast\", \"may\", \"schedule\" and similar\nwords or expressions identify forward-looking statements or information.\nForward-looking statements or information in this news release may relate to\nstatements with respect to the aims and goals of the Company; financial\nprojections; growth plans including future prospective consolidation in the\nproperty management sector; future acquisitions by the Company; closing and\nintegration of the acquisition of\u00a0Meritus Group Management Inc.; beliefs of the\nCompany with respect to the independent owner-investors market; prospective\nbenefits of the Company's platform; and other factors or information.

        "content": "Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal member Rachael Lovely was at home \u2014 and in labor with\nher second child in 2022. She decided to build a prayer fire, which would remain\nlit throughout her entire labor. Lovely felt certain the ancestors would hear\nher prayers and help her through childbirth.\n\n\"I went out and prayed at the fire and offered tobacco,\" said Lovely. \"That was\nmy way of incorporating ceremony and tradition into the birth of my child.\"\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe has welcomed about 100 babies\ninto its Nation, according to Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal member Alexandra\nLopes-Pocknett.\n\n\"It's probably the biggest baby boom we've had in a century,\" said\nLopes-Pocknett.\n\nWith so many babies being born into the fold, and limited traditional tribal\nknowledge surrounding childbirth and lactation ceremony, Lovely and\nLopes-Pocknett, along with Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal member Keturah Peters, are\noffering an Indigenous Lactation Counselor Training, which will run from Sept.\n23-27. Classes will be held at the Wampanoag Language Reclamation Project in\nMashpee.\n\nLactation training can help break the overuse of baby feeding formula, and help\nstrengthen the tribal community, Lovely said.\n\n\nLOVELY: INVALUABLE TO GROWING FAMILIES\n\nThe knowledge the training will bring to Wampanoag people, and tribal people\nfrom other communities, is invaluable to growing families, said Lovely.\n\n\"When a family is able to support and nourish their babies by breastfeeding,\nthey are able to independently provide those babies with the most adequate\nnutrition, the strongest medicine, and the safest sustenance,\" said Lovely.\n\nThe training is being offered to Indigenous people from the Mashpee Wampanoag\nTribe, but also men and women from other tribal communities. Applications must\nbe submitted by Aug. 8, according to the event's flyer. Lovely and\nLopes-Pocknett are also fundraising to ensure that all meals can be provided to\nparticipants.\n\nThe training, funded by a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, will be led by the founding executive director of Hummingbird\nIndigenous Family Services, Camie Goldhammer, and Kimberly Moore-Salas, a\nlactation consultant at Maricopa Integrated Health System.\n\n\"The training will offer attendees an opportunity to bond with other Native\nwomen and their entire families,\" said Lopes-Pocknett. \"These are just the\nbeginning steps we are taking to ensure health and longevity when it comes to\nreproductive rights for Indigenous people in our homelands.\"\n\n\nWHAT WILL PEOPLE LEARN DURING THE TRAINING?\n\nGoldhammer, who is Sisseton Wahpeton, and Moore-Salas, who is Din\u00e9, created the\nfirst and only lactation counselor training created by Native people for Native\ncommunities. The duo have trained roughly 550 Indigenous lactation counselors\nacross the continent, according to the Hummingbird Indigenous Family Services\nwebsite.\n\nMashpee is one of three Indigenous communities that will receive the training\nduring the CDC grant cycle. There are about 20 slots available, said Lovely.\n\nThe training will cover how to breastfeed, alternative feeding methods, father\nand family support, historical trauma and parenting practices, and how food\nsovereignty is connected to breastfeeding and lactation.\n\n\"We will be unpacking our own personal histories and community histories to see\nhow that relates to our views on feeding our children,\" Lovely said. \"There is\npotential trauma that comes through us genetically \u2014 just by being born\nIndigenous.\"\n\nOn the fifth day of the class, Lovely said attendees will be certified in\nlactation and breastfeeding practices. The hope, she said, is that these women\nwill then use the skills and knowledge they've gained in their tribal\ncommunities.\n\n\"It will then be our collective responsibility to help community members and\nshare these teachings,\" she said.\n\n\nWHAT IS FOOD SOVEREIGNTY?\n\nFood sovereignty is a particularly important aspect of the training, Lovely\nsaid. For generations, baby feeding formula has been normalized and pushed on\nnew mothers by doctors and family members, she said.\n\n\"If you can feed a baby with just your body and you are not depending on\nformula, and you have your community standing behind you, that's being\nsovereign,\" said Lovely.\n\nFormula has also faced shortages in recent years, said Lopes-Pocknett, and has\nalso become extremely expensive. In 2022, hundreds of tribal women in the local\ncommunity relied on donated breast milk because baby formula couldn't be found.\n\n\"The knowledge people will learn in the training brings us back to a more\nhistoric way of nourishing our children,\" said Lopes-Pocknett.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY SUPPORT WAS OVERWHELMING\n\nWhen the training was announced by Goldhammer and Moore-Salas, hundreds of\ntribal communities applied to have the training taught in their territory, said\nLovely. Competition was fierce, she said.\n\nIn addition to the application, Lopes-Pocknett, Lovely, and Peters also\nsubmitted a letter that served as collective testimony about why local tribal\ncommunities wanted the training to be held in Mashpee. The group collected about\n76 signatures.\n\n\"The community recognized the value that breastfeeding and chest-feeding holds \u2014\nand the bonds it creates in a family,\" said Lovely. \"Also the food sovereignty\nit ensures, the health outcomes it guarantees, and the sacredness that it\ncarries.\"\n\nMashpee Wampanoag Clan Mothers also signed a letter of support. In the letter,\nClan Mothers, including Anita \"Mother Bear\" Peters of the Bear Clan; and Marlene\nLopez of the Rabbit Clan, said the trainings were vital to the Mashpee tribal\ncommunity and beyond.\n\n\"A strong, knowledgeable, supportive community surrounding a lactating parent is\noften the most crucial component to a parent being successful in offering that\nmilk medicine to a baby,\" read the letter.\n\nClan Mothers also said that the training will guarantee that local Native\ncommunities will have knowledgeable and competent individuals ready to support\nnew parents.\n\n\"This training fits right into this growing interest, especially at a time where\nwe, as a people, are growing so rapidly,\" read the letter.\n\n\nBREASTFEEDING BUILDS COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS\n\nFor Lovely, the community support has been one of the most important aspects of\nholding the training in Mashpee Wampanoag territory.\n\n\"This is a huge opportunity to focus on and increase the resources we have in\nour community,\" said Lovely. \"It's about the passion we have to help our people.\nIt will do nothing but strengthen our tribe in a very healthy way.\" \u00a0\n\nRachael Devaney writes about community and culture.

This is almost double from its last valuation of around $165-170\nmillion, ascribed after its February 2023 fundraise of $25 million in a mix of\ndebt and equity led by Taiwan\u2019s battery-swapping giant Gogoro.\n\n\n\nELEVATE YOUR TECH PROWESS WITH HIGH-VALUE SKILL COURSES\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science &\nMachine LearningVisitIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate in\nProduct ManagementVisitIndian School of BusinessISB Product ManagementVisit\n\n\u201cThe company is looking to raise funds for its Series C round\u2026this money is\nprimarily expected towards expanding the business into newer cities and building\nnew technology.

The unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 and related MD&A\nhave been reviewed and approved by Tribe's Audit Committee and Board of\nDirectors. Tribe recognizes that most of its investors are now accessing\ncorporate and financial information either through pushed news services,\ndirectly from or SEDAR. Thus, Tribe has prepared this truncated news release to\nalert investors to its results and that a more detailed explanation and analysis\nis readily available in the MD&A. These reports have been filed on SEDAR at and\nposted at .\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) Source:\n\n(2) Non-IFRS measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be\ncomparable to a similar measure disclosed by other issuers. Adjusted EBITDA is\nalso not a measure recognized in accordance with IFRS and does not have a\nprescribed or standardized meaning by IFRS. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA\nas net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based\ncompensation, interest expense, income tax expense, impairment charges and other\nexpenses. It should be noted that Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under IFRS and\nmay not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities. The Company\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure as it provides important and\nrelevant information to management about the operating and financial performance\nof the Company. Adjusted EBITDA also enables management to assess its ability to\ngenerate operating cash flow to fund future working capital needs, and to\nsupport future growth. Excluding these items does not imply that they are\nnon-recurring or not useful to investors. Investors should be cautioned that\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to shareholders should not be construed as an\nalternative to net income (loss) or cash flows as determined under IFRS.\n\n(3) Non-IFRS measure that does not have a standard meaning and may not be\ncomparable to a similar measure disclosed by other issuers. Gross Profit and\nGross Profit Percentage do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS, and\ntherefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\n\u00a0The Company defines gross profit as revenue, excluding ancillary revenues, less\ncost of software and services and software licensing fees. Cost of software and\nservices include direct costs of community managers, client accounting staff and\naccounting software, excluding client administration and other administrative\napplications. The Company defines gross profit percentage as gross profit\ncalculated as a percentage of revenues, excluding ancillary revenues. Gross\nprofit and gross profit percentage should not be construed as an alternative for\nrevenue or net loss in accordance with IFRS. The Company believes that gross\nprofit and gross profit percentage are meaningful metrics in assessing our\nfinancial performance and operational efficiency.\n\n\"Joseph Nakhla\"\nChief Executive Officer\n1606-1166 Alberni Street\nVancouver, British Columbia V6E 3Z3\nPhone: (604) 343-2601\nEmail:\n\nAbout Tribe Property Technologies\n\nTribe is a property technology company that is disrupting the traditional\nproperty management industry.

The Mashco Piro tribe, long secluded in the depths of the\nPeruvian forest, emerged from their isolated habitat for the first time, as\nrevealed by images released on Tuesday by the human rights organization Survival\nInternational.\n\n\n\nWHO ARE THE MASHCO PIRO TRIBE?\n\nThe tribe, known for shooting arrows at anyone who approaches too closely, was\nrecently spotted emerging from the rainforest near the Las Piedras River in\nMadre de Dios.\n\nIt has been noted that the Mashco Piro has had very few interactions outside its\ncommunity, and most of these interactions have been violent. Around 50 members\nof the Mashco Piro tribe have been reported to have visited the village of Monte\nSalvado.\n\nThe Mashco Piro speak a language closely related to the Yine people, which\nsometimes allows for communication when the Mashco Piro emerge seeking food and\nsupplies.\n\nYine people often hear the Mashco Piro before spotting them, as the tribe\nwhistles a high trill mimicking the tinamou bird. This whistle serves as a\nwarning for others to stay away while they collect turtles\u2019 eggs from the\nriverbank or gather fruit and vegetables.\n\n\n\nWHY DID THE TRIBE VENTURE OUT?\n\nAccording to the Survival International group, sightings of the Mashco Piro were\ndocumented in June. Reports from FENAMAD, a local Indigenous rights group,\nindicated that the tribe has been increasingly active outside their traditional\nterritory. It points out that increased logging activity in the area is likely\npushing the tribe out of their traditional lands. The Mashco Piro may be\nventuring closer to settlements in search of food and a safer refuge.\n\n\nMORE FROM THIS SECTION\n\n\n\nThe tribe\u2019s emergence is believed to be driven by the need for food and a safer\nplace to stay near the remote villages of Monte Salvado. Caroline Pearce,\ndirector of Survival International, stated, \u201cThese incredible images show that a\nlarge number of isolated Mashco Piro live alone a few kilometres from where the\nloggers are about to start their operations.\u201d\n\nThe Mashco Piro, who live in an area between two natural reserves in Madre de\nDios, have rarely been seen and do not typically communicate with the Yine or\nanyone else, according to Survival International.\n\nSeveral logging companies have permission to cut down trees on the land where\nthe Mashco Piro tribe lives. One of these companies, Canales Tahuamanu, has\nbuilt more than 200 kilometers of roads to allow logging trucks to haul away the\ntimber, according to Survival International.\n\nA representative from Canales Tahuamanu in Lima did not respond to media\nrequests for comment. The company is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council\nand has 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres) of forests in Madre de Dios for\nextracting cedar and mahogany.\n\nOn June 28, the Peruvian government reported sightings of the Mashco Piro along\nthe Las Piedras River, approximately 150 km from Puerto Maldonado, the capital\nof Madre de Dios. Rosa Padilha, from the Brazilian Catholic bishops\u2019 Indigenous\nMissionary Council in the state of Acre, noted that the Mashco Piro have also\nbeen sighted across the border in Brazil.\n\n\n\nINCREASED ENCROACHMENT ON TERRITORY\n\nThis is not the first instance of the Mashco Piro territory being invaded.\nDuring Peru\u2019s rubber boom in the 1880s, the Mashco Piro, along with many other\ntribes, were forcibly displaced, enslaved, and killed in large numbers. The\nsurvivors retreated further upstream on the Manu River, where they have lived in\nisolation ever since.\n\nNow, as logging companies continue to encroach on their land, experts say the\nMashco Piro have nowhere left to go. This has led to an increase in sightings in\nrecent years, as they venture out of their forested refuges not only in search\nof food and supplies but also to escape the encroaching outsiders.\n\nThe Mashco Piro has also been spotted across the border in Brazil. Rosa Padilha,\nfrom the Brazilian Catholic bishops\u2019 Indigenous Missionary Council, explained to\nReuters, \u201cThey flee from loggers on the Peruvian side. They are a people with no\npeace, restless because they are always on the run.\u201d\n\n\n\nWHY DOES THE TRIBE LIVE IN ISOLATION?\n\nDuring the infamous \u2018Rubber boom\u2019 of the 1880s, rubber barons invaded the\nterritory of the Mashco Piro and other Indigenous tribes in the western Amazon.\nThey enslaved thousands of indigenous people, subjecting them to murder,\nflogging, chaining, hunting, rape, and theft of their land and homes, according\nto the information available on Survival Internatioinal website. Some Mashco\nPiro managed to escape, retreating deep into the forest to the remote headwaters\nof rivers, where they remained hidden and uncontacted.\u00a0\n\nToday, their descendants still live in isolation, but their lands are once again\nunder threat. Significant part of their territory has been sold off for logging,\nand the sound of chainsaws now echoes through the forest.\n\nIn 2002, in response to lobbying by FENAMAD, the government established the\nMadre de Dios Territorial Reserve to protect Mashco Piro\u2019s forest. This\nbiodiverse territory spans several river basins near the Brazil border,\naccording to the human rights group.\n\nHowever, the Reserve covers only a third of the area proposed by FENAMAD,\nleaving large sections of Mashco Piro land unprotected. To complicate matters\nfurther, the government sold off much of this unprotected area as logging\nconcessions, allowing companies to harvest mahogany and other valuable hardwoods\nfor decades.\n\n\nALSO READ\n\n",

        "content": "In a situation that humanitarians call a \u201cdisaster in the making,\u201d loggers are\nencroaching on an uncontacted tribe in the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nSurvival International, a nonprofit that advocates for indigenous people\nworldwide, recently showed a video of several dozen Mashco Piro people on a\nriverbank. They are just several kilometers away from a prospective logging\nsite. According to the nonprofit, the footage depicts a dangerous incursion. If\nthe loggers and the natives cross paths, violence or disease could break out.\n\nDozens of Mashco Piro people are at risk in the loggers\u2019 plan.\n\nThe last time the two groups clashed in 2022, tribespeople attacked workers with\ntwo-meter-long arrows, killing a 21-year-old and injuring his 54-year-old\ncompanion.\n\nIn the Survival International statement, Alfredo Vargas Pio, President of the\nlocal indigenous organization Fenamad, blamed the Peruvian government for\nputting the tribe in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThis is irrefutable evidence that many Mashco Piro live in this area, which the\ngovernment has not only failed to protect but actually sold off to logging\ncompanies. The logging workers could bring in new diseases which would wipe out\nthe Mashco Piro, and there\u2019s also a risk of violence on either side, so it\u2019s\nvery important that the territorial rights of the Mashco Piro are recognized and\nprotected in law,\u201d Pio said.\n\n\n\n\nDISPUTED TERRITORY\n\nSince uncontacted tribes avoid interaction with outsiders by definition,\nunderstanding where they do and don\u2019t live can be difficult. Legally, the Mashco\nPiro\u2019s land exists as a reserve right next to a 50,000-hectare logging\nconcession owned by Canales Tahuamanu, or Catahua.\n\nThe Peruvian government granted the rights to both tracts in 2002. But it almost\nimmediately became clear that the isolated group ranged well beyond the\nreserve\u2019s borders.\n\nIn 2016, a panel from the ministry that handles Peru\u2019s indigenous affairs found\nthat the Mashco Piro were using land on 14 separate concessions. The panel\nrecommended expanding the reserve and paying the difference to the affected\nbusinesses. However, the measure died on its way through the government.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation in the Amazon began to worsen. Amid the employee\nslayings in 2022, Catahua sued locals advocating for the Mashco Piro in one\nvillage. A year later, a U.N. envoy asked the company to halt logging in the\narea, also alleging possible \u201cforced contact\u201d with the Mashco Piro.\n\nIn a Washington Post interview, the lawyer representing Catahua denied its\nworkers had ever contacted the tribe.\n\n\nHISTORY (AND FUTURE?) OF VIOLENCE\n\nThis is the next chapter in a narrative of harassment that has plagued the\nMashco Piro\u2019s relationship with outsiders for over a century.\n\nRubber tycoon Carlos Fermin Fitzcarrald commanded a private army to slaughter\nmost of the tribe in 1894. The episode forced the survivors deeper into the\nAmazon and opened a cultural wound that would not heal.\n\nSurvival\u2019s recent images show over 50 Mashco Piro people near Monte Salvado, a\nvillage inhabited by their close cousins, the Yine, in southeast Peru. Seventeen\nmore later appeared near a neighboring village.\n\nMashco Piro people in the Monte Salvado and Puerto Nuevo area.\n\nIt\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw away from Catahua\u2019s next logging target, according to\nSurvival. And the less-confrontational Yine previously told the nonprofit that\nthe Mashco Piro \u201cangrily denounced\u201d loggers\u2019 incursion on their land.\n\nFor companies like Catahua, regulations enforce sustainable practices \u2014 in\ntheory. In one 2014 study, a team of international lawyers found evidence that\nregulatory documents actually open the door for rampant illegal logging. Among\nthe 609 concessions active at the time, the group suspected \u201cmajor violations\u201d\non 68% of them, even under the supervision of authorities.\n\nInternational support for indigenous people\u2019s land rights is widespread. The\nU.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, International Labour\nOrganization, and the Inter-American Human Rights Commission all recognize the\nrights of indigenous people on their traditional lands. And U.N. guidelines on\nuncontacted peoples restrict outsiders from forcing contact upon them.\n\nAs Catahua poises to open operations at the new site, the threat of more\nviolence looms.\n\n\u201cThe Mashco Piro are desperate. Those arrows are the proof,\u201d Julio Cusurichi, an\nIndigenous leader Amazon icon, told the Post. \u201cThey would not have acted that\nway unless they were forced to.\u201d",

        "content": "Following a $7.5 million raise led by Hashed and Tribe Capital, Blueprint\nFinance, emerging from stealth, today announces Concrete Protocol, an on-chain\ncredit market that protects borrowers from liquidation, while offering yield to\nliquidity providers to fund short-term capital demands.\n\n\u201cThe goal of 2024 is to make it irresponsible for any [crypto borrower] to do it\nany other way than through our protocol,\u201d cofounder and CEO Nic Roberts-Huntley\ntold Fortune.\n\nBlueprint Finance is betting that DeFi is approaching a major inflection\npoint\u2014and lending activity will massively increase\u2014and is seeking to work with\nretail users, companies, and liquidity providers alike.\n\n\u201cWe can help anybody in crypto,\u201d said Roberts-Huntley. \u201cIf you\u2019re a casual user,\nand you want to start using debt in crypto, you would be crazy not to use us.\u201d\n\nBlueprint Finance was founded in 2022, when the collapse of FTX shattered much\nof the industry. Watching everything unfold, Robert-Huntley recalled, the team\nobserved the need for more robust and capital-efficient DeFi markets.\n\n\u201cThe implosion of centralized lenders created an opportunity for massive volume\ngrowth for on-chain money markets,\u201d the company said in a statement. However,\nthe team noticed a \u201cvoid\u201d in solutions and liquidity for DeFi users to protect\npositions when leveraged against volatile assets, often resulting in asset\nliquidation.\n\nConcrete is a protocol layered on top of crypto\u2019s existing $20 billion lending\nmarket. Its aim is to protect leveraged positions against collateral\ndepreciation and thus minimize the need for capital on hand. Simultaneously, it\noffers yield opportunities for liquidity providers to fund positions.\u00a0\n\nBut unlike other lenders in the space, Concrete will also absorb some of the gas\nfees and offer liquidation protection. \u201cWhen you take out that loan through us,\nbecause it\u2019s brokered through smart contracts, you\u2019re afforded the option to buy\nliquidation protection. That is effectively a fully automated agreement between\nyou, the borrower, and Concrete, the protocol,\u201d Roberts-Huntley explained.\n\nThe liquidation protection is created by using a series of quantitative\nmethodologies. In essence, Concrete calculates the probability of collateral\ndepreciation over time and creates an automated protection agreement to fund a\nposition as it approaches a liquidation threshold.\n\n\u201cBlueprint is building decentralized software that could help safeguard future\ntraders from major market events\u2014this is critically important to the safety and\ngrowth of crypto worldwide,\u201d Boris Revsin, a managing director at Tribe Capital,\nsaid in a statement.\n\nParticipating investors include SALT, Hypersphere, Lightshift, Portal Ventures,\nand Awesome People Ventures.\n\nRecommended Newsletter:\u00a0CEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need\nto know from across the world of business.

Hannah Lee Noll\n\nWe\u2019re only three races into the regatta, with plenty more to come at the\ninaugural RS Fest in Miami, but Michiel Geerling is already tallying points in\nhis head to determine where we sit in the results. He\u2019s got us tied for first in\nthe five-boat RS21 fleet, and third is only one point back. \u201cNot that the\nresults matter,\u201d Geerling says with a sheepish grin. \u201cBecause we\u2019re here to have\nfun, right?\u201d\n\nRight, but it\u2019s obvious that Geerling, whom I met only hours earlier, has real\nintentions of winning the regatta he\u2019s hosting\u2014even if that means beating\ncustomers. Racing is racing, and all is fair on Miami\u2019s sparkling Biscayne Bay\non this early spring weekend where sailors young and old and from far and wide\nhave gathered to race under the sun and the hot-\u00admagenta banners of RS Sailing.\n\nAs the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of sailing dinghies, with headquarters in\nsouthern England, RS has long enjoyed a global cult following, but while they\u2019ve\nbeen selling boats into the States for a long time, they\u2019ve never enjoyed the\nfull and warm embrace of the American racing scene. Thus, the inaugural RS Fest\nMiami\u2014their first go at an annual family reunion of sorts. This gathering is\nrelatively small, at 49 boats, but it\u2019s a start.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of something more\u2014the start of a tradition,\u201d Geerling\nsays. \u201cRS Sailing was born out of a desire to use the latest technology to build\nracing classes, to simplify life for the sailors to be racing and create these\nsailing communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarc Jacobi (No. 3), of \u00adWestport, Connecticut, aims for the leeward mark at the\nRS\u00a0Fest Miami. Hannah Lee Noll\n\nEmploying a playbook of focus-on-the-fun racing and hip social events, they\u2019ve\ngrown a plethora of one-design classes in Europe, and Geerling\u2019s intent is to do\nthe same in the US: \u201cThis is what I want to build [with the Fest], and I believe\nwe\u2019re onto something here.\u201d\n\nGeerling joined RS after breaking out of his self-\u00addescribed \u201cgolden cage\u201d in\nthe international coffee trade, he tells me. The money was good, but the sailing\nlifestyle was not. Before adulthood landed him in his cage, he once bandied\nabout Europe as a strapping lad from Amsterdam with a collection of RS dinghies\nattached to his van. Those were happy years of high-performance sailing and\nliving, he tells me, and that\u2019s why he now sits in the commercial director\u2019s\nchair at RS. He\u2019s far more content selling what he loves, and what he loves most\nis the dinghy sailing life. That\u2019s also true of most other RS C-suite\noccupiers\u2014all middle-aged \u00addinghy-sailing fanatics.\n\nThe four-day festival, which is staged out of Miami\u2019s Regatta Park and hosted by\nthe Coconut Grove Sailing Club, has four of RS\u2019s most popular racing classes:\nthe tyke-friendly roto-molded singlehander known as the Tera; the doublehanded\nand RS Feva, which I\u2019m told is the world\u2019s largest doublehanded racing class;\nthe all-glass-and-carbon RS Aero singlehander; and the RS21, their flagship\nkeelboat. It\u2019s lightweight, sporty and simple, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m sailing on\nfor the RS Fest, managing the front of the boat while Geerling drives. We have a\nrotating cast of first-time crews, including Katherine Fry. She\u2019s a J/70 sailor\nand a \u00adhigh-powered lawyer from London. Her husband, Alistair, a big-time\ndoctor, is racing in the Aero division. And more importantly, their two young\ndaughters, Trinny and Alexa, are teamed up in a Feva.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to plan an Easter holiday and learned about this regatta,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cAnd we thought, Why not? It\u2019s Miami\u2014somewhere we\u2019ve never been to and\nthat\u2019s easy to get to from London\u2014and everyone gets to sail. It\u2019s lovely,\nreally.\u201d\n\nOnce, as we loiter near the starting line shared by all the fleets, she points\nout her husband, who\u2019s checking in with the girls. She hastily extracts an\niPhone from her PFD, snaps a picture and beams with happiness, adoring this\nfamily postcard moment. Later, when we just so happen to be near the Feva\u2019s\nleeward gate mark, she spots her daughters again. They have a commanding lead\nand a tidy drop of the little asymmetric spinnaker, which quickly \u00addisappears in\nits deck sock.\n\n\u201cGreat job, girls!\u201d she shouts aloud with glee and a golf clap.\n\nThey\u2019re too preoccupied with the douse to acknowledge her praise, or thinking,\nGeez, Mum, please. You\u2019re embarrassing us. Still, the moment is poignant:\nmother, father, daughters\u2014all out playing on the same racecourses on a warm\nspring day in Miami.\n\nThis is also the case for Peter Cozzolino, of Milford, Connecticut. He\u2019s driven\nthe family\u2019s GMC Sierra 2500 from Connecticut with plans to race, and then take\ntwo brand-new Fevas back north and start a local movement at Milford YC. He\u2019s\npaired up with nephew Evan Davies, while his son Peter is sailing with\nCozzolino\u2019s other nephew, Peter Davies. Though he originally planned on leaving\nMiami with two boats, he ends up filling the empty rack in his triple-stack\ntrailer with a charter boat to seed in Milford.\n\n\n\nPeter Cozzolino and Evan Davies rig their Feva at Miami\u2019s Regatta Park, where\nthe after-race karate happens under the palms. Hannah Lee Noll\n\nCozzolino, who co-chairs Milford YC\u2019s junior sailing program, had rented a Feva\nlast summer for the sole purpose of keeping his son and nephew interested in\nsailing, but he discovered how much fun it was to be in the boat with the kids\nhimself. \u201cMy son had sized out of the Opti, and Peter wasn\u2019t happy being by\nhimself in the Laser,\u201d Cozzolino says. \u201cWhen I sailed with both of them in the\nFeva, they loved it, and the bigger Opti kids wanted to sail it too.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat was enough to \u00adconvince him to buy two boats from RS, and the deal was he\u2019d\ntake delivery at RS Fest Miami. \u201cThey were the ones who suggested we come to the\nregatta, and I\u2019m glad we did,\u201d Cozzolino says. \u201cIt was the first time where I,\nas a parent, was able to sail in an open class with the kids.\u201d\n\nGranted, he was the sole 42-year-old among teens and preteens, but he plans on\ndoing it again in Miami next year with his 9-year-old son, James. \u201cSailing\ntogether, parent and child, is a game-changer,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was the kids\u2019\nfirst travel event, and they thought it was so cool to have the other kids, the\ngiveaways, the games, and having the Aeros and the 21s around them. It gave them\nthe excitement to see what\u2019s next and to stay in the sport, which as a parent, I\nlove.\u201d\n\nThe unpretentious Coconut Grove Sailing Club off Bayshore Boulevard is where the\nsailors and families gather nightly after racing, enjoying the buffet, music and\ngames. International flags for the regatta visiting sailors (India, Ireland, the\nNetherlands, Britain, etc.) line the seawall for an Olympic-esque touch, and the\nclub\u2019s Astroturf lawn is partially covered by neon magenta shag carpeting, white\ntables and chairs, pingpong tables erected from shipping pallets and plywood,\nand two aluminum-framed hiking benches for the RS Fest Hiking Challenge. And\nhere, at the final awards, Geerling extends his gratitude to the sailors and\npromises that the RS Fest will be an ongoing thing somewhere and sometime in the\nnear future.\n\nHe invites all in attendance to come again, and Dan Falk, the towering,\nwhite-bearded Aero sailor from Seattle, shouts, \u201cOnly if it\u2019s Miami!\u201d The crowd\ncheers in agreement, and with this show of support, planning is ostensibly\nunderway.\n\n * More: One Design, Print Summer 2024, Racing, Sailboat Racing\n\n * More Racing\n\n\nREAD MORE\n\n",

The SPV is a subset of the India asset\nmanagement vehicle.\n\n\n\nELEVATE YOUR TECH PROWESS WITH HIGH-VALUE SKILL COURSES\n\nOffering CollegeCourseWebsiteIndian School of BusinessProfessional Certificate\nin Product ManagementVisitIIT DelhiCertificate Programme in Data Science &\nMachine LearningVisitMIT xPROMIT Technology Leadership and InnovationVisit\n\nThe SPV will invest $75 million in Shiprocket, where the fund is already the\nlargest shareholder, and the transaction will be finalised over the next few\nweeks, Sethi said. SPVs are legal entities created by pooling in funds and\ncommonly used by risk investors to buy specific assets.\n\nTribe Capital Management India Pvt Ltd \u2014 as the India asset management company\nis being called \u2014 will pump in a majority of the cash in Shiprocket\u2019s ongoing\nfunding round. The fundraising is likely to comprise primary and secondary\ntransactions, valuing the startup at $1.2 billion.\n\nETtech\n\nThe India management entity, which has been set up as a Gurugram-based company,\nis co-owned by Sethi, Shiprocket cofounder Vishesh Khurana and Raj Snehil\nJuneja, who has been investing in Indian startups.\n\n\n\nDISCOVER THE STORIES OF YOUR INTEREST\n\n * \n\n * \n\n * \n\n * \n\n * \n\n * \n\n\n\nTribe is also setting up an alternate investment fund (AIF), which is awaiting\napproval from capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India.\n\nET had first reported in May 2023 about Tribe Capital\u2019s plan to launch a $250\nmillion India-dedicated fund.\n\nTo be managed by Tribe Capital Management India, the AIF will aim to make five\nto eight investments across financial services, commerce and logistics sectors\nover five years.\n\n\u201cWe have carved out Tribe India as a separate management company\u2026and myself,\nVishesh and Raj will become owners of that\u2026 Tribe India\u2019s strategy will look\nvery similar to what we\u2019ve done in the US. There are companies that it will own\nand build\u2026and companies that it will invest in,\u201d Sethi said.\n\nThe development comes at a time when investors have been raising record funds \u2014\n$17.3 billion in 2022 and $16.5 billion 2023. But the share of venture\ncapitalists in this has shrunk over the two years as private equity firms have\nstepped up on fundraises, according to data sourced from Praxis Global Alliance.\n\nStructuring of vehicles\n\nTribe Capital Management India will operate multiple vehicles and own different\nentities, one of which will be the India AIF, called Tribe India Venture AIF\nFund I.\n\nThe India AIF will have an 80% overlap with Tribe Capital\u2019s global fund in terms\nof limited partners, or sponsors of the fund, to begin with, Sethi said. The AIF\nwill also rope in general partners to contribute to and manage the investments.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about the divestments from China, and the targets that you\nhave are Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and India. Specifically for India, a lot of\npeople have had slow starts and now they\u2019re coming back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of our LPs coming into companies in India is the first time they\u2019ve ever\ninvested here. These are large corporations, insurance companies, pension funds\nthat say they want to focus more on India and want more direct exposure to\ncompanies that are going public in certain sectors,\u201d he added.\n\nThe SPV will also set up various investment vehicles across Singapore, Dubai and\nthe US.\n\nIndia strategy\n\nTribe Capital, through its global funds, owns an 18% stake in Shiprocket, which\nit first backed in May 2020. It has also backed startups such as fintech\nplatform Khatabook and logistics firm Blackbuck.\n\n\u201cIn India, we\u2019ve invested through our global flagship funds, our co-investments,\nand our single managed accounts, which is what we do on behalf of our LPs.

Similarly,\ncurrent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Ethan\nGoldrich has highlighted Iran\u2019s destabilizing presence in Syria, where the Biden\nadministration approved plans to strike Iranian targets earlier this year.\n\nRecent unprecedented escalation between Israel and Iran in the context of the\nwar in Gaza highlights just one of many reasons the US seeks to limit Iran\u2019s\ninfluence\u2014both in Syria and in the region.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Washington\u2019s decision not to support Arab tribes in their 2023 revolt\nagainst its ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has created an opportunity\nfor Iran to expand in northeastern Syria\u2014one that it is eager to exploit.\u00a0\n\nTehran is skillfully taking advantage of American policy missteps to further its\ninterests in Syria, winning the support of Arab tribes in anticipation of a\nfuture US withdrawal.\n\nDEIR E-ZOR UPRISING\n\nEastern Syria is home to five main Arab tribes: the Uqaydat, the Baqqara, the\nJubour, the Shammar and the Tayy. While a general claim for the stance of any\ntribe cannot be made, the positions of the most prominent and powerful tribal\nleaders are significant. A common trend for each tribe is to have figures within\nit co-opted by a range of different actors. Some may work with the US and the\nSDF, while others work with Turkey and the Syrian opposition. Still others may\nalign themselves with Russia, Iran and the Assad regime.\n\nThese five tribes in eastern Syria comprise the vast majority of Arab residents\nin the area under the influence of the SDF\u2014and by extension its backer, the\nUS\u2014in Syria. Most of them, except parts of the Tayy tribe, are governed by the\nAutonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES).\u00a0\n\nThe AANES, a self-declared governing body, is dominated by the Kurdish\nDemocratic Union Party (PYD), whose armed wing, the People\u2019s Protection Units\n(YPG), is the main component of the SDF. The PYD was established as the Syrian\nbranch of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) in Turkey, which is listed as a\nterrorist organization by both Ankara and Washington. For this reason, many\nmembers of Arab tribes and clans refer to the YPG as the PKK.\n\nWhen an Arab tribal uprising broke out in SDF-held parts of Syria\u2019s eastern Deir\ne-Zor province on August 28, 2023, it ushered in a significant shift in the\nintricate power dynamics of northeastern Syria. This rebellion was triggered by\nthe arrest and imprisonment of Ahmed al-Khubail (Abu Khawla), the leader of the\nSDF-affiliated Deir e-Zor Military Council.\u00a0\n\nThe circumstances surrounding al-Khubail\u2019s detention shed light on the\ndeep-seated tensions and strategic maneuvers that define the ongoing conflict in\nthe region.\n\nOn August 27, the SDF invited al-Khubail and other top leaders to a meeting at a\nbase in Hasakah province following a two-month dispute. Once there, the group\nwas encircled and al-Khubail was arrested. This strategy\u2014inviting a target to a\nmeeting, only to detain them\u2014sparked widespread local resentment, particularly\nas it is similar to tactics previously used by the Islamic State (IS), as\nseveral tribesmen told the author.\n\nThe arrest came at a time of increasing tensions between the YPG and the Deir\ne-Zor Military Council. Al-Khubail\u2019s clan, al-Bakir, had taken action the month\nbefore against previous attempts to remove him from power. While al-Khubail\u2019s\ndetention was initially presented as a crackdown on corruption, the political\nwing of the SDF later stated that al-Khubail was arrested due to his alleged\nconnections with Iran and the Assad regime.\n\nInitially, the uprising resulted in significant territorial advances by the\nUqaydat and Baqqara tribes, which took control of the southern areas of Deir\ne-Zor and detained more than 100 SDF forces by September 3. Their main demands\nwere for the withdrawal of YPG forces, direct cooperation with the US, and\nefforts to liberate areas west of the Euphrates from Iranian and Assad regime\ncontrol.\n\nDuring nearly two weeks of clashes, tribes in Turkish areas of influence in\nnorthwestern Syria also mobilized. Groups from Idlib, Afrin and other areas\nlaunched attacks against the SDF, but their advances were short-lived due to\nRussian airstrikes. Moscow indicated that it would not allow pro-Turkish Arab\ntribal forces to intervene in the conflict against the YPG-dominated SDF. By\nSeptember 5, the SDF had reclaimed most of the territory it lost.\n\nIn an effort to restore calm, US officials facilitated an important meeting\nbetween SDF and tribal representatives on September 2-3. Key leaders of the\nuprising were notably excluded from this meeting. As a result of the\ndiscussions, the SDF announced conciliatory measures, releasing local fighters\nand issuing a general amnesty. Paradoxically, they also continued to detain\ninfluential tribal figures.\n\nUS military vehicles sent to reinforce SDF bases in northeastern Syria\u2019s Deir\ne-Zor province, 13/8/2023 (Omer Al Diri/Anadolu Agency/AFP)\n\nPERCEIVED AMERICAN BETRAYAL\n\nWhen the Arab tribes revolted against the SDF in Deir e-Zor, they had one main\nhope: that the US would support the Arab tribes and limit the YPG\u2019s influence in\nArab-dominated areas. Militarily, their chances against the YPG-dominated SDF\nwere limited. However, to the surprise of tribal forces, the US chose to side\nwith the YPG and SDF leadership.\u00a0\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State Ethan Goldrich and Combined Joint Task\nForce-Operation Inherent Resolve Commander Major General Joel B. Vowell attended\nthe September 2023 meeting in Deir e-Zor. They chose to ignore a negotiation\ncommittee set up by the Arab tribal forces, meeting instead with tribal\nrepresentatives selected by the SDF. These representatives had little real power\nor control over the tribes they claimed to represent.\u00a0\n\nFollowing the meeting, the US greenlit a forceful suppression of the revolt by\nthe SDF, which launched an offensive and recaptured territory it lost. The last\npocket of resistance, in the Deir e-Zor town of Dhiban, ended with the surrender\nof the Arab tribal forces. The uprising\u2019s leader, Ibrahim al-Hafel, fled to the\nregime-controlled western side of the Euphrates River to seek refuge among his\ntribespeople.\n\nThe tribesmen of Deir e-Zor formed a strong perception of an American betrayal.\nOne senior Uqaydat tribal figure told the author he now believes the US-led\ninternational coalition secretly supports Iranian expansion, conspiring with\n\u201cthe PKK\u201d to push the tribes towards Iran.\n\nThese beliefs seem to stem from a US policy mistake rather than a conspiracy.\nHowever, it is significant that such conspiracy theories are circulating in Deir\ne-Zor, and that senior tribal figures openly express them. A senior tribal\nfigure from the Baqqara tribe said: \u201cWere it not for the US, the PKK could not\nmaintain its control over us.\u201d\n\nAll sources contacted by the author asked to remain anonymous for fear of\nretaliation against themselves or their relatives.\u00a0\n\nIRAN STEPS IN\n\nAfter Ibrahim al-Hafel fled to the eastern side of the Euphrates River, Iran\nseized the opportunity and took action. Despite past animosity between al-Hafel,\nIran and the Assad regime, the latter\u2014under Iranian guidance\u2014enabled a\npermissive environment for tribal forces to attack the SDF-held side of the\nEuphrates River by using regime-held areas as a staging ground.\u00a0\n\nIran has since increased the level of cooperation from merely permitting access\nto facilitating direct engagement between the Assad regime and al-Hafel. This\npast February, al-Hafel met with pro-regime tribal figures in Damascus and\nagreed to coordinate action further. Since then, tribal forces loyal to him have\ncontinued to attack SDF forces and checkpoints in eastern Deir e-Zor.\n\nWhile employing this strategy in the Deir e-Zor region, Iran pursues similar\nends by other means further to the north. Northeastern Syria, particularly the\narea around the Hasakah province city of Qamishli, has a distinct demographic\nmakeup. In Qamishli, Kurdish populations are concentrated in the east and\nwest\u2014along the Turkish border\u2014while Arabs and Kurds live together in the city\ncenter. Most Arabs in this area belong to the Tayy tribe, which the Baath Party\nhistorically supported and settled in the area as part of its 1970s Arabization\npolicies. As a result, the regime\u2019s influence in the city persists through the\nTayy tribe\u2019s presence. Today, Qamishli is mainly SDF-controlled, while the\nregime maintains a presence at its airport and Tayy tribe neighborhoods.\u00a0\n\nHowever, conflicts occasionally arise between the National Defense Forces (NDF),\nmainly composed of the Tayy tribe, and the SDF, often resulting in SDF victory\nor Russian-mediated resolutions. Russian officers usually favor the SDF in these\nmediations. On the other hand, Iran directly supports the Tayy tribe. Recently,\nTehran-backed Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in the Qamishli area has provided military\ntraining and weapons to members of the tribe. Iran also pays salaries.\u00a0\n\nAs a soft-power tool, Iran deploys a propaganda effort towards the Tayy tribe,\nseeking a shared narrative based on historical events\u2014notably the Tayy tribe\u2019s\nsupport for Ali ibn Abi Talib in the seventh-century Battle of Siffin. By using\nthis narrative, Iran aims to circumvent Sunni-Shia differences and construct a\njoint history. Despite this support, the SDF holds logistical superiority in\nQamishli. Iran knows it cannot balance the SDF without direct Russian support,\nand is creating an alternative military presence for the Tayy tribe in Deir\ne-Zor, where new military formations are being established in areas dominated by\nIran-backed Shia militias.\n\nIt remains to be seen what impact, if any, the election of Iran\u2019s new reformist\npresident Masoud Pezeshkian could have on the country\u2019s Syria policy. What is\nclear is that Tehran has a long-term strategy of building relationships with\nArab tribes in preparation for a potential withdrawal of American forces from\nSyria. This appears unlikely to change. Like in neighboring Iraq, Iran has\nstrategically positioned itself to be ready to fill the void.\u00a0\n\nIran anticipates the US will not coordinate any withdrawal with Turkey, and aims\nto take advantage of an uncoordinated and abrupt pullout. To this end, Iran has\ndeployed militias it backs along the Euphrates River to ensure dominance in the\nregion. It has also strengthened its presence along the Iraqi-Syrian border by\nmobilizing Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) near the al-Qaim region and\nthe Sinjar Mountain. Additionally, Iran has invested in its relationship with\nthe aforementioned Tayy tribe in Qamishli, located near the Turkish-Syrian\nborder.\u00a0\n\nThe objective is clear: Once the Americans withdraw, Iran and its affiliates\ncould advance from the west, south and east while leveraging the Tayy tribe in\nthe north to reach the Turkish border before Ankara has the chance to launch an\nmilitary operation of its own into this part of Syria, as it has long\nthreatened. Limiting Turkish influence and presence in Syria is a geostrategic\nIranian goal. There is, however, a potential obstacle in the form of Arab tribes\neast of the Euphrates River who are not aligned with Iran. If they resist,\nIran\u2019s progress could be hindered, potentially preventing the forces it backs\nfrom reaching the Turkish-Syrian border in time.\u00a0\n\nIran\u2019s success hinges on speed and taking advantage of a sudden American\nwithdrawal. In that scenario, US forces are expected to exit from the south to\nthe north via the Fishkhabour crossing into Iraqi Kurdistan. If Iran can keep\npace, Turkey would be unable to intervene until the American withdrawal is\ncomplete.\n\nThe decision by the US not to support the aspirations of Arab tribes opposed to\nYPG domination worked in favor of Iran and provided it with a significant\nopportunity. With al-Hafel changing allegiance, the Uqaydat tribe will likely\nassist Iran in advancing east of the Euphrates. Between the Uqaydat and the Tayy\ntribes are the Baqqara, the Shammar, and the Jubour tribes. Iran is currently\nattempting to gain the support of these tribes as well.\n\nOTHER PLAYERS\n\nThe Baqqara tribe initially supported the Arab revolt against the YPG-dominated\nSDF, but later decided to reconcile with the SDF leadership. However, during\nthis process, the Baqqara tribe could not engage directly with the US as the SDF\nprevents the tribes from meeting American officials directly, limiting\ninteraction to only figures it approves. \u201cOnly Haj Bashir of our tribe can speak\nwith the Americans,\u201d one senior tribal figure from the Baqqara tribe told the\nauthor. Haj Bashir is the most senior tribal leader of the Baqqara tribe who\nchose to reconcile with SDF leadership.\n\nWhile the US limits its involvement by seeking approvals from SDF leadership,\nIran is increasingly engaging with the Baqqara. Tehran is using tribal leader\nNawaf al-Bashir as its representative to communicate with the Baqqara tribe and\nrecruiting tribesmen into its ranks, with the Liwa al-Baqir brigade seeing a\nrise in recruits. \u201cMany of our youth are choosing to join Iran to fight against\nthe PKK,\u201d the same Baqqara figure said.\n\nUnder Iranian auspices, in May the Assad regime organized a meeting of\ninfluential tribal figures, including Ibrahim al-Hafel of the Uqaydat tribe,\nSheikh Alaa al-Labad from the al-Boushaban tribe in Raqqa, and Subhi al-Hanan, a\nprominent member of the Baqqara tribe, and announced the formation of a new\nmilitary unit called Saraya al-Boushaban.\n\nWinning the Jubour and the Shammar tribes over has been more difficult. \u201cWe are\nagainst Iran, and we will not allow them to enter our areas,\u201d one senior Jubour\ntribe figure said. These sentiments are similar to those expressed by the\nUqaydat before the 2023 uprising and its fallout.\n\nThe Jubour tribe did not participate in the uprising, and thus avoided being\nsuppressed in its aftermath. If a similar incident or direct escalation between\nthe Jubour tribe and the SDF were to occur, it could lead to a similar outcome\nas it did with the Uqaydat.\n\nWhile this is true, one significant figure must be considered: Mahmoud\nal-Maslat, a member of the Jubour tribe\u2019s prominent Maslat family who previously\nresided in the US. Following the AANES\u2019 declaration of a new Social Contract in\nlate 2023, al-Maslat was chosen as the co-chair of the AANES\u2019 Syrian Democratic\nCouncil (SDC).\n\nMahmoud al-Maslat does not represent the entire Maslat family, however. Salem\nal-Maslat, who has a stronger claim on tribal leadership due to lineage, once\nled the Turkish-supported political Syrian opposition. Other family members,\nlike Rafek Mijer al-Maslat, Hasan al-Maslat, and Nawaf Abdulaziz al-Maslat, have\naligned themselves with Iran. They have some hundred men under arms fighting for\nIran in Syria, according to a senior tribal figure. In reaching out to the\nJubour tribe, he said Iran honors it from a religious perspective, emphasizing\nthe tribe\u2019s lineage to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\n\nThe Shammar tribe, meanwhile, differs from the other four tribes in eastern\nSyria. It is a Bedouin tribe with a long history of relations with the Kurds in\nthe area, supporting them during the Iraqi-Kurdish wars between 1961 and 1975.\nThe Shammar tribe is aligned with the SDF, helping them with their al-Sanadid\nForces.\n\nIn conclusion, the US strategy in Syria has inadvertently strengthened Iran\u2019s\ninfluence among the Arab tribes. By choosing to support the YPG-dominated SDF\nover the tribes during the 2023 uprising in Deir e-Zor, Washington has alienated\nthose who now perceive this as a betrayal. This perception has driven many\ntribal leaders to ally with Iran, which has been quick to exploit the situation\nby offering support and forming strategic relationships with them. Iran\u2019s\nlong-term strategy is to prepare for a potential US withdrawal by establishing a\nstrong presence through these alliances, thereby ensuring its regional\ndominance. The US\u2019 decision to unconditionally support the SDF has provided Iran\nwith a critical opportunity to expand its influence in Syria.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\n\nRELATED POSTS\n\nPage load link\nGo to Top",

        "content": "GRAND RPAIDS, MI \u2014 As Deidra Mitchell reflects on the past six years at\nWaseyabek Development Company, a tribal economic development group based in\nGrand Rapids that has seen big growth, she describes the period as a \u201cseries of\nbaby steps.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, a year after she took over as president and CEO of Waseyabek, the\neconomic development arm of the of the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi\ntribe, the firm was losing money and had three investments.\n\nToday, the picture is very different.\n\nThe firm\u2019s portfolio now includes 30 businesses with 446 employees, with annual\nrevenue of $92 million. It has also moved into federal contracting, the real\nestate business. Waseyabek has seven properties throughout the region, including\nMcKay Tower in downtown Grand Rapids, for retail, commercial and residential\nleasing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come so far,\u201d Mitchell said, noting the firm was launched in 2011 but\nbegan making investments in 2017. \u201cIt was this really long elaborate series of\nbaby steps.\u201d\n\nMitchell and her colleagues will be celebrating Waseyabek\u2019s progress today\nduring an event at McKay Tower. They will look back at the completion of the\ncompany\u2019s now complete five-year strategic plan, and talk about what the future\nholds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing so fast and becoming more and more complex that we don\u2019t\nalways take enough time to celebrate all the things that we have accomplished in\nthe list last five or six years,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of big goals in the firm\u2019s future.\n\nLooking forward, Waseyabek wants to grow its revenue from $92 million to $250\nmillion over the next five years, Mitchell said.\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s an even more substantial aim.\n\n\u201cWe have a really big goal of becoming a $1 billion, top-line revenue by 2040,\u201d\nMitchell said. \u201cThat is modeled out, and our mission is to support the\nNottawaseppi Huron Band of Potawatomi tribe. And so that is what we\u2019ve committed\nto accomplishing so that we can provide a certain level of dividends back to the\ntribe.\u201d\n\nRelated: Native American tribes purchase historic Grand Rapids tower\n\nWaseyabek was launched in 2011 by the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi.\nThe federally recognized tribe owns FireKeepers Casino Hotel near Battle Creek,\nand is based in Fulton, Michigan, about 30 miles southeast of Kalamazoo. The\ntribe has under 1,700 members, Mitchell said.\n\nThe firm is the economic development arm for the tribe\u2019s non-gaming activities.\nIt\u2019s designed to contribute to the Nottawaseppi\u2019s long-term success by\ndiversifying its revenue sources and providing employment opportunities for\ntribal members.\n\nDuring an interview, Mitchell spoke about some of the investments and\nadministrative actions that helped the firm reach $94 million in revenue, and\ndiscussed how Waseyabek plans to more than double the figure in five years.\n\nAfter coming on board in 2016, one of Mitchell\u2019s first tasks was to create the\nadministrative framework and build, alongside tribal leaders, a unified vision\nfor how Waseyabek should operate.\n\nAccounting systems were improved, she said. Expectations for how quickly the\nfirm\u2019s investments should generate a profit were managed. Revenue goals were\nset.\n\n\u201cThat requires a lot of thought, planning, guidance,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBecause\nI\u2019m managing a set of stakeholders that needs to have that same expectation \u2014\nnot have that goal of profitability by next Tuesday because then you get\nalignment.\u201d\n\nOver the past five years, investment highlights include the 2021 purchase of\nSafari Circuits, an Otsego-based company that provides electronics\nmanufacturing, engineering services and supply chain management.\n\nThere was also the 2020 purchase of McKay Tower. Waseyabek bought the\ncentury-old, 18-story landmark office building, located in the heart of downtown\nGrand Rapids, for $17.5 million in partnership with Gun Lake Investments, the\neconomic development arm of the Gun Lake Tribe.\n\nAnother key acquisition came in 2018 with the purchase of DWH, a business\nconsulting group based in Grand Rapids. It was Waseyabek\u2019s first business\nacquisition, and it came at a time when Waseyabek had just three employees and\nno income, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cWe had these really big growth plans, and I would need high caliber talent to\nget us through that,\u201d she said, describing her reason for purchasing the\nconsulting company. \u201cPurchasing them provided us this really trusted group of a\nwide array of professionals.\u201d\n\nSo, looking forward, how will Waseyabek grow its revenue from $92 million to\n$250 million in just five years?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure well see most of the growth coming out of our federal\ncontracting or defense vertical,\u201d Mitchell said, using the word vertical to\ndescribe a market segment. \u201cI see that as a big area of growth.\u201d\n\nWaseyabek is \u201cwaiting on some potential award announcements that are going to\njumpstart\u201d that push for $250 million revenue, Mitchell said.\n\nIn addition to those potential awards, Waseyabek Federal Services has an\nexisting federal contract with the U.S. Department of Energy. That contract is\nfor facility support services for agency campuses across the country, from\nOregon to West Viriginia, Mitchell said.\n\nWaseyabek also acquired a company, BLDI, in September that provides\nenvironmental consulting services. The company is based in Grand Rapids, and\nMitchell said Waseyabek plans to use its expertise to help the company expand\ninto the federal contracting space.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to make some really big leaps here in the next five years,\u201d\nMitchell said. \u201cI think even this next year, 2024, is going to be big for us.\u201d\n\nWant more Grand Rapids-area news?

The goal is to help steelhead spawn more than once.\n\nPlans to bring this new facility to life have been in the works for 16 years.\nAlongside the Yakama Nation, Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, and\nthe University of Idaho, the Nez Perce Tribe has been able to make this happen.\nThe project is the first in the basin focused on recovering the Snake River Wild\nSteelhead populations as they have declined in the past years.\n\nAbout two percent of the Columbia basin steelhead population can successfully\nspawn twice. Once they are done spawning many try to migrate to the ocean, but\nmany die due to obstacles faced at hydroelectric dams. This makes it difficult\nto find them in the Snake River and upper Columbia rivers.\n\nWith this new hatchery steelhead can become repeated spawners a part of their\ncycle that has become a challenge to accomplish due to predators, dams, and\nfishers.\n\nNez Perce Tribe Chairman Shannon Wheeler says these fish are an important part\nof their culture and helping them is a way to give back to the land for what it\nhas given.\n\n\" It's not a sport fish for us. This is a fish that we take to the dinner table\nthat we take for substance, and we take for the memories,\" Chairman Wheeler\nsaid.\n\nWhen the facility is complete the Nez Perce Department of Fisheries Resources\nManagement will collect out-migrated Kelts after spawning and bring them to the\nnew facility helping them increase feed to rise their survival rate and rebuild\nthe energy needed to repeat spawning.\n\nThen in the overwintering process Kelts will be released into the Snake River to\nensure the Kelts have enough spawning potential. A reconditioned steelhead Kelt\ncan produce 9,000 eggs compared to a first-time spawner's average of6,000 eggs.\n\nThe facility is expected to be completed in the spring of 2026 making it capable\nof long-term reconditioning for around 750 Steelhead Kelts on a budget of just\nunder one million dollars annually, while employing four full-time employees.",

Growth is driven by Health (+23%) and L&S (+23%) partly\noffset by P&C decline of 2 percent which is due to change in timing of booking\nof key business in the current period vs this time last year. The life and\nhealth business recorded 23 percent YoY growth resulting from improved customer\nretention rates, increased share on existing business and drive to acquire new\nbusinesses.\n\n\u201cGross revenues grew 20 percent YoY (34.4bn vs 28.6bn), revenue performance is\ndue to our ability to acquire new businesses as well as our capacity to renew\nexisting businesses. Growth is spurred by Health (+22%), L&S (+20%) and P&C\n(+19%). P&C volumes performance is attributable to improved performance in the\ncommercial lines growing by 17 percent YoY. Life volumes acceleration is spurred\nby increased onboarding on protection with savings products. Health volumes\nimproves owing to the impact of increased premium from re-pricing in the\ncommercial lines business.\n\n\u201cP&C improves 19 percent YoY due to significant improvements in the Oil & Energy\nportfolio, which grows by 25 percent and is partially offset by declines in\nAviation and Marine due to changes in the structure of key businesses. Growth\nwas also driven by increased premium on renewal, pricing changes, and new\nbusinesses.

        "link": "https://businessday.ng/news/legal-business/article/raising-capital-in-the-fmcg-sector-overview-of-key-considerations/",
        "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Sector represents one of the largest\nsector worldwide comprising companies that supply products that are in constant\nhigh demand such as food, beverages, personal hygiene and household items. From\na retailing perspective, FMCG is cited as a low marginhigh volume game. Within\nthese sub categories, FMCG products are often near-identical and for this reason\ncompetition can be intense.\n\nSeeing as profit margins are usually slim, firms operating within this space\nfocus on driving top line sales. To boost profitability, FMCG companies adopt\nvaried strategies to drive product loyalty and in turn improve sales revenue.\n\nGiven the intense competition and emphasis in growing sales volume, the need for\ninvestment in capital assets and maintaining operational liquidity is intrinsic\nto creating competitive advantages for companies in this sector, hence the\nimportance of expanding into new frontiers and markets cannot be overemphasized.\n\nA corporate entity interested in expanding its business frontiers and increasing\nits revenue base has to consider various capital raising options. The key\nconsideration in choosing a source of business finance is to strike a balance\nbetween equity and debt to guarantee that the finance structure suits the\ncorporate entity\u2019s business and also to ensure that it continues to thrive as a\ngoing concern. Below, we examine the dynamics of raising capital including\nidentifying the right mode, capital and investor type as well as those\nconsideration that are germane to a successful capital raise.\n\nWHEN TO RAISE CAPITAL\n\nWhile timing is key in raising capital and there is no specific period to\ncommence the process, there are important milestones the Company should set out\nto achieve. The company needs to have figured out its plans and feasibility,\nspent some time in the market, studying trends and profiles, undertake and\nanalyse sales and growth projections, and articulate its objectives for raising\ncapital. What is most important to raise funds is to be able to persuade the\ninvestors and convince them that the company can optimize resources in such a\nway that will catalyse actual growth in sales revenue.\n\nOPTIONS AND KEY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe options available to a company interested in raising finance can be capped\nunder two broad headings which are:\n\n(a) Equity Financing and (b) Debt Financing.\n\nEquity Financing essentially is raising money through the issuance of either\nordinary or preference shares (these could be redeemable or irredeemable) by the\ncompany which is then bought by individual investors or institutional investors\ne.g. Pension Funds, Private Equity Firms, Venture Capitalists etc in return for\nmoney and these can be achieved through any of the following platforms e.g.\nInitial Public Offer (IPO), Rights Issue, Private Placement. This form of\nfinancing is attractive for the following reasons\n\n\u2022 Increased public awareness of the company because IPOs often generate\npublicity by making their products known to a new group of potential customers\n\n\u2022 It helps create shareholder value\n\n\u2022 Equity capital need not be repaid, unless the company is liquidated and can\nperpetually use it to grow the business\n\n\u2022 Increase in the capitalization of the company.\n\nHowever, there are certain drawbacks:\n\nRelated News\n * What Opay-Guinness partnership means for FMCG market in Nigeria\n * Unilever bounces to profitability after 9-month loss of N2.06bn in 2020\n * Makers of FMCGs face tougher choices as VAT increase kicks in\n\n\u2022 Raising equity finance can be demanding, costly and time consuming.\n\n\u2022 Leads to a dilution in shareholding of existing shareholders.\n\n\u2022 Depending on the investor profile, equity financing may lead to loss of\ncontrol.\n\n\u2022 Imposition of onerous reporting standards by the company to investors and\nregulators\n\nDebt financing on the other hand is a process that enables a company to raise\nfinance by direct borrowing from financial institutions or through the issuance\nof debt instruments.\n\nThis form of financing could take the form of Bond Issuance, Loan Notes,\nConvertibles Asset Finance, Loan Syndication, Bills, and Mezzanine Financing.\nThe predominant issue with this form of financing is the issue of security as\nthere is usually recourse to the assets of the company if the company is unable\nto meet its debt obligations. This form of financing is attractive as business\nowners can retain maximum control over business without worrying about diluting\nownership interest. The interest payments on debt financing are also tax\ndeductible. The lenders/ providers of debt do not share in profit and managerial\ndecisions are shared neither with the creditors nor with debt holders. Raising\ndebt capital has proven to be more economical (except in the case of variable\nrate loans) as principal and interest obligations are known beforehand hence\neasily the company plan based on its cashflow.\n\nHowever, there are certain drawbacks: unlike equity, debt must at some point be\nrepaid. The larger a company\u2019s debt-equity ratio, the riskier the company is\nconsidered by fresh lenders and investors. Too much debt in a company can erode\nits value and lead to insolvency.\n\nDebt financing documents also often contain restrictions on the company\u2019s\nactivities, thus preventing management from pursuing alternative financing\noptions and non-core business opportunities. The company is usually required to\npledge asses of the company as collateral and owners of the company are in some\ncases required to personally guarantee repayment of the loan.\n\nConclusion\n\nIrrespective of whatever finance method a company adopts i.e. either debt or\nequity, the overall contemplation for a business when considering its finance\noptions is to avoid exposing the business to excessive high borrowings but\nwithout necessarily diluting its share capital.\n\nIt is very important for a company to consider its strategy for capital raising\noptions before deciding on how to finance its activities.\n\nAdditionally, having the right set of professional advisers generally helps in\nthe capital raising process and removing as much uncertainty or risk for\ninvestor or financiers will encourage investment and potentially reduce the cost\nof capital as a lower perception of risk, commands a lower premium on the\ncapital.\n\nFor further information, questions and clarifications, please contact:\n\nObafemi Agaba\n\nSector Head, Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) [email\u00a0protected]\n\n",

It is, therefore, understandable\nthat government will explore every avenue to enhance its revenue sources.\nHowever, it is always important to find the right equilibrium between revenue\ngeneration and economic growth. Otherwise, the country will not achieve\nsustainable growth,\u201d Ajayi said in the March 2024 note issued by the firm.\n\nKPMG noted in the publication that despite assurances from the Presidential\nCommittee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms that no new taxes would be\nintroduced, the sudden imposition of the levy has raised concerns about the\nimplication on business operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is always important that such significant policy change is supported by an\nenactment of the National Assembly. Also, the timing of reforms is extremely\nimportant. Given the headwinds facing businesses now, this may not be the best\ntime to introduce such a levy. Otherwise, the current challenges will be\nexacerbated and may result in disruptions to business operations,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nOn the government\u2019s decision to denominate the levy in US dollars instead of\nNigerian naira, Ajayi expressed fear that it could exacerbate currency exchange\nchallenges and inflation rates.\n\n\u201cThe EEL may potentially impact many organisations negatively, especially as it\nis already challenging to sustain the payment of the $2,000 statutory fee to\nobtain residence permits (CERPAC forms) for non-ECOWAS nationals annually, given\nthe current foreign exchange challenges in the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to note that payment for a residence permit is made in its\nnaira equivalent. As of the time of this publication, a CERPAC form costs\n\u20a63,196,000 (exclusive of bank commission. of N5,000). The annual naira\nequivalents of the EEL are \u20a616,000,000 and \u20a623,000,000 per non director and\ndirector level expatriate respectively, based on the prevailing exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHe held that if the government favours the payments to be made in naira, it\ncould help address this issue of dollarising the economy.\n\nRelated News\n * Three Nigerian startups receive NSIA\u2019s $220,000 for innovation\n * Again, have you called your parents today? -2\n * The necessities and gains for domestic petroleum products refining in\n   economies with abundant hydrocarbon\n\n\u201cWhile stakeholders await more clarity on the implementation of the EEL,\norganizations with expatriates who meet the eligibility requirements need to\nurgently take proactive action to review the impact of this development on their\nbusinesses and take appropriate action to avoid penalties that may arise from\nnon-compliance,\u201d Ajayi noted.\n\nIn February, President Bola Tinubu launched the Expatriate Employment Fund\n(EEL), an initiative to check the influx of expatriates, curb insecurity and\nraise funds.\n\nThe policy meant that businesses that employ expatriate workers in Nigeria are\nto $15,000 (N24 million) beginning March 15, 2024.\n\nThe fees, documented in a handbook released by the ministry of interior, says\nthat employers will be required to pay $15,000 for expatriates at the director\nlevel and $10,000 for those at other levels annually. The levy is an ad valorem\nand will be based primarily on the offshore earnings of expatriates working in\nNigeria.\n\nThe EEL will serve as a mandatory document, like a passport that expatriates\nwill be required to present to be allowed exit or entry into Nigeria. Employers\nare required to register their expatriate employees through an online reporting\nportal, before April 15, 2024.\n\nThe document also reveals penalties for non-compliance with the policy including\nimprisonment for up to 5 years or fines ranging from \u20a61,000,000 for inaccurate\nor incomplete reporting to \u20a63,000,000 for various offences such as failure to\nfile, register, or renew the EEL within specified timeframes, as well as\nsubmitting forged information.\n\nAccording to the government, the Project will be operated on a Public Private\nPartnership (PPP) model between the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN)\nrepresented by the Federal Ministry of Interior (FMI) as the guarantor while the\nNigeria Immigration Service (NIS) will oversee its implementation.\n\nThe levy seeks to promote skills transfer and knowledge sharing, balance\neconomic growth and social welfare, enhance collaboration between public and\nprivate sectors and address demographic shifts\n\n",
        "summary": "Professional services firm KPMG has raised concern over Nigeria Government\u2019s reintroduction of the Expatriate Employment Levy (EEL) The firm said it will provide the relevant information on the revenue potential of such levy, the related cost, and the impact on businesses.

        "content": "BW FILE PHOTO\n\nIt is well and good for some members of the Lower House to talk about the role\nof the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) in mobilizing savings to finance\n\u201cbig-ticket infrastructure works and other priority development programs of the\ngovernment\u201d if \u2014 and this is a big if \u2014 indeed the idea could produce new money\nto mitigate what some of them described as limited fiscal space.\n\nPerhaps it would be useful to know that there are no public savings to speak of\nin the first place. The Philippines is not a recipient of windfall profits from\nasset sales or privatization. No royalties are remitted to the national treasury\nfrom oil or gold or diamonds the way regular sovereign wealth funds derive\nsupport from their governments. What we have is chronic fiscal deficit and\nburgeoning public debt. Our external payments position due to unfavorable\nmerchandise trade and financial accounts remains in big, big deficit.\n\nThe original proponents in the Lower House must have realized this because they\nattempted at first to source the funding from the pension funds of both the GSIS\nand the SSS (Government Service Insurance System and Social Security System),\nsomething that the Supreme Court in previous rulings considered to be\nunconstitutional because private property is to be deployed for public use\nwithout just compensation. There was also an attempt to include as source the\ngross international reserves of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), an action\nwhich runs counter to the Constitution and the central bank\u2019s own charter which\nboth grant it autonomy and independence, and mandate it to promote the stability\nof consumer prices, the financial system, and the exchange rate. Both features\nof the original House version of the bill were subsequently dropped.\n\nWhy the Lower House opted to continue with this idea is perplexing.\n\nAs approved by 279 representatives with only six objecting, House Bill 6608\nsustained the view that there are savings to invest. For the Lower House,\nrequiring both the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP),\nboth government financial institutions (GFIs), to contribute some P75 billion\nand mandating the dividends of the BSP, PAGCOR (Philippine Amusement and Gaming\nCorp.) and other government-owned gambling enterprises will allegedly result in\nadditionality of public savings. But under the one-fund concept pursuant to\nPresidential Decree 1177, all these dividends are already part of government\nrevenues that must accrue to the General Fund for financing the budget.\n\nAssigning by law their future dividends to the Maharlika Investment Fund will\nnot only violate the Dividend Law of 1993 and undermine their ability to deliver\non their mandates, but it will also force the government to borrow to compensate\nfor the loss of dividend income.\n\nWhat is it in the Maharlika fund that has suddenly made it a \u201ccomplementary\nvehicle,\u201d following the endorsement of National Economic and Development\nAuthority (NEDA) chief Arsi Balisacan, to support the Philippines\u2019 economic\ngrowth trajectory. He hopes more foreign investments will be encouraged to\ninvest locally, augment domestic resources, and finance various social problems\nincluding poverty. \u201cSolving poverty\u2026 requires a lot of investment, and that\u2019s\nwhat we are trying to do.\u201d\n\nWe are not sure which version would produce such a \u201ccomplementary vehicle\u201d to\nrally foreign investments.\n\nThe Senate version is the mirror image of House Bill 6608 \u2014 to be introduced\nreportedly by Senator Mark Villar \u2014 which provides for public funding, future\nspecial tax assessments on natural resources, and possible borrowings by the\nMIF. Public funding from the GFIs, BSP, and gambling institutions are not new\nmoney. Special tax assessments on natural resources are dependent on the actual\nmining output which may take time. Borrowings will simply make the whole concept\nuntenable because MIF is supposed to generate and invest surplus funds.\n\nYes, more sounds better but in infrastructure alone, the government is already\nlooking at spending P1.248 trillion for 2023. It is important for the executing\nagencies for infrastructure and social services to have the absorptive capacity\nto undertake all these ambitious spending program. What the MIF effectively does\nis to increase the budget deficit and motivates higher borrowings. How then can\nthe government achieve its fiscal sustainability targets in terms of lower\nfiscal deficit to GDP ratio and public debt to GDP ratio?\n\nThis could be a drag to economic growth.\n\nWhat is it in the Maharlika fund that made it timely for the NEDA chief who also\nrecognized the challenges of \u201cglobal recession and high interest rates?\u201d\n\nTrue, any period, whether tumultuous or calm, is a time to invest as long as\nthere is something to place in fixed-income securities, equities, or even in\nspeculative plays in commodities and metals. Unfortunately, we have none of such\nsurplus funds. And since running the Maharlika will force the government to\nborrow in a high-interest rate environment, it is best to avoid exposure to\nhighly volatile and uncertain capital markets.\n\nWhat is it in the Maharlika fund that all of a sudden, some parties in\ngovernment saw in it the possibility of doing something \u201cbeyond business as\nusual, that we need to be ambitious compared to what we have been doing for the\npast four decades?\u201d\n\nWe should recall that the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 laid down our\nroadmap for sustainable and inclusive economic growth at between 6-7% in 2023\nand 6.5-8% for 2024 through 2028 and reduce unemployment to a low 4-5% in the\nlast few years of the Marcos administration. Yes, there are new elements most\nobvious in the country\u2019s latest Development Plan including learning from the\nlessons of the past few years of the pandemic, addressing the economic scars,\nbuilding on, yes, \u201ctried and tested\u201d strategies, and pursuing \u201cunfinished\nbusiness\u201d while being mindful of the emerging global and regional trends. The\nwhole plan aims at economic and social transformation for a prosperous,\ninclusive, and resilient society.\n\nThe new plan targets these lofty goals, and we all share them, with great\nconfidence \u2014 but without a Maharlika fund.\n\nClearly, MIF does not seem to be necessary as it hardly meets any social demand\nas enunciated in the plan and its narrative is quite flawed in several respects.\nGFIs and the BSP have been investing all these years using their own treasuries\nand traders. Foreign investors can very well leverage on existing PPP\n(public-private partnerships) or BOT (build operate transfer) schemes to engage\nin infrastructure development in the Philippines. Serving as a big brother who\nknows the Philippines as an investment ground is the job of both the Board of\nInvestments and Philippine Export Processing Zone. The Department of Trade and\nIndustry should also be helpful here.\n\nWhat new things the Maharlika fund will contribute escape us.\n\nThere is a term to explain our common failing to discern what we are seeing\ntoday: strategic misrepresentation. What is not being said is more important\nthan what we hear being trumpeted around town.\n\nDiwa C. Guinigundo is the former deputy governor for the Monetary and Economics\nSector, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). He served the BSP for 41 years.\nIn 2001-2003, he was alternate executive director at the International Monetary\nFund in Washington, DC. He is the senior pastor of the Fullness of Christ\nInternational Ministries in Mandaluyong.",

Oil production on\nOMLs 4, 38, 40 and 41 outperformed expectations, benefitting from low pipeline\nlosses and deferments, which were ahead of plan.

        "title": "Dominic Ng: MADE IN AMERICA",
        "link": "https://labusinessjournal.com/finance/banks/dominic-ng-made-america/",
        "content": "Business Person of the Year: Dominic Ng\n\nIn spring 2008, Dominic Ng was forced to confront some frightening scenarios.\n\nThe country\u2019s then-unfolding real estate bust suddenly highlighted two\npotentially dangerous mistakes by the chairman and chief executive of East West\nBancorp Inc. Not only had Ng led his bank company headlong into the construction\nloan bubble, but he had also compounded the risk by shifting his attention away\nfrom operations and toward a search for his successor.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of mistake and timing,\u201d he said. \u201cI stopped attending a\nlot of day-to-day operation and committee meetings, trying to do the best I\ncould to act like a visionary CEO and just look at big-picture stuff. But just\nby taking my eyes off the details a little bit in 2006, we were having some\nchallenges in 2008.\u201d\n\nThe Pasadena holding company was going to have to take some heavy losses. But Ng\nmoved quickly. Well before his peers began getting a grip on the impending\ncrisis, East West wrote down tens of millions in loans, raised hundreds of\nmillions in capital, performed stress tests, and reappraised its construction\nand development loan portfolios.\n\nThe bank reported a $59 million loss in 2008, its first unprofitable year and a\nlow point in Ng\u2019s career. Because most other banks weren\u2019t taking such painful\naction at the time, his moves made the bank appear troubled at first. It became\na target for short sellers on Wall Street.\n\nBut the swift early reaction strengthened the company\u2019s balance sheet through\nthe rest of the crisis. While other banks were swooning in 2009, struggling to\nassess and write down bad loans \u2013 and going into a stressed market to raise\nmoney \u2013 Ng\u2019s bank was already recovering and had returned to profitability by\nthat year\u2019s end.\n\nThe early corrective measures also put the bank on solid footing with investors\na year later, making possible Ng\u2019s boldest stroke. In 2009, he raised $500\nmillion in capital and orchestrated the bank\u2019s acquisition of its closest\ncompetitor, San Francisco\u2019s failed United Commercial Bank, doubling the size of\nEast West overnight.\n\n\u201cIt was undoubtedly one of the best deals to come out of the financial crisis,\nif not the best,\u201d said Aaron Deer, an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill\u2019s San Francisco\noffice.\n\nToday, East West is the country\u2019s largest Asian-American bank with more than $22\nbillion in assets, unrecognizable from the small savings and loan that Ng took\nover as a 32-year-old hired gun in 1991. Measured by assets, East West has\nballooned to become the second largest bank company in Los Angeles; City\nNational Corp., with assets of more than $23 billion, is first. But if measured\nby market capitalization, East West is biggest, with $3.5 billion compared with\nCity National\u2019s $2.9 billion.\n\nFor those reasons, the Business Journal has chosen Ng as its Business Person of\nthe Year. He will join the newspaper\u2019s Business Hall of Fame at a lunch March\n29.\n\nNg, 53, has built the bank into what it is today by marketing it as a financial\nbridge between Asia and the United States, its growth driven by commercial\nlending to U.S. businesses interested in attracting Asian investors or expanding\nin Asia.\n\nIn many ways, Ng\u2019s personal story is one of bridging East and West. He came to\nthe United States from Hong Kong three decades ago to study, with limited\nEnglish skills but a genuine curiosity about American culture, and never left.\nToday, he is involved in civic and philanthropic causes dedicated to improving\nU.S.-China relations. As he takes steps now to find a successor at East West, he\nfigures in the future he\u2019ll continue working to forge those relations. It\u2019s a\ntask, he said, that has become his calling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural progression. Not only do I think of L.A. as my home, I\u2019ve lived\nin L.A. longer than any other place,\u201d he said. \u201cBut being an Asian bank or being\nan Asian executive, the challenge is there\u2019s always the perpetual foreigner\nissue.\u201d\n\nBanker\u2019s persona\n\nUp close, Ng seems every bit the banker. He keeps his slim figure attired in\nwell-fitted suits and his slicked-back hair is so impeccably coiffed it could\nmake Mitt Romney jealous. Ever friendly, he is warm without being effusive,\nbreaking frequently into an easy and quiet laugh. He is cautious about his\npublic persona, often asking for clarifications of seemingly simple questions\nduring an interview.\n\nNg runs a tight, disciplined ship, too. His brightly lit office overlooking\nEuclid Avenue in Pasadena is kept scrupulously clean. During his interview with\nthe Business Journal, there were no interruptions by staff, save for two\nwarnings that the meeting was threatening to run over into another appointment.\nHis desk and cell phones didn\u2019t ring in more than two hours.\n\nHe has a sharp and analytical mind, but would have you believe he doesn\u2019t often\nturn it on himself. When asked what his best quality as an executive is, he took\na long pause, explaining, \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me about that before.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t ever spend time to think about, \u2018Do I like to do this or\nthat? What\u2019s my personal profile? Introvert or extrovert?\u2019 I don\u2019t think about\nthis kind of stuff. I do what is needed.\u201d\n\nNor is he very forthcoming about his personal life. He did not make available\nhis wife, brother or other family members for interviews.\n\n\u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want to have anything to do with business,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a\nvery strong principle that family is outside of business.\u201d\n\nBut the buttoned-down banker image belies a capacity for reflection, someone\nwho\u2019s thought about the challenges, mistakes, and highs and lows of his life. As\nthe interview lengthened, Ng\u2019s answers grew longer and more frank. He discussed\na host of personal and professional challenges, beginning with his working-class\nchildhood in Hong Kong and his assimilation into America. He also spoke about\nthe struggles to guide East West from an ethnic bank into a more mainstream\ninstitution, including his fights against racially tinged community opposition\nand criticism that the bank does not do enough for other minorities.\n\nIn many ways, Ng\u2019s story follows the classic rags-to-riches narrative.\n\nHe grew up as the youngest of six children in Hong Kong. His parents were among\nthe 1 million people who fled there from communist China in 1949 and were forced\nto remake themselves. Ng\u2019s mother, who came from a wealthy family in Shanghai,\nsuddenly found herself penniless. His father drove a school bus; his mother\nsewed school uniforms. The first apartment Ng can remember was no bigger than a\nfew hundred square feet.\n\nBut the family\u2019s fortunes improved. Both of his parent\u2019s enterprises became\nsmall businesses, and his father eventually owned a small fleet of buses. Ng\nhelped out, too. A good student, he worked as a tutor in several different\nsubjects, while his older siblings got jobs at local factories during Hong\nKong\u2019s manufacturing boom. He credits the work ethic in his household for some\nof his business views.\n\n\u201cA lot of the American executives who are very successful have this sort of\nexuberant attitude that \u2018Trust me, things are going to get better,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t. I only believe one thing: You work really, really hard and you ensure\nthere is so much cushion and reserve that, chances are, there is no chance you\nwill fall. That has a lot to do with how I grew up.\u201d\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t resistant to Western influences. He was exposed early to rock\nmusic, sparking a lifetime passion of playing and collecting guitars. He played\nin bands with his friends, listening to Beatles and Elvis Presley records over\nand over as he learned the notes.\n\nWhen it came time to go to college, Ng only applied to one: the University of\nHouston, from where his oldest brother, John, had graduated. He became part of a\nwave of Hong Kong students who came to the United States in the 1970s, the first\ngeneration born of displaced Chinese nationals.\n\nIn college, most of his friends were Chinese, but he began to integrate into\nAmerican culture, taking a tutor job teaching math to football players, playing\nbass in the church choir and switching his major to communications from chemical\nengineering.\n\n\u201cIt was a shocking revelation to my friends and my brother because not a single\nperson they knew of had ever majored in communications,\u201d he said, noting that\nmost of them studied engineering, pharmacy and accounting.\n\nHe was fascinated by why American audiences liked certain TV shows, realizing\nthat some shows responded faster to cultural changes in the audience. He sees a\nparallel in his marketing of East West as a bank that prioritized the growing\nsignificance of U.S.-China trade and investment.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Mary Tyler Moore Show\u2019 and \u2018All in the Family\u2019 were fresh and\ndifferentiated themselves clearly from the competition at that time,\u201d he said.\nIn much the same way, East West was striving to be fresh for its audience.\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to have business development for the era.\u201d\n\nStarting in business\n\nBut before long, his brother convinced him to switch his major again to\naccounting, which would offer the best chance to get a job and stay in the\ncountry. Dominic didn\u2019t care much for it, but it did help him get a job. He was\nheavily recruited out of college, and accepted an offer to work as an accountant\nfor Touche Ross & Co. because the company agreed to sponsor him through the H1\nwork visa program and later helped him get a green card.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he was recruited out to its L.A. office, where he headed\nits China business practice. Rich Thomas, a partner who was Ng\u2019s supervisor in\nLos Angeles, remembers Ng as a relentless networker.\n\n\u201cA lot of people get lunch together every day and they develop little niche\ngroups. Dominic was always a guy that would go out and try to meet new people,\u201d\nhe said, recalling how Ng approached one of his clients, the president of a\nlocal bank.\n\n\u201cDominic would go to him and say, \u2018I\u2019m just a poor little Chinese guy in Los\nAngeles who\u2019s trying to be successful. Would you invite me to one of your events\nand introduce me to some of your crowd?\u2019\u201d said Thomas, now the chief financial\nofficer of Citizens Business Bank. \u201cThen he would take the first six contacts\nand have them introduce him to more and more contacts.\u201d\n\nBut Ng had a fun side, too, Thomas recalled. He was known among co-workers for\nhis prowess at karaoke nights, singing Beatles songs and playing guitar after\nthey worked on long audits together.\n\nIt was through client referrals that Ng began working with the Nursalim family,\nthe wealthy owners of Indonesian tire company Gajah Tunggal. The family was\nlooking to buy banks in the United States. He never met them personally for the\nfirst year and a half, staying in contact mostly via their staff in Singapore.\n\nHe first helped the family buy United Pacific Bank in Los Angeles. His work\nimpressed them enough that they recruited him to head up their U.S. investment\narm, Seyen Investment Inc. He resisted at first, but eventually was convinced to\ntake the job in 1990. In 1991, he helped engineer the purchase of East West, and\nthen, at only 32, became its chief executive.\n\nDespite his youth and inexperience in banking, and an emphasis on seniority in\nAsian culture, he characterized the transition as a relatively smooth one.\n\n\u201cA 32-year-old going into a bank as a professional hired gun gives the employees\na very different impression than if my parents owned the bank,\u201d Ng said. \u201cAs\nmuch as they might have had skepticism, I was the boss and I was in charge of\nmaking strategic decisions. So the people who were supposed to follow, at the\nend of the day, had to follow as part of their job requirement. I wouldn\u2019t call\nit difficult at all.\u201d\n\nPivotal times\n\nWhen the bank was bought by his former bosses for $40 million, it had $600\nmillion in assets and roughly 200 employees, a fraction of its size today. Early\non, Ng envisioned a switch from a Chinese-American savings and loan to a\ncommercial bank that could tap into mainstream business.\n\nBut the company couldn\u2019t compete directly against the Wells Fargos of the world.\nIt had only one real advantage \u2013 familiarity with Asian clients and business\nplayers. So it began targeting U.S. clients interested in Asian investors or\nAsian business clientele.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started to set the vision to make East West the bridge between\nEast and West, I think a lot of people thought I was smoking too much of the\nwrong stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had done a decent job in the established community in\nthe Chinese-American region, so why jump to the other side?\u201d\n\nBut he had early success. In 1994, Beverly Hills real estate firm Kennedy Wilson\nmoved its banking relationships from Bank of America to East West.\n\n\u201cIt was a pivotal time for him,\u201d said William McMorrow, Kennedy Wilson\u2019s\nchairman. \u201cHe was trying to demonstrate to the greater L.A. business population\nthat they weren\u2019t just a Chinese bank.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, the Asian economic crisis hit the Nursalims hard and they began looking\nto sell their U.S. assets. Ng seized the opportunity to lead a group of\ninstitutional investors in buying East West for $238 million, throwing in about\n$1 million of his money. Within six months, the bank company went public and was\nlisted on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nThe holding company kept growing, averaging about an acquisition a year after\nthat. In 2001, the bank company bought Prime Bank of Los Angeles for $14.5\nmillion, taking over an institution that mainly catered to non-Asian businesses\nand had more than $100 million in assets. Two years later, it picked up Pacific\nBusiness Bank of Santa Fe Springs.\n\nEast West produced record profits year after year, though it only had two\nbranches outside of California, including one in Hong Kong.\n\nThen came the 2009 acquisition of United Commercial, which doubled East West\u2019s\nassets and gave the bank a presence in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Seattle and\nmainland China. Today, the publicly traded company has 2,300 employees in 127\nbranches.\n\nEye for detail\n\nThough it took a good deal of fortune and timing, Ng\u2019s success is not a fluke.\nWhether he\u2019s handling client relationships or managing employees, he\u2019s known for\nmeticulous attention to detail. It\u2019s a trait that clients and analysts say he\nhas instilled in the bank\u2019s culture.\n\nTake his loan agreement with Sam Nazarian\u2019s SBE Entertainment Group, an L.A.\nowner and operator of hotels, nightclubs and restaurants. In 2009, Nazarian was\nforced to scale back plans to transition from being a nightclub operator to a\nfull-fledged hospitality company due to the downturn and credit crunch. He had\ntrouble finding lending but was able to secure financing with East West \u2013 after\nmuch in-person due diligence by Ng.\n\n\u201cHe took a bet on me,\u201d Nazarian said. \u201cBut he took the time to meet with our\nexecutives and understood our business. He understood our product and its\nrelevancy and scalability. No other bank chairman would be going on specific\nproperty tours and sitting in on organizational meetings and investor committee\nmeetings.\u201d\n\nSince then, Nazarian\u2019s loan business with East West has quadrupled. What was a\nmostly local company with 14 properties now has 39 in five states, and is\ndeveloping hotels in Miami and Las Vegas under his SLS brand. As Nazarian has\nbegun planning for international expansion, he has tapped Ng\u2019s connections in\nAsia. And he said Ng still follows up with feedback on his products, such as the\nUmami Burger chain in which SBE owns a stake.\n\n\u201cHe makes time to go to Studio City Umami and grab burgers and let me know the\ngood and the bad,\u201d he said.\n\nNg also goes beyond the call, forging close personal relationships with clients\nsuch as Ming Shin Kou, chief operating officer of seafood importer Red Chamber\nGroup, one of the largest private companies in Los Angeles. The two talk\nbusiness and family, and Kou recalled how Ng called to console him after an\nemployee issue several years ago.\n\n\u201cI was feeling betrayed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe called to comfort me and share his\nthoughts and his experiences. Things like that you really appreciate and you\nremember for a long time.\u201d\n\nAlthough, he admits to taking his eye off the ball in the run-up to the\nfinancial crisis, Ng typically is a micromanager.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very hands-on,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect a lot from our staff, so I would say, in\ngeneral, they may think I\u2019m pretty tough.\u201d\n\nEmily Wang, East West\u2019s head of marketing, said Ng is particularly hands-on with\nthe bank\u2019s marketing, keeping an eye on the budget and outlining strategy such\nas staying away from media advertising to instead emphasize events.\n\n\u201cI got trained to be very cost-conscious and also very bottom line driven,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging working for him. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nGordon de Lang, head of Southern California commercial banking for East West,\nsaid the bank\u2019s culture is highly demanding.\n\n\u201cDominic sets an extremely challenging environment,\u201d said de Lang, who came over\nfrom American Express six years ago. \u201cHe\u2019s relentless about wanting people to\nachieve.\u201d\n\nMissteps and misunderstandings\n\nBut there have been growing pains as well. The year that it went public, the\nbank entered into an agreement with First Union Securities in which First Union\nagreed to begin analyst coverage of East West in exchange for $10 million in\ninvestment banking business. That coverage was never initiated, resulting in a\nlawsuit that was ultimately settled.\n\nNg said the dispute and the experience of taking the bank public made him wary\nof Wall Street.\n\n\u201cWe learned our lesson, that these people cannot be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nHis efforts to grow the bank beyond its Chinese-American roots haven\u2019t always\nbeen welcomed either. In 2007, as the bank was preparing to buy\nVictorville-based Desert Community Bank, it ran into community opposition in the\nmostly Latino area to \u201cAsian\u201d banks as well as criticism for not doing enough\nfor other minority groups.\n\nOne local radio host protested the action as \u201ca dirty little trick,\u201d complaining\nthat \u201cwe are going to see more Chinese faces in the bank than ever before.\u201d\n\nBerkeley advocacy group the Greenlining Institute protested the acquisition,\nsaying East West did not make enough loans to non-Asian businesses, and\nconvinced Congressman Joe Baca to send a letter to the Federal Reserve\nrequesting hearings.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t have the staffing or expertise or the culture to serve a mostly\nLatino community,\u201d said Robert Gnaizda, then the general counsel for\nGreenlining.\n\nEventually, the deal went through after East West pledged to commit a certain\namount of money to community redevelopment. Once the merger happened, Desert\nCommunity Bank\u2019s president quit and left the state, saying he could \u201cno longer\nface the many people in the community who feel I stabbed them in the back and\nsold out.\u201d\n\nNg dismissed the radio comments as simple prejudice, but it\u2019s clear the\ncriticism from Greenlining still stings.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought they would have done more research,\u201d he said. \u201cNo bank\nin L.A. as a percentage has done more community redevelopment programs than we\ndo.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, the Victorville acquisition itself ended up being a costly one\ndue to its heavy real estate exposure, contributing to the bank\u2019s 2008 financial\ntroubles.\n\n\u201cIt went awfully,\u201d said Julianna Balicka, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods\u2019\nSan Francisco office. \u201cIt was one of the biggest drivers of their real estate\nproblems.\u201d\n\nExit strategy\n\nSo, at 53, Ng has taken his lumps, and has handled the worst of the financial\ncrisis and more than survived. Though he\u2019s still young for a financial\nexecutive, finding someone to succeed him as chief executive has been on his\nmind since 2005.\n\n\u201cAfter spending about 14 years at the bank I felt that maybe it was the right\ntime,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have the same person run the bank for all\nthese years.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, he has said that his job hasn\u2019t left much time for his family. He\nlives in Pasadena with his wife, Ellen, whom he met in college, and two teenage\nchildren.\n\n\u201cUsually on the weekends when I\u2019m in town and I\u2019m not traveling, I\u2019m home\nspending time with my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of time.\u201d\n\nHis 16-year-old daughter is an accomplished equestrian, having competed last\nyear in the World Championships for Icelandic Horseriding in Europe. He rides\nhorses with her and drives her on weekends to Santa Ynez for training. He plays\ngolf with his son.\n\nRich Thomas, who\u2019s known Ng since he first moved out to Los Angeles, said he\nbelieves that Ng regrets the time he\u2019s lost with his family.\n\n\u201cHis children are teenagers and these kind of continue to be formative years for\nadulthood,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHe spends a lot of time at work and I think he looks\nat it and says, \u2018I wish I had been able to spend more time with my children.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast year, with the economy improving, Ng started looking at succession planning\nagain. The idea is for him to move into a nonexecutive chairman position. With\nthe exponentially growing importance of China as a trade and investment partner\nwith the United States, Ng wants to ensure that the bank remains true to its\nrole as a conduit between the two countries \u2013 and not just financially.\n\nIn 2007, East West entered into a partnership in which it bought $2 million in\nChinese art, but made it available for exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary\nArt in downtown Los Angeles. East West is also sponsoring a solo exhibition of\nChinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang scheduled to open at MOCA in April.\n\n\u201cI see East West as a long-term, sustainable, meaningful organization,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBecause of that I really don\u2019t want to see it end because I have to end.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s certainly in a comfortable position financially. He is East West\u2019s biggest\nindividual shareholder, with stock worth $13 million. His compensation in 2010\nwas $5 million, most of that in stock. So what might his life look like after\nstepping back?\n\nSome have floated the idea of Ng getting involved in politics.\n\n\u201cI hope he runs for political office,\u201d Nazarian said. \u201cI think having the\nvisibility of running a bank the size of East West gives a real good level of\ncontrolled visibility and skill sets.\u201d\n\nBut Ng dismissed that possibility. He has been active in philanthropy and other\ncivic causes, often with an emphasis on U.S.-China relations, and said he is\nlikely to continue after his banking career is over.\n\nHe speaks with pride about his tenure as the first Asian-American campaign chair\nof the United Way of Greater Los Angeles. He\u2019s currently the chair of the\nCommittee of 100, a group dedicated to U.S.-China relations and other\nChinese-American issues. In that capacity, he co-hosted a welcome luncheon in\nLos Angeles in February for Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, slated to be the\nnext leader of China.\n\nHe also meets about once a month with a private club of about 30\nChinese-American businessmen, said Red Chamber\u2019s Kou.\n\nNg said if he determined that he\u2019s no longer needed at the bank, he would likely\ncontinue along those lines.\n\n\u201cI am 100 percent sure there are plenty of opportunities for me to get involved,\nboth in civic involvement or helping the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nlike the idea of whatever civic and philanthropic duties, I would try to also\nplay the bridge between the East and the West.\u201d",

        "content": "GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT\n\nThe Global Financial Stability Report provides an assessment of the global\nfinancial system and markets, and addresses emerging market financing in a\nglobal context. It focuses on current market conditions, highlighting systemic\nissues that could pose a risk to financial stability and sustained market access\nby emerging market borrowers. The Report draws out the financial ramifications\nof economic imbalances highlighted by the IMF's World Economic Outlook. It\ncontains, as special features, analytical chapters or essays on structural or\nsystemic issues relevant to international financial stability.\n\nPage: 1 of 5 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n2024\n\nTHE LAST MILE: FINANCIAL VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nDescription: Chapter 1 highlight the near-term global financial stability risks\nhave receded amid expectations that global disinflation is entering its last\nmile. However, along it, there are several salient risks and a build-up of\nmedium-term vulnerabilities. Chapter 2 assesses vulnerabilities and potential\nrisks to financial stability in corporate private credit, a rapidly growing\nasset class\u2014traditionally focused on providing loans to midsize firms outside\nthe realms of either commercial banks or public debt markets\u2014that now rivals\nother major credit markets in size. Chapter 3 shows that while cyber incidents\nhave thus far not been systemic, the probability of severe cyber incidents has\nincreased, posing an acute threat to macrofinancial stability.\n\n\n2023\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT, OCTOBER 2023: FINANCIAL AND CLIMATE POLICIES\nFOR A HIGH-INTEREST-RATE ERA\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nFinancial and Climate Policies for a High-Interest-Rate Era\n\nChapter 1 assesses that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside,\nsimilar to the assessment in the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report.\nCracks in the financial system may turn into worrisome fault lines should a soft\nlanding of the global economy hoped for by market participants does not\nmaterialize. Chapter 2 homes in on the global banking system, providing a fresh\nassessment of vulnerabilities in a higher-for-longer environment, using an\nenhanced global stress test and a set of newly developed market-based\nindicators. In response to the vulnerabilities that are uncovered, enhancements\nto supervisory practices and tightening of regulatory standards are proposed.\nChapter 3 notes that a broad mix of policies is required to unlock the private\ncapital necessary to cover climate mitigation investment needs in emerging\nmarket and developing economies.\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT, APRIL 2023: SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL STABILITY\nAMID HIGH INFLATION AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS\n\nApril 11, 2023\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nSafeguarding Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Geopolitical Risks\n\nChapter 1 analyzes the recent turmoil in the banking sector and the challenges\nposed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and\nthe buildup in vulnerabilities since the global financial crisis. The emergence\nof stress in financial markets complicates the task of central banks at a time\nwhen inflationary pressures are proving to be more persistent than anticipated.\nSmaller and riskier emerging markets continue to confront worsening debt\nsustainability trends. Chapter 2 examines nonbank financial intermediaries\n(NBFIs) and the vulnerabilities that can emerge from elevated leverage,\nliquidity mismatches, and high levels of interconnectedness. Tools to tackle the\nfinancial stability consequences of NBFI stress are proposed, underscoring that\ndirect access to central bank liquidity could prove necessary in times of\nstress, but implementing appropriate guardrails is paramount. Chapter 3 analyzes\nthe effect of geopolitical tensions on financial fragmentation and explores\ntheir implications for financial stability\u2014including through potential capital\nflow reversals, disruptions of cross-border payments, impact on banks\u2019 funding\ncosts, profitability, and credit provision, and more limited opportunities for\ninternational risk diversification. Based on the findings, it draws policy\nrecommendations aimed at strengthening financial oversight, building larger\nbuffers, and enhancing international cooperation.\n\n\n2022\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT, OCTOBER 2022: NAVIGATING THE HIGH-INFLATION\nENVIRONMENT\n\nOctober 11, 2022\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nNavigating the High-Inflation Environment\n\nChapter 1 analyzes the policy response of central banks to high inflation, the\nrisks of a disorderly tightening of financial conditions, and debt distress\namong emerging and frontier markets. Markets have been extremely volatile, and a\ndeterioration in market liquidity appears to have amplified price moves. In\nEurope, the energy crisis is contributing to a worsening outlook. In China, the\nproperty sector remains a key source of vulnerability. Chapter 2 examines how to\nnarrow the climate financing gap in emerging market and developing economies.\nClimate policies, including carbon pricing, climate disclosures, and transition\ntaxonomies, are crucial for enabling private climate finance. Innovative\nfinancial instruments can help to scale up private climate finance, but the\npublic sector\u2014including multilateral development banks\u2014will have to play a key\nsupporting role. Chapter 3 analyzes the contributions of open-end investment\nfunds to fragilities in asset markets. Open-end investment funds play a key role\nin financial markets, but those offering daily redemptions while holding\nilliquid assets can amplify the effects of adverse shocks by raising the\nlikelihood of investor runs and asset fire sales. This contributes to volatility\nin asset markets and potentially threatens financial stability.\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT, APRIL 2022: SHOCKWAVES FROM THE WAR IN\nUKRAINE TEST THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\u2019S RESILIENCE\n\nApril 19, 2022\n\nDescription:\n\n\n\nShockwaves from the War in Ukraine Test the Financial System\u2019s Resilience\n\nChapter 1 looks at the implications of the war in Ukraine on the financial\nsystem. Commodity prices pose challenging trade-offs for central banks. Many\nemerging and frontier markets are facing especially difficult conditions. In\nChina, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated amid ongoing stress in the\nproperty sector and new COVID-19 outbreaks. Central banks should act decisively\nto prevent inflation from becoming entrenched without jeopardizing the recovery.\nPolicymakers will need to confront the structural issues brought to the fore by\nthe war, including the trade-off between energy security and climate transition.\nChapter 2 discusses the sovereign-bank nexus in emerging markets. Bank holdings\nof domestic sovereign bonds have surged in emerging markets during the pandemic.\nWith public debt at historically high levels and the sovereign credit outlook\ndeteriorating, there is a risk of a negative feedback loop that could threaten\nmacro-financial stability. Chapter 3 examines the challenges to financial\nstability posed by the rapid rise of risky business segments in fintech.\nPolicies that target both fintech firms and incumbent banks proportionately are\nneeded.\n\n\n2021\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT, OCTOBER 2021\n\nOctober 6, 2021\n\nDescription: Financial stability risks have been contained so far, reflecting\nongoing policy support and a rebound in the global economy earlier this year.\nChapter 1 explains that financial conditions have eased further in net in\nadvanced economies but changed little in emerging markets. However, the optimism\nthat propelled markets earlier in the year has faded on growing concerns about\nthe strength of the global recovery, and ongoing supply chain disruptions\nintensified inflation concerns. Signs of stretched asset valuations in some\nmarket segments persist, and pockets of vulnerabilities remain in the nonbank\nfinancial sector; recovery is uneven in the corporate sector. Chapter 2\ndiscusses the opportunities and challenges of the crypto ecosystem. Crypto asset\nproviders\u2019 lack of operational or cyber resilience poses risks, and significant\ndata gaps imperil financial integrity. Crypto assets in emerging markets may\naccelerate dollarization risks. Chapter 3 shows that sustainable funds can\nsupport the global transition to a green economy but must be scaled up to have a\nmajor impact. It also discusses how a disorderly transition could disrupt the\nbroader investment fund sector in the future.\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT, APRIL 2021: PREEMPTING A LEGACY OF\nVULNERABILITIES\n\nApril 6, 2021\n\nDescription:\n\nExtraordinary policy measures have eased financial conditions and supported the\neconomy, helping to contain financial stability risks. Chapter 1 warns that\nthere is a pressing need to act to avoid a legacy of vulnerabilities while\navoiding a broad tightening of financial conditions. Actions taken during the\npandemic may have unintended consequences such as stretched valuations and\nrising financial vulnerabilities. The recovery is also expected to be\nasynchronous and divergent between advanced and emerging market economies. Given\nlarge external financing needs, several emerging markets face challenges,\nespecially if a persistent rise in US rates brings about a repricing of risk and\ntighter financial conditions. The corporate sector in many countries is emerging\nfrom the pandemic overindebted, with notable differences depending on firm size\nand sector. Concerns about the credit quality of hard-hit borrowers and\nprofitability are likely to weigh on the risk appetite of banks. Chapter 2\nstudies leverage in the nonfinancial private sector before and during the\nCOVID-19 crisis, pointing out that policymakers face a trade-off between\nboosting growth in the short term by facilitating an easing of financial\nconditions and containing future downside risks. This trade-off may be amplified\nby the existing high and rapidly building leverage, increasing downside risks to\nfuture growth. The appropriate timing for deployment of macroprudential tools\nshould be country-specific, depending on the pace of recovery, vulnerabilities,\nand policy tools available. Chapter 3 turns to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis\non the commercial real estate sector. While there is little evidence of large\nprice misalignments at the onset of the pandemic, signs of overvaluation have\nnow emerged in some economies. Misalignments in commercial real estate prices,\nespecially if they interact with other vulnerabilities, increase downside risks\nto future growth due to the possibility of sharp price corrections.\n\n\n2020\n\nGLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT: BRIDGE TO RECOVERY\n\nOctober 13, 2020\n\nDescription: Near-term global financial stability risks have been contained as\nan unprecedented policy response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has\nhelped avert a financial meltdown and maintain the flow of credit to the\neconomy. For the first time, many emerging market central banks have launched\nasset purchase programs to support the smooth functioning of financial markets\nand the overall economy. But the outlook remains highly uncertain, and\nvulnerabilities are rising, representing potential headwinds to recovery. The\nreport presents an assessment of the real-financial disconnect, as well as\nforward-looking analysis of nonfinancial firms, banks, and emerging market\ncapital flows. After the outbreak, firms\u2019 cash flows were adversely affected as\neconomic activity declined sharply. More vulnerable firms\u2014those with weaker\nsolvency and liquidity positions and smaller size\u2014experienced greater financial\nstress than their peers in the early stages of the crisis. As the crisis\nunfolds, corporate liquidity pressures may morph into insolvencies, especially\nif the recovery is delayed. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more\nvulnerable than large firms with access to capital markets. Although the global\nbanking system is well capitalized, some banking systems may experience capital\nshortfalls in an adverse scenario, even with the currently deployed policy\nmeasures. The report also assesses the pandemic\u2019s impact on firms\u2019 environmental\nperformance to gauge the extent to which the crisis may result in a reversal of\nthe gains posted in recent years.\n\nPage: 1 of 5 1 2 3 4 5",

        "content": "At the normative level, there is negative correlation between an increase in the\nnominal anchor, popularly called Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and equity prices in\nthe stock market . When there is an increase in the MPR, speculators hit the\npanic button, dump their shares and move the money to the market to take\nadvantage of rising interest rate. This often pushes a stock market into bearish\ntrend. As a corollary, when the MPR decreases, speculators withdraw from the\nmoney market to take position in the capital market.\n\nAlthough an analyst can predict the market through fundamental analysis,\ntechnical analysis or random walk model, market occasionally takes its own\ncourse irrespective of an analyst\u2019s forecast. This played out on the Nigerian\nExchange Limited (NGX) in November 2022, when the Monetary Policy Committee\n(MPC) of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) raised the MPR to 16.5 percent as one of\nthe last options to tame the rising import inflation.\n\nBut contrary to the usual expectation that speculators shall take advantage of\nanticipated higher interest rate and pull out of the stock market, they defied\nthe new rate and continued to invest in equities of quoted companies with strong\nfundamentals. Under this atmosphere, NGX gained above 20 percent, a significant\nperformance by global standard against the background of tough operating\nenvironment. Top analysts attributed the market\u2019s stella performance to\nheartwarming corporate earnings and great expectation of a new government after\nthe upcoming Presidential Election.\n\nAt the moment, the permutation is that whoever emerges victorious among the\nthree top contenders will be pro-market and operate a private sector-led\neconomy. These and other issues cut across the manifesto of each of the three\nleading aspirants. As at the period of this writing, NGX is on bullish trend. By\nthe recent development, the market has signalled that a change in MPR does not\nautomatically translate to negative correlation in equity investment. There is\nnothing esoteric about the market performance. It has only confirmed the\nperception that the market is imbued with self-correction mechanism.\n\nThe Nigerian economy is tail spinning into bleak future everyday.

The projections may not be\nso realistic but they portend weak and slippery economic outlook for Nigeria\nthis year. The global rating agency, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, has downgraded\nNigeria\u2019s rating from B3 to junk bonds and also issued red flags to nine\nNigerian banks- Access Bank Plc, Zenith Bank, First Bank of Nigeria Limited,\nGuaranty Trust Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) and Sterling Bank.\n\nRead also:\u00a0Do we need another GDP rebasing?\n\nExternal reserve has declined by $ 64 million from $37.08bn to $37.01bn at the\nend of January 30, 2023.

It is a predictive method of purchase and\nsale of securities as a risk aversion method. Market timing is an integral part\nof active investment management. It is the opposite of buy-and -hold investment\nstrategy. Professionals that deploy market timing use tools like chart analysis,\ntrend analysis, economic forecasts and even gut feelings to determine the\noptimal time for transaction.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, market timing is good for investors that have short time\nhorizon. It can generate big profits, curtail losses and tame volatility. But\nsome stockbrokers, fund and portfolio managers who shy away from market timing\nwould argue that it is time-consuming and requires paying daily attention to the\nmarket. It is subject to higher transaction cost, tax-disadvantaged short time\ncapital gain and risk of determining the time to enter and exit the market.\n\nThe investor\u2019s risk tolerance and time horizon as revealed in his Investment\nPolicy can help to determine his appetite for market timing as an investment\nstrategy.

        "content": "Updated\n\nNov 20, 2023, 01:40 PM\n\nPublished\n\nNov 17, 2023, 05:11 PM\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 A healthy number of companies were listed across the region in 2023,\nbut the total amount raised is the lowest in eight years.\n\nThere have been 153 initial public offerings (IPOs) so far in 2023 on the\nregion\u2019s key stock exchanges \u2013 Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam\nand the Philippines \u2013 down from a total of 163 in 2022. No more listings are\nscheduled for 2023. The IPOs raised around US$5.5 billion (S$7.4 billion), well\nbelow the US$7.6 billion collected in 2022, noted a study by accounting giant\nDeloitte.\n\nIts analysis showed that Indonesia was the strongest regional performer, with 77\nIPOs raising US$3.6 billion (S$4.8 billion). This accounted for half of the\nregion\u2019s listings and 66 per cent of the total amount raised across the six\nbourses. It makes Indonesia the fourth-strongest stock exchange globally so far\nin 2023, behind only China, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe 2023 listings have seen a trend of firms affiliated with the electric\nvehicle market, including those in the mining and associated ancillary sectors,\nand renewable energy firms.\n\nDeloitte noted: \u201cAs countries strive to meet their climate objectives and\nestablish carbon-neutral economies, electric vehicle firms and renewable energy\ncompanies... alongside those providing environmental solutions, are being\nembraced.\u201d\n\nThe consumer industry remained among the top three sectors, as in the preceding\ntwo years, with a growing young middle class in the region armed with higher\nspending power.\n\nDeloitte said: \u201cSouth-east Asian companies are thriving and have the ability to\ngo beyond their shores for cross-border IPOs.\n\n\u201cThis is driven by expectations of favourable valuations, enhanced liquidity,\nindustry comparability and investor familiarity with certain sectors.\u201d\n\nIt added that exchanges across the world are implementing various initiatives in\na bid to attract some of the region\u2019s high-growth businesses.\n\nMs Tay Hwee Ling, Deloitte South-east Asia and Singapore disruptive events\nadvisory leader, said the challenge of sustaining a vibrant and attractive cash\nequities market is not unique to the region.\n\n\u201cGlobally, the number of IPOs and IPO proceeds raised have normalised to\npre-Covid-19 levels. This is driven by companies staying private for longer, and\nmore recently against the backdrop of a challenging global macroeconomic and\ninterest rate environment,\u201d she said.\n\nThere have been five IPOs on Singapore\u2019s Catalist board so far in 2023, raising\nUS$29 million.\n\nDeloitte noted that Singapore typically has some sizeable mainboard IPOs,\nincluding real estate investment trusts (Reits) and special purpose acquisition\ncompanies, to bolster its overall performance, but these have not materialised\nin 2023.\n\nMs Tay said there has been a hiatus of Reit and business trust listings on the\nSingapore Exchange since 2021, against the backdrop of high interest rates. \u201cThe\nhigh Fed rates also encourage investors to take advantage of high rates of\nreturn, resulting in capital flight to the United States. As a result, there has\nbeen a steady stream of Singapore companies successfully listing in the US in\nrecent years,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms Tay added that Singapore companies also have various fund-raising\nopportunities here, and are able to hold off tapping equity capital markets\nuntil the right window opens for an IPO.\n\nDeloitte Singapore disruptive events advisory deputy leader Darren Ng also\nnoted: \u201cWhile the Singapore IPO market may appear subdued this year, it is\nimportant to note the wealth of high-calibre Singaporean companies ready to\nexplore cross-border listings on global exchanges.\n\n\u201cThey are also enjoying international recognition for their robust business\nfundamentals.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there has been a trend of South-east Asian firms looking to list on\nlarge overseas markets instead in the hopes that those bourses can enable their\nbusiness growth or expansion in that region, Ms Tay said.\n\n\u201cIt is a positive sign that South-east Asian companies are getting attention\nfrom other exchanges,\u201d she added. Countries in the region are tipped to enjoy\npositive economic growth in 2024, she noted. \u201cIn addition, there are signs that\ninflation rates have levelled out and talks about rate cuts are on the\nhorizon... With the right valuation and timing, there remains a sea of\nopportunities for the IPO capital market in 2024.\u201d",

This means assessing the research\nperformance of\u00a0tertiary education organisations (TEOs)\u00a0and then funding them on\nthe basis of their performance.\n\nTe P\u016bkenga, private training establishments (PTEs), universities and w\u0101nanga\u00a0can\nchoose to participate.\n\nThe PBRF is an on-Plan\u00a0fund.\n\n\nPURPOSE\n\nThe Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is designed to increase the quality\nof research by encouraging and rewarding excellent research in Aotearoa New\nZealand\u2019s degree-granting organisations. It does not fund specific research\nprojects directly, but provides bulk funding to support an organisation\u2019s\nresearch capability, including postgraduate-level teaching support.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThe primary objectives of the PBRF are to:\n\n * increase the quality of basic and applied research at\u00a0Aotearoa\u00a0New Zealand's\n   degree-granting TEOs;\n * support world-leading, research-led teaching and learning at degree and\n   postgraduate levels;\n * assist\u00a0Aotearoa\u00a0New Zealand's TEOs to maintain and lift their competitive\n   rankings relative to their international peers;\n * provide robust public information to stakeholders about research performance\n   within and across TEOs;\u00a0and\n * support a robust and inclusive system for developing and sustaining research\n   excellence in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nIn doing so, the PBRF will also:\n\n * support the development of postgraduate student researchers and new and\n   emerging researchers;\n * support research activities that provide economic, social, cultural, and\n   environmental benefits to Aotearoa New Zealand, including the advancement of\n   M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori; and\u00a0\n * support technology and knowledge transfer to\u00a0Aotearoa\u00a0New Zealand businesses,\n   iwi and communities.\n\n\nREWARDING EXCELLENCE\n\nTo meet these objectives, the main focus of the PBRF is on rewarding and\nencouraging excellence.\n\nFor the purposes of the Quality Evaluation, research excellence will be assessed\nin terms of originality, rigour, reach, and significance, with reference to the\nquality standards appropriate to the subject area and to the unique nature of\nAotearoa New Zealand\u2019s research cultures and needs.\n\nExcellence will be assessed across the following areas of activity:\n\n * The production and creation of knowledge, including ontologies,\n   epistemologies, and methodologies unique to M\u0101ori and to Pacific communities;\n * The dissemination and application of that knowledge within academic and/or\n   other communities and its impact outside the research environment; and\n * Activity which sustains and develops the research environment, within and\n   across both academic and non-academic domains.\u00a0\n\n\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe PBRF is governed by the following principles:\n\n * Partnership: the PBRF should reflect the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New\n   Zealand and the special role and status of the Treaty of Waitangi / Te Tiriti\n   o Waitangi.\n * Equity: different approaches and resources are needed to ensure that the\n   measurement of research excellence leads to equitable outcomes.\n * Inclusiveness: the PBRF should encourage and recognise the full diversity of\n   epistemologies, knowledges and methodologies to reflect Aotearoa New\n   Zealand\u2019s people.\n * Comprehensiveness: the PBRF should appropriately measure the quality of the\n   full range of original investigative activity that occurs within the sector,\n   regardless of its type, form, or place of output.\u00a0\n * Respect for academic traditions: the PBRF should operate in a manner that is\n   consistent with academic freedom and institutional autonomy.\u00a0\n * Consistency: evaluations of quality made through the PBRF should be\n   consistent across the different subject areas and in the calibration of\n   quality ratings against international standards of excellence.\u00a0\n * Continuity: changes to the PBRF process should only be made where they can\n   bring demonstrable improvements that outweigh the cost of implementing them.\u00a0\n * Differentiation: the PBRF should allow stakeholders and the Government to\n   differentiate between providers and their units on the basis of their\n   relative quality.\u00a0\n * Credibility: the methodology, format and processes employed in the PBRF must\n   be credible to those being assessed.\u00a0\n * Efficiency: administrative and compliance costs should be kept to the\n   minimum, consistent with a robust and credible process.\u00a0\n * Transparency: decisions and decision-making processes must be explained\n   openly, except where there is a need to preserve confidentiality and\n   privacy.\u00a0\n * Complementarity: the PBRF should be integrated with new and existing\n   policies, such as Investment Plans, and quality assurance systems for degrees\n   and degree providers.\n\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE PBRF\n\nIn November 2001, the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission recommended the\nintroduction of a performance-based research fund for tertiary education\norganisations (TEOs).\u00a0\n\nThe Performance-based Research Fund (PBRF) Working Group was established in July\n2002. It advised government on the detailed design and implementation of a\nperformance-based system for funding research in New Zealand\u2019s degree-granting\norganisations.\n\nCabinet endorsed the PBRF Working Group\u2019s recommendations in December 2002.\nThese recommendations, which are the basis of the PBRF, are in the report\nInvesting in Excellence (PDF 604 KB).\n\nThe origins of PBRF funding are in the funding provided to tertiary education\norganisations for teaching, specifically the portion they received as a \u201ctop-up\u201d\nfor teaching research degrees.\u00a0These funds were not intended to fund research,\nbut to enable tertiary education providers to provide research-based teaching.\nWhile the Government has invested additional money over time, most of the fund\ncomes from these top-ups.\u00a0\n\n\nHOW THE FUND WORKS\n\nThe PBRF comprises three funding components:\n\n * The Quality Evaluation\n * Research Degree Completions, and\n * External Research Income.\n\nPBRF funding is paid through the\u00a0Investment Plan. Delivery of the Plan is\nmonitored by the\u00a0TEC.\n\nThe Quality Evaluation is an assessment of the research performance of staff at\neligible TEOs, including universities, Te P\u016bkenga, w\u0101nanga and private training\nestablishments (PTEs).\u00a0TEOs present their staff members\u2019 research in Evidence\nPortfolios, which are assessed for quality by expert peer review panels.\u00a0\n\nThis component\u00a0is\u00a0used\u00a0to allocate\u00a055 percent of the PBRF funding pool,\ndetermined by the Government through its annual Budget.\n\nThe Quality Evaluation is held periodically.\u00a0The next Quality Evaluation was due\nto be held in 2026. However, the Minister for Tertiary Education and Skills has\ndecided that Quality Evaluation 2026 will not go ahead.\n\nA University Advisory Group (UAG) has been established by the Government to\ncarry out an independent review of the university system including the PBRF.\n\nThere have been four previous Quality Evaluation rounds, in 2003, 2006, 2012 and\n2018. For more information about these earlier rounds see\u00a0Previous Quality\nEvaluation Rounds.\n\nThe Research Degree Completions\u00a0component\u00a0is a yearly measurement of the number\nof PBRF-eligible postgraduate research-based degrees completed at participating\nTEOs.\n\nThis component\u00a0is used to allocate\u00a025 percent of the fund.\n\nFor information on how RDC funding is calculated, see Detailed fund information\n\u2013 PBRF.\n\nThe External Research Income\u00a0(ERI) component\u00a0is a yearly measurement of the\namount and type of income participating TEOs receive\u00a0for research purposes\u00a0from\nexternal sources.\n\nThis component\u00a0is\u00a0used to allocate\u00a020 percent of the fund.\n\nFor information on how ERI funding is calculated, see Detailed fund information\n\u2013 PBRF.\n\nERI WEIGHTING\n\nFollowing the 2019\u201320 review of the PBRF,\u00a0the\u00a0Government amended the weightings\napplied to the different types of ERI.\n\nFrom 1 January\u00a02022 ERI income is weighted by income source as follows.\u00a0\n\nSource of external research income\n\nWeighting\n\nAotearoa New Zealand government contestable funds\n\n1\n\nAotearoa New Zealand public sector contract research\n\n1\n\nNon-government income from within Aotearoa New Zealand\n\n4\n\nOverseas research income\n\n3.5\n\nThe new weightings on ERI\u00a0income source\u00a0apply to the 2022 ERI\u00a0data\u00a0that\nis\u00a0reported in 2023 and\u00a0will inform the calculation of TEOs\u2019 PBRF funding\nallocations from the 2024 funding year onwards. By 2026, all of the ERI\ncomponent will be allocated based on ERI weighted by source.\n\nAny ERI data reported by TEOs for years prior to 2022 will continue to be\nweighted at the rates set out in the 2014 Funding Determination, as set out in\nthe table below.\n\n\u00a0Source of external research income\n\nWeighting\n\nAotearoa New Zealand government contestable funds\n\n1\n\nAotearoa New Zealand public sector contract research\n\n1\n\nNon-government income from within Aotearoa New Zealand\n\n2\n\nOverseas research income\n\n1.5\n\nAllocation of funding for ERI is based on each TEO\u2019s proportion of the total ERI\nearned by all participating TEOs, weighted by funding source.\u00a0\n\nFor guidance on completing ERI returns, see the\u00a0PBRF User Manual v5 (PDF 907\nKB).\n\n\nREVIEW OF THE PBRF, 2019\u20132020\n\nCabinet announced changes to the PBRF in July 2021, after a review of the PBRF\nin 2019\u20132020.\n\nThe review examined how to support research excellence by improving the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the PBRF. It aimed to ensure the benefits of\nresearch are shared across\u00a0Aotearoa\u00a0New Zealand.\n\nFor more information on the review, including the panel\u2019s final report and\nCabinet\u2019s decisions on changes to the PBRF, see\u00a0Performance-Based Research Fund\n\u2013 Ministry of Education.",

We also have to thank the new coach\n[Wong Tat Meng] who has given much advice to Ng.\n\n\u201cNg did a very good job with his neat defence, allowing the opponent little\nchance in attack.

        "content": "Present Participle, Babel, Burrow, and more. Remember these words, because they\njust might be the title of an exhibition of artworks at a gallery near you one\nday. But even more memorable are undoubtedly the illustrations themselves. And\nthe mind and hand behind them belong to unassuming Chen Yiming.\n\nThe 19-year-old is a med student at the National University of Singapore (NUS)\nand a part-time artist (he prefers \"hobbyist\"), and has chalked up more than a\n100k followers on Instagram, thanks to his engaging drawing-related content.\nHe's even had juniors from school crediting his style as inspo for their final\nproject.\n\nThe works are decidedly mesmerising: One's imagination runs wild just\nscrutinising the towering skyscrapers, dystopian-looking environments, complex\narchitectural structures, and microscopic details galore.\n\nThe stark black-and-white contrast, the focus on buildings, and foreboding\nimagery all conspire to stir discussions about topics like \"inequality\",\n\"class\", and \"climate\".\n\n\n\n\"The easiest way to get people to think about something is to disturb them, hit\nthem in a way that they don't it see coming. When we're comfortable, we don't\nreally like to think outside the box,\" says Yiming.\n\n\"So I want to draw communities in a way that makes people go like, 'Oh, damn\nthat's a bit sad', and then they start to think, 'Oh, that's interesting, maybe\nthis is our future' and stuff like that. That's the way I like to communicate -\nit makes people have a more genuine and deeper reaction to [the artwork].\"\n\n\n\nIt's clear that Yiming has reflected deeply about the ideas behind his works,\ndetailing his thoughts on them. He shares that the process differs for each\npiece.\n\n\"I'll try to find a complement. So if I have a meaning that I want to express,\nthen I'll find a way to do it aesthetically. And if I have an aesthetic that I\nwant to hit, then I'll find some way I can make that meaningful,\" he says.\n\nWe speak to Yiming about his first encounter with art,\u00a0the confluence of the\nworlds of art and medicine, and the pressures of going viral.\n\n\nDO YOU REMEMBER YOUR VERY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH ART?\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/reel/CldcrGLubyT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmgjMuSPakv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]\n\nMy parents are engineers. Before computerisation, there was a lot of drafting\npaper around because they would do a lot of drafting. And as a kid, you're just\nnaturally curious. So I picked up pens and just started doodling with them.\n\nI also liked watching \"Cars\" a lot. It was my favorite animated movie. So I drew\na lot of Cars, to the point where there were entire files of just Cars drawings.\n\nThen, it was Minecraft, and then there was a lot of Lego. I was a huge Lego fan\nback then - maybe it shows\u00a0in my love for buildings!\n\n\nHOW DID YOU DEVELOP YOUR STYLE?\n\nI tried out this style at the very beginning in Sec 2 because there was this\nartist I really liked online - Sam Gillett. He does a lot of building drawings.\u00a0\n\nI was like, \"Ooh, that's quite cool. I should try this.\" I remember the very\nfirst thing I drew was this cabin and a bunch of trees. And then slowly, slowly,\nit just developed into this.\u00a0He followed me back [on Instagram] very recently.\nSuper fanboy moment!\n\n\nJUST CURIOUS: HOW COME YOU PICKED MEDICINE OVER, SAY, ARCHITECTURE?\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmgyU-4h29C/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClRLgVRJTu-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]\n\nOh, actually, funny story. My parents didn't want me to do medicine. I was very\nshocked because you hear all the time that that's what every Asian parent wants\ntheir kids to do - learn guitar, play tennis, play basketball and pursue\nmedicine!\n\nIn Sec 4 and JC1, I was quite lost as to what I wanted to do. There were a few\ncareer paths that I considered: mainly, to teach, to do architecture, and also\nbe a doctor. And among these three, medicine gave me the biggest challenge\nbecause I was quite a science student last time.\n\nI was never really very good at talking or being interpersonal. So I thought,\nyou know what, being a doctor kind of forces you to apply that science in a way\nwhere you have to talk to different people and hold a lot of sometimes very\ndifficult conversations. And being a doctor was something that I could\nconstantly see being meaningful in some way, and being very constructive to\nother people's lives.\n\nThe impact for something like architecture or teaching is a bit more indirect or\ndelayed.

I didn't expect to love it that much. I wanted\nto make a very grim image. I think I was feeling a bit edgy at that point\nbecause it started with, I wanna do something about climate again. I don't know\nwhy, but I just keep going back to climate-related works.\n\nAnd I think a lot of climate stuff was happening in the news also. It began as a\nvery black piece also, because a bunch of my previous works are bright like\n\"Babel\". I didn't really use the blacks a lot, so I was like, okay, this is a\ngood learning opportunity.\n\nI wanted to express the meaning that right now humanity is stuck in this\ndownward spiral of fossil fuels. And now, arguably, maybe we can still get out\nof it. But I wanted to depict a world where there is literally no way that we\ncan get out of it.\n\nAnd then I thought about how I was gonna express it aesthetically.

        "content": "National Grid\u2019s full-year revenue fell 8% to \u00a319.9bn. Underlying operating\nprofits rose 6% to \u00a34.8bn, ignoring the impact of exchange rates. This was\nlargely driven by higher allowed revenues in the UK Transmission business and\nhigher rates in the US.\n\nFree cash flow fell from \u00a3105mn to \u00a387mn. Net debt increased from \u00a341.0bn to\n43.6bn.\n\nNational Grid plans to invest around \u00a360bn in upgrading its energy\ninfrastructure over the five years ending March 2029. To fund this, a rights\nissue has been announced where investors can buy 7 new shares for every 24 they\nalready own, at a discount of roughly a third. Issuing these new equity shares\nis expected to raise around \u00a36.8bn of cash.\n\nA final dividend of 39.12p per share was announced, taking the full-year total\nto 58.52p, up 6%.\n\nThe shares fell 7.4% following the announcement.\n\n\nOUR VIEW\n\nNational Grid\u2019s full-year results saw it announce a mammoth investment plan\nalongside a \u00a36.8bn equity raise. This raise is bigger and sooner than markets\nwere expecting, which combined with rebasing the 2024 dividend at a lower level,\ncaused the valuation to take a tumble on the day.\n\nWith the energy landscape changing fast, the group\u2019s attempting to plant itself\nat the centre of the electric revolution. Investment in energy infrastructure is\nset to rise significantly to around \u00a360bn over the five years ending March 2029,\nnearly double the investment over the past five years.\n\nAlongside this, the portfolio is being streamlined, with a couple of assets that\ndon\u2019t fit the new strategy set to be sold off. This will free up extra cash to\nplough back into other areas of the business while also allowing management to\nfocus on building out its energy infrastructure.\n\nThe dividend is also being rebased lower to help fund these growth plans and\nshore up the balance sheet. We have no concerns about balance sheet health, but\nthis all points towards more of a focus on long-term growth rather than\nshort-term returns, which we\u2019re supportive of.\n\nIn return for investing those billions to maintain and upgrade its\ninfrastructure, regulators allow National Grid to earn a reasonable profit, with\nthe potential to earn more if it exceeds targets. That translates into\npredictable revenues, low borrowing costs, and relatively resilient growth.\n\nThe regulatory environment can be a double-edged sword, though, as regulators\nhave the final say over National Grid's profit potential. The ongoing\ncost-of-living pressures and the recent surge in energy costs mean consumers are\nalready struggling to pay their bills. That's put a lot of pressure on\nregulators to start slicing into utilities' profits which could potentially put\nbrakes on future growth. Remember, because of regulation, National Grid's future\nisn't entirely under its own control.\n\nGiven the group's significant investment in this current high-rate environment,\nwe've been keeping a close eye on the cost of funding it all. Finance costs were\nbroadly flat year-on-year, and current high levels of inflation are actually a\nnet benefit for National Grid, and should more than offset the negative impact\nof higher interest rates.\n\nWe commend National Grid\u2019s willingness to pounce on shifting energy trends. The\nsheer scale of the investment plans brings with it increased execution risk, but\nshould management pull it off, investors will likely be rewarded for their\npatience. As always though, nothing is guaranteed and there\u2019s likely to be some\nvolatility along the way as the group executes its strategy.\n\n\nNATIONAL GRID KEY FACTS\n\nAll ratios are sourced from Refinitiv, based on previous day\u2019s closing values.\nPlease remember yields are variable and not a reliable indicator of future\nincome.

        "content": "More than half a million retail investors have a decision to make in the coming\ndays after National Grid (LSE:NG.) last week unveiled the UK\u2019s biggest rights\nissue since 2009.\n\nThe \u00a36.8 billion fundraising by the FTSE 100-listed energy infrastructure firm\ninvolves the offer of seven new shares at a discounted price of 645p for every\n24 already held.\n\n * Invest with ii:\u00a0Top UK Shares\u00a0|\u00a0Share Tips & Ideas\u00a0| Open a Managed ISA\n\nExisting shareholders have four choices: subscribe for the new shares, sell some\nand buy the rest using the proceeds, sell all the rights, or do nothing and let\nthe rights lapse.\n\nThe latest official time for acceptance is 11am on Monday 10 June, with dealings\nin the new shares set to begin at 8am on Wednesday 12 June. However, interactive\ninvestor clients must make their election by 5 June 2024, which is also the last\ntime they will be able to sell the nil-paid rights \u2014 the difference in value\nbetween the issue price (645p) and ex-rights price, adjusted for the final\ndividend of 39.12p per share.\n\nThe London market\u2019s last high-profile rights issue took place in October 2020,\nwhen troubled Rolls-Royce Holdings (LSE:RR.) raised \u00a32 billion by offering\n140,000 shareholders 10 new shares for every three already owned. The offer\nprice of 32p a share compares with 450p earlier today.\n\nNational Grid\u2019s fundraising is the biggest cash call since the\u00a0Lloyds Banking\nGroup (LSE:LLOY) rescue rights issue of 2009, when proceeds amounted to \u00a313.5\nbillion and new shares were issued at 37p.\n\nA year later in 2010, National Grid raised \u00a33.2 billion in preparation for an\nera of significantly higher capital investment worth \u00a322 billion over five\nyears. The two-for-five rights issue at 335p was the largest amount of equity\never raised by a UK utility.\n\n * ii view: National Grid rights issue to fund investment plans\n * eyeQ: National Grid \u2013 macro vs micro\n\nOver the past decade up to this March, National Grid has delivered a total\nshareholder return of 211% versus the FTSE 100 index at 172%.\n\nThe company is tapping shareholders again in 2024 as part of its pledge to\ndeliver \u00a360 billion of investment in energy network infrastructure in the UK and\nUS between 2024 and 2029. That\u2019s nearly double the amount of the previous\nfive-year period.\n\nNational Grid shares have fallen sharply since last Thursday\u2019s surprise\nresults-day announcement, a decline partly driven by technical forces as\nearnings per share forecasts have been impacted by the issue of so many new\nshares.\n\nHowever, Bank of America believes the market reaction gives no credit for the\nsubstantial de-risking of the company\u2019s balance sheet and the enhanced earnings\nvisibility through to 2029. It lowered its price target on Friday, but still\nsees a big upside to 1,170p.\n\n\n\nSource: TradingView.\u00a0Past performance is not a guide to future performance.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THE RIGHTS ISSUE?\n\nTo generate anticipated proceeds of \u00a36.8 billion, the company is issuing 1.085\nbillion new shares. This is equivalent to about 29.2% of its current share\ncapital, or 22.6% of the enlarged issued share capital of 4.807 billion once the\nfundraising is completed.\n\nThe issue price of 645p represents a 34.7% discount to the theoretical ex-rights\nprice, the level that factors in the impact of the new shares. This calculation\nis based on Wednesday evening\u2019s close of 1,127.5p (adjusted for 2024\u2019s dividend\nof 39.12p). National Grid shares will trade without the right to the dividend\nfrom 6 June and the dividend will be paid on 19 July.\n\n * Sign up to our free newsletter for share, fund and trust ideas, and the\n   latest news and analysis\n * 10 hottest ISA shares, funds and trusts: week ended 24 May 2024\n\nSeven new shares are being offered for every 24 held. These rights have a value\nand can be bought and sold. Shareholders can take up their rights until 10 June,\nwith any outstanding rights taken up by National Grid\u2019s banking partners.\n\nThe company had 639,029 shareholders at the end of March, with more than 500,000\nhaving fewer than 500 shares. In many cases their ownership dates back to the\nLondon stock market IPO on 11 December 1995. It\u2019s also been a popular stock with\nincome investors, given that the dividend (current yield 6.2%) is protected in\nreal terms through benchmarking against the increase in average annual CPI\ninflation plus housing costs (CPIH).\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE FOUR CHOICES FOR EXISTING NATIONAL GRID INVESTORS?\n\nSubscribe for the new shares, or exercise your rights, which means you have to\ninvest more money in the company. If you have 240 existing shares, for example,\nyou have the right to buy 70 new shares at 645p. By buying all your rights for a\ntotal price of \u00a3451.50, you now have 310 shares and own the same percentage of\nthe company as you did before the rights issue.\n\nYou can choose to sell some of the shares so you can buy the rest with the\nproceeds. The number of shares you are able to buy will depend on what price\npeople are willing to pay for the rights you are selling. But you will end up\nowning a smaller percentage of the total shares than you did before the rights\nissue.\n\n * Stockwatch: is stubborn inflation reason to worry?\n * Stock markets at records and cash at 5%: what will happen next?\n\nThe third option is to sell all the rights. Again, the price achieved will\ndepend on the price that people are willing to pay for those rights. Using the\nsame example as above, you will have 70 rights shares to sell and still own 240\nNational Grid shares, but this will be a smaller percentage of the company than\nbefore.\u00a0\n\nDo nothing and let your rights lapse. By doing so you will be diluting your\nstake in the company, including your entitlement to future dividend payments. If\nyou do this, your rights will be offered for sale to other investors and you\nwill be sent any proceeds by the company\u2019s share registrar (minus expenses).\n\n\n\n\nWHY THE FUNDRAISING?\n\nNational Grid is planning a significant increase in capital investment to around\n\u00a360 billion over the five-year period to 2029. Its financing plan has been\ndesigned to enable the company to retain a resilient balance sheet and\ninvestment grade credit rating, whilst still enabling a material step-up in\ninvestment in the coming years.\n\nAbout 52% of this expected spend will be in the UK, with the rest in the US.\nAround 85%, or \u00a351 billion, is \u201cgreen investment\u201d and 98% of the total in\nregulated businesses, including around 80% in electricity networks and\napproximately 10% offshore.\n\nThe investment comes as the UK government targets a fully decarbonised\nelectricity system by 2035, with a legal obligation under the Climate Change Act\n2008 to achieve net zero by 2050.\n\n * AIM stocks, elections and what to expect after 4 July\n * Stockwatch: a buy after strongest numbers this results season?\n\nNational Grid owns and operates the regulated high-voltage electricity\ntransmission network in England and Wales as well as the UK\u2019s largest regulated\nelectricity distribution business, which serves nearly eight million customers\nin the East and West Midlands, South West and Wales.\n\nA legally separate business balances the supply and demand of electricity to\nhomes and businesses in Britain.\u00a0\n\nUnlike the UK, the company\u2019s gas and electricity businesses in the US supply\nenergy directly to customers in New York and Massachusetts.\u00a0\n\nIn the US, the state of New York is targeting a 100% zero-emission electricity\nsector by 2040, while Massachusetts has set out a net-zero target by 2050.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE COMPANY SAY?\n\nNational Grid describes the rights issue as a pre-emptive opportunity for\nshareholders to fund and to benefit from its higher-growth strategy.\n\nIt believes it is in a position to deliver an \u201cattractive mix\u201d of asset and\nearnings growth and dividend yield, whilst enabling the energy transition in UK\nand US markets.\n\nIt says: \u201cThis builds on our track record of having delivered an over 30% higher\ntotal shareholder return compared with the FTSE 100 over the last decade.\u201d\n\n * Insider: heavy buying and selling of these FTSE 100 shares\n * Shares for the future: a business I love is in great shape\n\nIt has pledged to maintain a progressive total level of dividend, growing from\ncurrent levels of approximately \u00a32.17 billion for the year to March 2024.\n\nThe total dividend will be rebased by about 15% in order to take account of the\nnew shares in issue, with the company then sticking to its policy of growing the\npayout in line with UK CPIH.\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE CITY VIEW?\n\nShares have fallen sharply since the announcement, including Thursday\u2019s 11%\ndecline and a further 4% fall on Friday. This partly reflects the dilutive\nimpact of the new shares due to be issued, as well as the planned rebasing of\nthe dividend.\n\nBank of America also noted potential disappointment that the increased capital\nexpenditure has not meant an improved growth target for earnings per share (EPS)\ncompared with the previous business plan.\n\nIt adds that the timing of the announcement was also surprising, coming ahead of\nindustry regulator Ofgem\u2019s initial view on returns on its RIIO-T3 price control\nperiod for electricity transmission.\n\nNote: Ofgem\u2019s regulatory framework is known as RIIO (Revenue = Incentives +\nInnovation + Outputs). As National Grid explains: \u201cThe RIIO model offers network\ncompanies incentives for innovation and securing investment, so they can develop\nsustainable energy networks at the lowest cost for current and future\ncustomers.\u201d\n\n * How to invest ahead of the general election\n * Sector Screener: financially sound stocks with growth potential\n\nBank of America says: \u201cWe believe the market has given no credit for the\nsubstantial de-risking of the balance sheet and for enhanced earnings visibility\n(new outlook to 2029 vs prior outlook to 2026).\u201d\n\nIt also notes that the EPS growth targets are likely to have moderate upside due\nto further capital expenditure upgrades and potentially favourable regulatory\noutcomes.\n\nThe bank has reduced its EPS estimates over 2025-26 by 10-13% to reflect the\nhigher share count, with its new price target of 1,170p down 7.9% from 1,270p\npreviously.\n\nIt adds: \u201cWe note that the standalone dilution from the rights issue would have\nimplied a 9.8% reduction of equity value per share, which in our model is partly\noffset by slightly higher value creation in the UK and the US businesses (lower\ncost of capital) and lower financial expenses.\u201d\n\nThese articles are provided for information purposes only. \u00a0Occasionally, an\nopinion about whether to buy or sell a specific investment may be provided by\nthird parties. \u00a0The content is not intended to be a personal recommendation to\nbuy or sell any financial instrument or product, or to adopt any investment\nstrategy as it is not provided based on an assessment of your investing\nknowledge and experience, your financial situation or your investment\nobjectives.

        "content": "NAME:\u00a0Ng\u00a0Chiang Ling\n\nTITLE: Asia CIO\n\nCOMPANY: Hines\n\nNg Chiang Ling is a prominent figure in Asia's real estate investment landscape\nwith\u00a0over two decades of investment expertise.\n\nAs chief investment officer for Asia at\u00a0Hines, she\u00a0oversees the expansion of the\nfirm's $8 billion real estate portfolio and investor outreach across Asia\nPacific, and has played a pivotal role in developing its discretionary fund\nbusiness and global investment strategy.\n\nNg Chiang Ling\n\nBeyond Hines, Ng serves as chair of ANREV (Asian Association for Investors in\nNon-Listed Real Estate Vehicles), and is a passionate advocate for diversity,\nequity, and inclusion.\n\nThis year, she was identified as one of the\u00a0Leading Women in\nAlternatives\u00a0by\u00a0AsianInvestor.\n\nIn this week's Executive Exchange, Ng shares her investment beliefs,\u00a0her\nexcitement for\u00a0PropTech, and compares real estate investing to Monopoly.\u00a0\n\nWhat's one commonly accepted piece of investment wisdom you wholeheartedly\ndisagree with?\n\nThe notion that timing alone is a reliable strategy. This often involves trying\nto predict when to buy or sell assets based on short-term market fluctuations.\n\nInstead, I advocate investing for the longer term and in a mix of assets, spread\nacross regions and product types \u2013 a strategy based on diversification, asset\nallocation, and a disciplined approach.\n\nAn Asia allocation, I\u2019d argue, plays a valuable role in diversifying a global\ninvestment mix. It\u2019s a region with deep, compelling opportunities as a result of\nlong-term secular growth trends and unique in-market dynamics.\n\nWhich investment figure has been most influential to you throughout your career?\n\nI\u2019ve known and worked with Hines from my early days in the private equity real\nestate industry. I\u2019d say our firm\u2019s founder, Gerald D. Hines, has been very\ninfluential to me.\n\nHe left an indelible mark on the real estate industry. He transformed an\nentrepreneurial startup, founded in Houston in 1957, into a leading global real\nestate investment firm of today \u2013 one that manages a nearly $100 billion\nportfolio in a diversified pool of assets.\n\nIf you had to equate your investment strategy to a game, which would it be and\nwhy?\n\nReal estate investing shares similarities with Monopoly. In Monopoly, players\nacquire properties, develop them, and collect rent. Similarly, real estate\ninvestors buy properties, improve them (through renovations or active asset\nmanagement), and generate rental income.\n\nAnd just like in Monopoly, strategic decisions about property location,\nfinancing, and negotiation play a crucial role. However, unlike Monopoly, real\nestate isn\u2019t a zero-sum game \u2013 everyone can win.\n\n\n\nCan you recall a time when your gut feeling about an investment conflicted with\nthe data, and what did you do?\n\nAn investment decision needs to strike a balance between one\u2019s gut feeling and\nthe data.\u00a0 When the two are in conflict, the best course of action is to dig\ndeeper into why the two are conflicting.\n\nA gut feeling can be a function of length of experience in the business and risk\nappetite. Data may be inadequate because private markets are inherently opaque,\nthus the higher chance for higher returns.\n\nAnd that is why local expertise is crucial for real estate investment.\nExperienced in-market teams will be able to find the right assets, access\nattractive deals, and create value at the individual asset level.\n\nWhat innovation in asset management are you most excited about right now?\n\nIn the world of real estate, I\u2019d say the rise of property technology \u2013 or\nPropTech \u2013 is quite exciting. A significant amount of money is being poured into\nthis nascent space.\n\nPropTech is reimagining how we buy, sell, manage, and experience real estate \u2013\nfrom smart buildings with sensors to predictive analytics for future property\nperformance.\n\nWhich emerging market do you see as the most promising for investment and why?\n\nIndia. This is due to the country\u2019s strategic role as a manufacturing and\nbusiness offshoring hub, driven by its abundant human capital. As a result, more\njobs lead to increased spending power, opening up opportunities across various\nsectors.\n\nInvesting in real estate in India also offers regional diversification because\nits demand drivers are different from developed Asian markets. Deep local\nexpertise, however, is crucial to navigate across the market and succeed.\n\n\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone just starting their career in asset\nmanagement?\n\nFully understand institutional investors, who they are, why, and how they\u2019re\nfocusing on best-in-class assets with strong fundamentals, liquidity, and\ndurable cash flows.\n\nIt\u2019s equally important to network, learn, and stay curious.\n\nWhat's the most valuable lesson you've learned from an investment that didn't\npan out?\n\nThere are lessons to learn in every investment. One key lesson is the importance\nof adaptability. Investors must adjust their strategies when the facts change.\nDo not be emotionally attached to an investment.\n\nHow do you balance investor demands with sustainable investment practices?\n\nInvestors, as well as occupiers, are demanding more sustainable futures. For\nHines, investing in sustainability is good for business.\n\nAs real estate investors, managers, and developers, we need to think long-term.\nIf you\u2019re not investing in sustainability today, then you\u2019re settling for a\nbuilding of yesterday and not a building of tomorrow.\n\nSustainability continues to be a key part of creating value for properties.\nBeyond investing in sustainable assets, alpha can also be created by making\nexisting buildings greener.\n\nHow do you prepare for long-term uncertainties in the market?\n\nManaging uncertainty is the name of the game in asset management. Nimbleness and\npragmatism are important attributes.\n\nBeyond the numbers, what personal quality do you believe has contributed most to\nyour success?\n\nBeyond financial acumen and market knowledge, relationship-building plays a\npivotal role in real estate investment success.\n\nReal estate deals involve multiple stakeholders \u2013 buyers, sellers, brokers,\nlenders, and more. Building trust and fostering positive relationships lead to\nsuccessful outcomes.\n\nSo, cultivate relationships \u2013 they\u2019re the invisible foundations of a rewarding\ncareer.\n\n\n\nWhat is the most important leadership lesson you've learned while leading your\norganisation?\n\nSuccessful leaders understand the importance of connecting with their teams on a\nhuman level. Empathy fosters trust and loyalty, creating a solid foundation for\ncollaboration.\n\nClear vision is also equally crucial. Leaders guide their teams by inspiring\nresilience, especially in the face of challenges.\n\nThis article has been updated in the 3rd\u00a0para with Ng\u2019s new title at ANREV.\n\n\u00ac Haymarket Media Limited.

It conducts daily patrols as well as boarding and\nescort operations in the Singapore Strait, among other duties.\n\nA half-minute video posted by Dr Ng showed him speaking with Lieutenant-Colonel\nYe Yiming, the commanding officer of littoral mission vessel RSS Justice.\n\nIn his call made from the MSTF operations centre, the minister asked LTC Ye to\n\"tell (his) crew to continue their good work\".\n\nDr Ng added that the MSTF works closely with national agencies - the Immigration\nand Checkpoints Authority, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, Singapore\nCivil Defence Force, Singapore Customs and Singapore Police Force - to safeguard\nSingapore's territorial waters around the clock.\n\nThe intrusions into Singapore's territorial waters that Dr Ng referred to were\nmade by Malaysian government vessels.\n\nSingapore and Malaysia have been involved in a dispute over the Republic's\nterritorial waters off Tuas.\n\nOn Oct 25, Malaysia unilaterally extended the Johor Baru port limits such that\nthey encroached on Singapore's waters. Following that, 14 incursions by\nMalaysian vessels were recorded between Nov 24 and Dec 5.\n\nThere were two Malaysian ships in Singapore waters as of Monday (Dec 17), said\nTransport Minister Khaw Boon Wan then.\n\nBoth sides have agreed to meet in the second week of next month to discuss the\nmaritime dispute.",

The Central School grew out of the Arts\n& Crafts movement.\n\nThe school\u2019s first principal was the architect William Richard Lethaby. He\nremoved the barriers between the intellectualism of design and practical skills\nof production. He likened learning through theory and scholarship alone to\nlearning to swim out of water.\n\nBoth Saint Martin\u2019s School of Art and the Central School became known in the\n20th century for radical visual arts practice. In 1989, the two merged to become\nwhat is known today as Central Saint Martins.

ByteDance is the first truly global Chinese internet company. It was\nfounded in 2012 but gained more recognition after launching TikTok in 2016.\nTikTok rose to become the most relevant and popular app when the covid19\npandemic hit.

        "link": "https://www.nationalgrid.com/gt-announcement",
        "content": "National Grid plc ('National Grid') today announces that it has agreed to sell a\n60% equity interest in its UK gas transmission and metering business ('NGG') to\na consortium (the 'Consortium') of long-term infrastructure investors (the\n'Transaction').\u00a0\n\nThe Consortium is comprised of Macquarie Asset Management, a global asset\nmanager and the world\u2019s largest infrastructure manager, and British Columbia\nInvestment Management Corporation (BCI), one of Canada\u2019s largest institutional\ninvestors. As announced in March 2021, the Transaction forms part of National\nGrid\u2019s strategic pivot towards electricity and follows last year\u2019s acquisition\nof Western Power Distribution (WPD), the UK\u2019s largest electricity distribution\nbusiness, and announced sale of The Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) in the\nUS.\n\nThe terms of the Transaction imply an enterprise value for NGG of approximately\n\u00a39.6 billion[1]. On completion, National Grid will receive approximately \u00a32.2\nbillion in cash consideration\u00a0(subject to customary completion adjustments)[2].\nFollowing the Transaction, National Grid will own a 40% minority equity interest\nin NGG via a new holding company called 'GasT TopCo'. In addition, National Grid\nwill also receive approximately \u00a32.0 billion from additional debt financing at\ncompletion. As at March 2022, NGG\u2019s regulated asset value is estimated to be\napproximately \u00a36.6 billion and its net debt is estimated to be approximately\n\u00a33.8 billion.\n\nNational Grid has also entered into an option agreement with the Consortium for\nthe potential sale of the remaining 40% of equity in GasT TopCo (the 'Further\nInterest'). The option may be exercised by the Consortium between 1 January 2023\nand 30 June 2023 (subject to change depending on the timing of the closing of\nthe Transaction). If the option is exercised, the consideration for the Further\nInterest is expected to be paid in cash to National Grid on broadly similar\nterms to the Transaction, subject to adjustment for dividends paid in the\nbusiness at the time of exercise. Further details will be announced if the\noption is exercised.\n\nCompletion of the Transaction will be subject to certain antitrust and\nregulatory conditions. Subject to these clearances, National Grid expects that\nthe Transaction will complete in the second half of calendar year 2022.\n\nOn completion, the Transaction together with the proposed sale of NECO, will:\n\n * Increase the balance of National Grid\u2019s portfolio towards electricity, with\n   the proportion of the Group\u2019s assets in electricity growing from c.60% to\n   c.70%;\n * Significantly enhance National Grid\u2019s central role in the delivery of the\n   UK\u2019s net zero targets;\n * Underpin National Grid\u2019s 6 to 8% asset growth target for longer;\n * Enable National Grid to maintain a strong balance sheet with its strong\n   investment grade credit rating, supporting its sustainable dividend policy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1]Includes debt-like items and provisions of approximately \u00a30.2 billion.\n\n[2] Assuming expected completion in the second half of calendar year 2022.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nJohn Pettigrew, Chief Executive of National Grid, said:\u00a0\u201cThis transaction\nfurther enhances our role in delivering the UK\u2019s energy transition, pivots our\nportfolio towards electricity, whilst ensuring the security of the energy supply\nfor the country. Alongside our plans to invest up to \u00a335 billion in energy\ninfrastructure over the next five years, the series of transactions announced\nlast March will strengthen our long-term growth prospects, and drive long-term\nvalue for shareholders.\n\n\"Today\u2019s announcement is a strong result for all our stakeholders, including\nemployees and customers. The Consortium has a long-term commitment to the UK\nwith significant experience in owning and operating infrastructure assets. I\nlook forward to our partnership and continuing to deliver safe and reliable gas\nservice at the least cost to consumers. I would also like to thank my colleagues\nin Gas Transmission and Metering for their hard work that has helped us reach\nthis important milestone.\u201d\n\nMartin Bradley, Head of Macquarie Asset Management\u2019s Real Assets team in EMEA,\nsaid:\u00a0\u201cThe national transmission system is a critical enabler of the UK\u2019s energy\ntransition, providing the flexibility and reserve energy needed in the\nelectricity system as the deployment of renewable sources of generation\naccelerates. However, if the UK\u2019s net zero by 2050 target is to be met, the\ncountry must have a next-generation transmission backbone to power homes and\nbusinesses with renewable energy.\n\n\"Backed by our significant investment, the transmission system will play a\nleading role in making the network ready for this transition. In doing so it\nwill support the expansion of hydrogen\u2019s role in the energy mix to deliver a\ncompetitive edge to the UK and its industry, while working closely with the\nGovernment and Ofgem to maintain security of supply.\u201d\n\nLincoln Webb, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Infrastructure &\nRenewable Resources at BCI, said:\u00a0\u201cThis investment aligns well with our\ndiversified portfolio of regulated utilities that securely deliver critical\nservices to customers. We believe National Grid\u2019s innovative decarbonisation\nstrategy will ensure the business plays a leadership role in supporting the UK\nto achieve net zero carbon emissions on target by 2050, while meeting consumer\ndemand for reliable networks.\u201d\n\n\nFollowing completion of the Transaction, National Grid intends to use proceeds\nof approximately \u00a34.2 billion towards repayment of the bridge financing facility\nthat was drawn as part of the acquisition of WPD.

Of the amount, P25 billion will be drawn from the national government\nand P250 billion from government financial institutions: Government Service\nInsurance System (GSIS), Social Security System (SSS), Land Bank of the\nPhilippines (LBP), and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).\u00a0\n\nFACT\n\nBam Aquino, a cousin of the late president Benigno Aquino III, indeed filed a\nbill creating a sovereign wealth fund. However, Aquino\u2019s bill provided that\nfunding for the SWF would come from the General Appropriations Act. Ejercito\u2019s\nbill filed in 2018 had a similar funding provision.\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, the Maharlika Wealth Fund co-authored by House Speaker Martin\nRomualdez and Sandro Marcos proposes that the initial capitalization be drawn\nfrom the investible funds of GSIS (P125 billion), SSS (P50 billion), LBP (P50\nbillion), and DBP (P25 billion).\n\nIn a statement on Dec. 5, the former senator took exception to the comparison of\nthe Romualdez-Marcos proposal with his 2016 bill, pointing out that the capital\nfor a sovereign welfare fund should come from a budget surplus because it runs\nthe risk of losing. \u201cClearly, [funding] should not come from the workers\u2019\npension funds,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides, Aquino added:\u00a0\n\n> \u201cIbang-iba ang ekonomiya noong 2016 at ngayon \u2013 maganda ang takbo ng\n> ekonomiya, mataas ang economic growth, mababa ang utang ng gobyerno, at mababa\n> rin ang inflation.

        "link": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp",
        "content": "WHAT IS CASH FLOW?\n\nCash flow is the net cash and cash equivalents transferred in and out of a\ncompany. Cash received represents inflows, while money spent represents\noutflows. A company creates value for shareholders through its ability to\ngenerate positive cash flows and maximize long-term free cash flow (FCF).\nThis\u00a0is the cash from normal business operations after subtracting any money\nspent on capital expenditures (CapEx).\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of a company.\n * Cash received signifies inflows, and cash spent is outflows.\n   \n * The cash flow statement is a financial statement that reports a company's\n   sources and use of cash over time.\n * A company's cash flow can be categorized as cash flows from operations,\n   investing, and financing.\n\nInvestopedia / NoNo Flores\n\n\nFORMULA AND CALCULATION OF CASH FLOW\n\nYou can easily calculate a company's cash flow using the formula below. To do\nthis, make sure you locate the total cash inflow and the total cash outflow.\n\n> CF = TCI - TCO\n\nWhere:\n\n * TCI = Total cash inflow\n * TCO = Total cash outflow\n   \n\n\nUNDERSTANDING CASH FLOW\n\nCash flow refers to the money that goes in and out of a business. Businesses\ntake in money from sales as revenues (inflow) and spend money on expenses\n(outflow). They may also receive income from interest, investments, royalties,\nand licensing agreements and sell products on credit. Assessing cash flows is\nessential for evaluating a company\u2019s liquidity, flexibility, and overall\nfinancial performance.\n\nPositive cash flow indicates that a company's liquid assets are increasing,\nenabling it to cover obligations, reinvest in its business, return money to\nshareholders, pay expenses, and provide a buffer against future financial\nchallenges. Companies with strong financial flexibility fare better, especially\nwhen the economy experiences a downturn, by avoiding the costs of financial\ndistress.\n\nCash flows are analyzed using the cash flow statement, which is a standard\nfinancial statement that reports a company's cash source and use over a\nspecified period. Corporate management, analysts, and investors use this\nstatement to determine how well a company earns to pay its debts and manage its\noperating expenses. The cash flow statement is an important financial statement\nissued by a company, along with the balance sheet and income statement.\n\n\nCASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\nThe cash flow statement acts as a corporate checkbook to reconcile a company's\nbalance sheet and income statement. The cash flow statement includes the bottom\nline, recorded as the net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents (CCE).\n\nThe bottom line reports the overall change in the company's cash and its\nequivalents over the last period. The difference between the current CCE and\nthat of the previous year or the previous quarter should have the same number as\nthe number at the bottom of the statement of cash flows.\n\n\n\nTYPES OF CASH FLOW\n\n\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS (CFO)\n\nCash flow from operations (CFO) describes money flows involved directly with the\nproduction and sale of goods from ordinary operations. Also known as operating\ncash flow, CFO indicates whether or not a company has enough funds coming in to\npay its bills or operating expenses.\n\nOperating cash flow is calculated by taking cash received from sales and\nsubtracting operating expenses that were paid in cash for the period. Operating\ncash flow is recorded on a company's cash flow statement, indicates whether a\ncompany can generate enough cash flow to maintain and expand operations, and\nshows when a company may need external financing for capital expansion.\n\n\nCASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING (CFI)\n\nCash flow from investing (CFI) or investing cash flow reports how much cash has\nbeen generated or spent from various investment-related activities in a specific\nperiod. Investing activities include purchases of speculative assets,\ninvestments in securities, or sales of securities or assets.\n\nNegative cash flow from investing activities might be due to significant amounts\nof cash being invested in the company, such as research and development (R&D),\nand is not always a warning sign.\n\n\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING (CFF)\n\nCash flows from financing (CFF) shows the net flows of cash used to fund the\ncompany and its capital. CFI is also commonly referred to as financing cash\nflow. Financing activities include transactions involving issuing debt, equity,\nand paying dividends.\n\nCash flow from financing activities provides investors insight into a company\u2019s\nfinancial strength and how well its capital structure is managed.\n\n\n\nHOW TO ANALYZE CASH FLOWS\n\nUsing the cash flow statement in conjunction with other financial statements can\nhelp analysts and investors arrive at various metrics and ratios used to make\ninformed decisions and recommendations.\n\nFree Cash Flow\u00a0 FCF is a measure of financial performance and shows what money\nthe company has left over to expand the business or return to shareholders after\npaying dividends, buying back stock, or paying off debt.\u00a0 Unlevered Free Cash\nFlow\u00a0 UFCF measures the gross FCF generated by a firm that excludes interest\npayments, and shows how much cash is available to the firm before financial\nobligations.\u00a0 Operating Cash Flow\u00a0 OCF is money generated by a company\u2019s primary\nbusiness operation.\u00a0 Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio The ratio of a firm\u2019s net\ncash flow and net income with an optimum goal of 1:1. Current Liability Coverage\nRatio This ratio determines the company\u2019s ability to pay off its current\nliabilities with the cash flow from operations. Price to Money Flow Ratio The\noperating money flow per share is divided by the stock price.\n\n\nEXAMPLE OF CASH FLOW\n\nBelow is Walmart's (WMT) cash flow statement for the fiscal year ending on Jan.\n31, 2024. All amounts are in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nWalmart Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nInvestments in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and acquisitions of other\nbusinesses are accounted for in the cash flow from the investing activities\nsection. Proceeds from issuing long-term debt, debt repayments, and dividends\npaid out are accounted for in the cash flow from the financing activities\nsection.\n\nWalmart's cash flow was positive, showing an increase of $1.09 billion, which\nindicates that it retained cash in the business and added to its reserves to\nhandle short-term liabilities and fluctuations in the future.\n\n\nHOW ARE CASH FLOWS DIFFERENT THAN REVENUES?\n\nRevenue is the income earned from selling goods and services. If an item is sold\non credit or via a subscription payment plan, money may not yet be received from\nthose sales and are booked as accounts receivable. These do not represent actual\ncash flows into the company at the time. Cash flows also track outflows and\ninflows and categorize them by the source or use.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH FLOW AND PROFIT?\n\nCash flow isn't the same as profit. Profit is specifically used to measure a\ncompany's financial success or how much money it makes overall. This is the\namount of money that is left after a company pays off all its obligations.\nProfit is found by subtracting a company's expenses from its revenues.\n\n\nWHAT IS FREE CASH FLOW AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n\nFree cash flow is left over after a company\u00a0pays for\u00a0its\u00a0operating\nexpenses\u00a0and\u00a0CapEx. It is the remaining money after items like payroll, rent,\nand taxes. Companies are free to use FCF as they please.\n\n\nDO COMPANIES NEED TO REPORT A CASH FLOW STATEMENT?\n\nThe cash flow statement complements\u00a0the balance sheet and income statement. It\nis part of a public company's financial reporting requirements since 1987.\n\n\nWHY IS THE PRICE-TO-CASH FLOWS RATIO USED?\n\nThe price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a stock multiple that measures the value\nof a stock\u2019s price relative to its operating cash flow per share. This ratio\nuses operating cash flow, which adds back non-cash expenses such as depreciation\nand amortization\u00a0to net income.\n\nP/CF is especially useful for valuing stocks with positive cash flow but are not\nprofitable because of large\u00a0non-cash charges.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nCash flow refers to money that goes in and out. Companies with a positive cash\nflow have more money coming in, while a negative cash flow indicates higher\nspending. Net cash flow equals the total cash inflows minus the total cash\noutflows.",
        "summary": "The cash flow statement is a financial statement that reports a company's sources and use of cash over time. Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of a company. Assessing cash flows is essential for evaluating a company\u2019s liquidity, flexibility, and overall financial performance.",

        "link": "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-does-going-public-mean/",
        "content": "Going public refers to a private company's initial public offering (IPO), moving\nto a publicly traded and owned entity. Businesses usually go public to raise\ncapital in hopes of expanding.\u00a0Additionally, venture capitalists may use IPOs as\nan exit strategy\u00a0to reap their investment in a company they've invested in.\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * Going public refers to a private company's initial public offering (IPO) and\n   moving to a publicly traded and owned entity.\n * Going public helps a company raise capital to invest in future operations,\n   expansion, or acquisitions.\n * The process may diversify ownership, impose restrictions on management, and\n   open the company to regulatory constraints.\n\n\nIPO PROCESS\n\nThe IPO process begins with an investment bank to determine the number and price\nof company shares that will be issued. Investment banks complete the\nunderwriting, becoming owners of the shares and assuming legal responsibility\nfor them. The goal of the underwriter is to sell the shares to the public for\nmore than what was paid to the original owners of the company.\n\nOnce a privately held company is ready to go public or spinoff a portion of its\nbusiness into a new public entity, the formal process typically takes six\nmonths. The process involves investment bankers, attorneys, and accountants, who\nwork with management to navigate the IPO.\u00a0\n\n\n154\n\nThe number of U.S. companies that went public in 2023.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR LISTING\n\nUnderwriters commonly require that companies meet the following requirements\nbefore going public:\n\n * The company has predictable and consistent revenue, and the\u00a0business is\n   mature enough to predict the next quarter and the following year's expected\n   earnings.\n * There is extra cash to fund the IPO process.\n * There is growth potential in the business\u00a0sector.\u00a0\n * The company should be a top player in the industry.\n * A strong management team is in place.\n * Audited financials\u00a0are a requirement for public companies.\n * Strong business processes are in place.\n * The\u00a0debt-to-equity ratio\u00a0should be low. This ratio can be a factor in\n   derailing a successful IPO.\n * The company has a long-term\u00a0business plan\u00a0with financials spelled out for the\n   following three\u00a0to five\u00a0years.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF GOING PUBLIC?\n\nA company that decides to go public commonly strengthens its capital base, makes\nacquisitions easier, diversifies ownership,\u00a0and increases prestige.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF GOING PUBLIC?\n\nWhen a company goes public, it often creates pressure for short-term growth,\nincreases costs, imposes more restrictions on management and trading, forces\ndisclosure to the public,\u00a0and often strips former business owners of control.\n\n\nWHAT TYPES OF COMPANIES UNDERWRITE IPOS?\n\nSome of the largest IPOs in the United States have relied on companies such as\nMorgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and JP Morgan.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nThe timing of an IPO is crucial to avoid periods where the markets are\nunfavorable. To help ensure success, a private company should have factors in\nplace before going public, such as a business model with sustainable growth\npotential and a strong management team.",

        "link": "https://business.inquirer.net/432790/the-caveats-and-promises-of-maharlika-investment-fund",
        "content": "Republic Act No. 11954 constitutes the Maharlika Investment Corporation (MIC) as\nthe government-owned and -controlled corporation (GOCC) tasked with the\nmanagement of the Maharlika Investment Fund.\n\nThe capitalization is more outlined, with a capital stock of P500 billion to be\ndivided into P375 billion common shares and P125 billion preferred shares. Of\nthe P375 billion common shares, P125 billion shall be funded by Landbank, the\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines and the national government (NG). The\npreferred shares, on the other hand, are made available for subscription by the\nNG, its agencies or instrumentalities and GOCCs or government financial\ninstitutions, except the Social Security System, Government Service Insurance\nSystem, PhilHealth, Pag-Ibig, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration and the\nPhilippine Veterans Affairs Office. Private institutions, as well as other\nstate-owned financial institutions, may also be allowed to invest in the fund.\n\nThe law now explicitly states that government agencies and GOCCs providing for\nsocial security and public health insurance are prohibited from contributing.\n\nOne major red flag is the lack of safeguards to protect public funds from\nabuses, graft and corruption, money laundering or tax evasion.\n\nUnder RA 11954, the institution of independent directors, availability of\nFreedom of Information laws, mandatory disclosures of investment policies, the\nadoption of a financial reporting framework and compliance with the Santiago\nPrinciples were provided as safeguards. While there seems to be a lot, they may\nnot be sufficient to protect from possible abuses or gross incompetence or\nnegligence of the presidential appointees who will manage the funds.\n\nControversial provisions, such as the tax exemptions and the exemptions from the\nGovernment Procurement Reform Act, have been removed. There is no longer any\nprovision exempting the income from and assets of the fund from taxes, except\noutstanding tax liabilities of properties to be contributed by the Department of\nFinance \u2013 Privatization and Management Office. The law also explicitly states\nthat the Government Procurement Reform Act is applicable to the MIC.\n\n\n8.6% RETURN PROMISED\n\nAnother matter that we need to look at is the promised 8.6 percent return.\n\nUnder the law, Maharlika will be invested in: (1) cash, foreign currencies\nmetals, and other tradable commodities; (2) fixed income instruments, (3)\ndomestic and foreign corporate bonds, (4) listed or unlisted equities, (5)\nIslamic investments, such as sukuk bonds, (6) joint ventures or coinvestments,\nmergers and acquisitions, (7) real estate and infrastructure projects in line\nwith the national priorities, (8) programs and projects on health, education,\nresearch and innovation, and investments which contribute to sustainable\ndevelopment, (9) loans and guarantees and (10) other investments with\nsustainable and developmental impact.\n\nFrom these, we can only guess as to how the fund will achieve the 8.6-percent\nreturn, since there are no specifics on how investing in these listed projects\nwould really generate the alleged rate of return.\n\nThe implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of RA 11954 also recently warranted\nwatching out for. Preliminarily, it must be noted that the IRR provisions are\nstill within the bounds of the law. However, if the present iteration of the IRR\nis compared with the old IRR, there are some red flags. The qualification\nrequirements have been made more lax, warranting particular suspicion in light\nof the recent appointment of Rafael Consing Jr. as president and CEO of MIC.\nUnder the prior IRR, Consing would not have qualified for the position.\nMoreover, under the revised IRR, the functions and responsibilities of the audit\nand risk management committees are to be determined by the board of directors.\nThe composition and provision of the specific responsibility of the audit\ncommittee were removed and it is now reduced to a single section, which states\nthat the board shall organize an audit committee and prescribe its functions and\nmembership.\n\nThe responsibilities of the risk management committee were entirely removed,\nreplaced by the provision that its specific functions shall be determined by the\nboard.\n\nThe revised IRR also explicitly states that the president has the power to\naccept or reject recommendations by the advisory body for the positions of\nregular directors, independent directors and the president/CEO. Admittedly, that\npower has always been with the president, but the change still raises eyebrows.\n\n\nBEYOND THE LAW\n\nOther criticisms are external to the law itself and remain applicable.\n\nFirst, problems of transparency are tied with the levels of corruption in the\nPhilippines. While there are limitations and safeguards enshrined in the law,\nthere is no guarantee that these would be enough, especially since this is\nconsidered to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world.\n\nSecond, the Philippines still lacks a budget surplus. While forecasts of\neconomic growth generally portray it in a positive light and while inflation has\nslowed recently, the fact remains that the Philippines has a P250.9-billion\nbudget deficit as of September 2023. Moreover, data from the Bureau of Treasury\ncurrently pegs the country\u2019s debt at P14.35 trillion as of October 2023.\n\n\nUNTIMELY\n\nSovereign wealth funds are generally funded from budget surplus or funds arising\nfrom the exploitation of natural resources, such as oil and minerals. The\nPhilippines does not have that surplus. Instead, the Philippines will be\nallocating initially P125 billion and potentially up to P500 billion to fund the\nMIC.\n\nWhat is being criticized here is the timing of the law. Is now really the time\nfor the country to invest public funds into a sovereign wealth fund? The\ngovernment insists so and that the fund would bear fruit in the long-term. But\nthe Philippines faces several economic issues that could be exacerbated by the\nimplementation of the fund now.\n\nIn my opinion, there are more urgent bills and priorities that would have helped\nincrease tax revenues, domestic productivity and pay our government debts, such\nas lifting the Bank Secrecy Law, enacting general tax amnesty, empowering\nfisherfolk and farmers through artificial intelligence or integrating technology\nin the entire supply chain, requiring foreign tech giants to register and pay\nincome tax, among others.\n\nThere are also incidents, such as the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)\nscandal, which resulted in the loss of roughly $4.5 billion and an accrual of\n$7.8 billion in debt.\n\nThe public has to be more vigilant and skeptical as to its promised return until\nwe actually generate income and do not lose public funds.\n\nCorruption is a crime that is very difficult to trace and even harder to\nprosecute. This is why the public must be cognizant of their role as a pillar in\nfighting corruption\u2014by holding the government accountable for acts of\ncorruption. Failure to do so is tantamount to condoning corruption and allowing\nit to proliferate.
