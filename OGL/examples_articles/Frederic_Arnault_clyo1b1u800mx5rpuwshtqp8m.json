This latest sighting seems to signal that the pair aren\u2019t too\nbothered about hiding from prying eyes anymore.\n\nA few days before the event in Miami, the pair was seen on a simple, yet\nromantic date enjoying ice cream as they toured the idyllic grounds of Rodin\nMuseum in Paris.\n\nOnlookers took to Weibo commenting that Lisa and Frederic seemed at ease and\nwere not covering their faces with masks or sunglasses to hide their identities.\n\nThough neither party has made any official statement, Lisa indirectly confirmed\nthe sighting on her socials with a picture of herself at the museum.\n\nPhotos: Sinchew, kpopscoops/X, lalalalisa_m/Instagram",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- LVMH has chosen an eventual successor to its long-time chief\nfinancial officer as billionaire Bernard Arnault prepares a new generation of\nleaders to steer the world\u2019s biggest luxury group.\n\nThe parent company of Louis Vuitton appointed Cecile Cabanis as deputy finance\ndirector, reporting to CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony. A former CFO of French yogurt\nmaker Danone SA, Cabanis is currently deputy chief executive officer of Tikehau\nCapital.\u00a0\n\nCabanis, who starts on Monday, will join the executive committee, becoming the\nthird woman on the body alongside Delphine Arnault, the eldest child of the\nbillionaire CEO, and Chantal Gaemperle, 61, who\u2019s in charge of human resources.\n\nThe appointment of Cabanis is part of a wider management shake-up. Arnault, 75,\ngot a new deputy when Stephane Bianchi took over that role from Antonio Belloni\nafter April\u2019s annual general meeting.\n\nThe question of succession is of growing interest to observers of the world\u2019s\nlargest purveyor of high-end goods. Arnault\u2019s five children all hold key roles\nwithin the group, and four have been named to the company\u2019s board. They also\nhave oversight and management duties at family holding vehicles.\n\nThis week, the world\u2019s wealthiest person named his son Frederic Arnault, 29, as\nmanaging director of Financiere Agache, one of the holding companies through\nwhich the family controls its stake in LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE.\n\nTakeover Spree\n\nBernard Arnault, with a fortune of about $215 billion, according to the\nBloomberg Billionaires Index, has said he has no plans to retire. The family\nholds almost half of LVMH\u2019s share capital, with about 64% of the voting rights.\n\nDuring his two decades as CFO, Guiony has helped oversee acquisitions including\nTiffany & Co. \u2014 the biggest to date in the luxury industry \u2014 Bulgari, Loro Piana\nand Belmond. When Guiony joined from the investment bank Lazard Freres in\nSeptember 2003, initially as deputy CFO, the market capitalization of LVMH was\nabout \u20ac26 billion ($28 billion). It\u2019s now \u20ac381 billion, making the Paris-based\ngroup Europe\u2019s third-biggest company by market value.\u00a0\n\nArnault and Guiony also faced some M&A defeats, notably when an attempted\ntakeover in 2010 of Hermes International SCA failed. Guiony will get new,\nas-yet-undisclosed responsibilities at LVMH in due course, the company said.\u00a0\n\nDuring Guiony\u2019s tenure, the company has capitalized on booming global demand for\nluxury goods, especially in China. More recently, sales have slowed in that key\nmarket, but LVMH has been more resilient than rivals such as Gucci owner Kering\nSA.\n\n(Updates with more context throughout)\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nCatch all the Business News, Market News, Breaking News Events and Latest News\nUpdates on Live Mint.

Here with his kids, CEO of Rimowa,\nAlexandre Arnault, Frederic Arnault, Owner of LVMH Luxury Group and Louis\nVuitton's EVP Delphine Arnault.\n\nGetty Images\n\nEdits made to reflect recent role changes by the Arnault family.\n\nIn 2022 Bernard Arnault reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest individual\nfor the fourth time. The French billionaire is the founder, chairman and CEO of\nthe luxury goods company LVMH, the owner and CEO of Financi\u00e8re Agache SA, Groupe\nArnault (family office) and backer of the venture capital firm Agla\u00e9 Ventures.\n\nBernard Arnault is noteworthy due to his extraordinary business acumen and\nremarkable achievements. However, from a family office point of view, his unique\nmanagement style and how he has successfully positioned his family office and\nempowered the next generation to continue the Arnault family legacy sets him\napart from his peers.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT STYLE AS THE DIFFERENTIATOR\n\nArnault is best known for transforming the once nearly defunct LVMH into a\nmulti-billion dollar powerhouse that has become the world's largest luxury goods\nconglomerate, comprising over seventy brands and covering a wide range of\nproduct categories. A mastermind at stirring up desire in the most selective\nconsumers, Arnault's unique ability to harness the creativity that drives growth\nand profit is unprecedented.\n\nWhile many of his peers may seek a more predictable growth path, LVMH is\nrenowned for radical innovation and Arnault for not limiting this process.\nArtists are unfettered by financial and commercial concerns. This, Arnaut\nbelieves, is vital for producing their best work. No inspiration is checked, and\nno spirits are crushed. The seemingly outlandish suddenly makes perfect sense\nand is quickly turned into profit.\n\nArnault believes that with certain techniques, everybody wins \u2013 the designer,\nthe company and the customer. These techniques include hiring those who\nunderstand that creativity and chaos often go hand-in-hand and are respectful\nenough of the process to handle it. Yet, when it comes to translating that\ncreativity into products, discipline is the order of the day, and strict rules\nare applied to the planning and manufacturing process. Not many can master\nnavigating these fine lines, which sets Arnault apart in all he does.\n\nMoreover, Arnault's governance principles, including decentralized\ndecision-making centers, are applied to each entity within the LVMH group. This\nensures that each company retains its identity while financing the growth of new\nbrands.\n\n\nPROACTIVELY POSITIONING TO PROTECT THE FAMILY OFFICE\n\nIn 2022 it was announced that Arnault had altered the legal structure of his\nfamily office, Financi\u00e8re Agache SA, to a joint-stock partnership. The intent is\nto protect himself from dangerous takeover bids and ensure enduring family\ncontrol over the LVMH empire.\n\nFinanci\u00e8re Agache SA is managed by a team of professionals and works to ensure\nthe family's interests are served. It is also responsible for strategically\nmanaging the family's investments and ensuring its wealth is used to its full\npotential. It is also the executor of the family's philanthropic activities,\nensuring these are carried out effectively. In his family office, Arnault\ncreated the ideal vehicle for the successful transition of the business to the\nnext generation of the Arnault family.\n\n\nNEXT-GENERATION EMPOWERMENT\n\nBernard Arnault is acutely aware of the vulnerabilities divisions can cause. It\nis these divisions that have awarded him victories in several takeover battles.\nIn a series of calculated moves, Arnault has sought to prevent the same thing\nwithin his own family, laying the foundation upon which his empire will rest far\ninto the future.\n\nWhile Arnault has previously stated that \"Retirement is not a word in my\nvocabulary,\" each of his children is fully equipped and positioned within the\ncompany for when that day finally comes.\n\nArnault's children are all involved in group companies. Antoine is the CEO of\nBerluti, as well as Chairman of Loro Piana and head of image and communications\nat LVMH. Alexandre used to be the CEO of Rimowa, and then became Executive VP of\nProduct and Communications of Tiffany. His daughter, Delphine Arnault, was with\nLouis Vuitton and then became CEO of Christian Dior Couture early 2023. Her\nposition of influence within the group speaks volumes of her ambition and acumen\nin luxury fashion.\n\nArnault's commitment to passing the business on to his family is a testament to\nhis desire for the company to remain a successful and influential leader in the\nluxury goods space. The new joint structure is designed to prevent division and\nputs the family office and concerns in a strong position for the future, where\nit will become even more influential.",

The company\u2019s fashion and\n   leather goods division, which is its largest, saw a 9% year-over-year revenue\n   boost to 42.2 billion euros, and a 7% net profit increase to 16.8 billion\n   euros.\n * Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO, also moved to deepen his family\u2019s control\n   of the company by nominating two of his children, Alexandre Arnault and\n   Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, to fill vacant seats on the company\u2019s board of directors,\n   according to a separate press release, which noted that the board will vote\n   on the nominations in April.\n\n\nDIVE INSIGHT:\n\nThe positive earnings report had a ripple effect throughout the luxury industry.\nReuters reported on Friday that the pan-European STOXX 600 index \u201cwas up 0.9%,\nhitting its highest level in two years\u201d following LVMH\u2019s results, and the top 10\nEuropean luxury stocks \u201cgained 3.8%, tracking its best day since November 2022.\u201d\n\nLVMH said its fashion and leather goods division, which includes Louis Vuitton,\nChristian Dior, Celine, Fendi, Loro Piana, Loewe and Marc Jacobs, \u201cgained market\nshare worldwide and achieved record levels of revenue and profits.\u201d After\ndeclines in Q2 and Q3, LVMH\u2019s fashion and leather goods division posted Q4 a\nrevenue of 11.3 billion euros, making it the company\u2019s strongest quarter for the\nyear in any division.\n\nThe company touted the success of Louis Vuitton womenswear Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re,\nwho \u201crenewed his contract for a further five years.\u201d It also celebrated the July\n2023 Paris debut of Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton\nmenswear, whose show \u201csparked enthusiasm worldwide,\u201d per the release.\n\n\u201cOur performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and\ntheir ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and\ngeopolitical challenges,\u201d Arnault said in the release. \u201c...2023 also saw us make\nprogress in several key areas that are essential components of our long-term\nvision: protecting the environment, developing our talent, and preserving and\npassing on our expertise. While remaining vigilant in the current context, we\nenter 2024 with confidence.\u201d\n\nThe results represented a promising improvement after the market slowdown in Q3,\naccording to Alice Price, associate apparel analyst at data and analytics firm\nGlobalData.\n\n\u201cWhile this uplift is partly due to more favorable exchange rates\u2026it also\naffirms the desirability of its product offering, as it continues to persuade\nconsumers to make purchases against a backdrop of subdued consumer confidence in\nEurope and the US,\u201d Price said in emailed comments.\n\nShe added that Japan was LVMH\u2019s strongest region in 2023, followed by the rest\nof Asia, \u201cdriven by their growing economies and heightened appetite for high end\ngoods since the removal of lockdown restrictions at the end of 2022.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, Price said Europe\u2019s low-double digit growth was \u201csupported by the\nresurgence of international travel, but slowed significantly throughout the year\nto just 5% in Q4, as inflationary challenges impacted domestic demand.\u201d Sales in\nthe U.S. increased 4%, which Price attributed to low consumer confidence and\naspirational shoppers reigning in their discretionary spending.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHowever, US revenue rose by 8% in Q4 versus 2% in the prior quarter, indicating\nhope for its performance in the year ahead,\u201d Price said.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Arnault said the company was optimistic about its\nprospects.\n\n\u201cWhile the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, LVMH is\nconfident in its ability to continue to grow in 2024, in the highly distinctive\nquality and creativity that its products offer its customers, as well as in the\nprofessionalism of its management, to stand out and gain market share,\u201d Arnault\nsaid. \u201cLVMH will pursue its brand development-focused strategy, underpinned by\ncontinued innovation and investment as well as an extremely exacting quest for\ndesirability and quality in its products and their highly selective\ndistribution.\u201d",

        "link": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/working-life/lvmhs-arnault-trying-head-succession-battle",
        "content": "Bernard Arnault is aware of how succession can make a company vulnerable and how\ndivisions can prove fatal. He has exploited weaknesses in other family-run\nbusinesses including rival Hermes International to try and gain an upper hand in\ntakeover battles in the past.\n\nNow, the 73-year-old LVMH founder is using that knowledge in a bid to cement his\nfamily\u2019s control over the world\u2019s largest luxury goods company and prevent\nsibling infighting. The exercise is fraught, as fights within other famous\nbillionaire clans from the Murdochs to the Kochs and Ambanis can attest.\n\nThrough a series of moves over the past year, many of which have escaped public\nattention, Arnault has laid the groundwork he hopes will prevent such an outcome\nfor his own family empire. At the heart of the plan is a new holding company,\ncontrol of which is split equally among his five children. It already has power\nto influence major decisions affecting the luxury goods group. This is the\nvehicle the patriarch hopes will prevent divisions among his heirs and ensure\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE will remain under family control for decades\nto come.\n\nLeft unspoken in the plan is whether one of the five children will replace\nArnault in the operational role of chief executive officer of LVMH, the business\nhe created in the 1980s by merging the companies that now make up the name.\n\nThe potential contenders would be Delphine, 47, and Antoine, 45, from a first\nmarriage, and Alexandre, 30, Frederic, 28, and Jean, 24, a trio he had with his\nwife, the Canadian-born pianist Helene Mercier. Rapid growth, fuelled by global\ndemand across its 75-strong stable of brands ranging from Dom Perignon and Fendi\nto Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co, has made LVMH Europe\u2019s most valuable company,\nworth more than 400 billion euros (S$573 billion).\n\nSpeculation about the succession battle at LVMH was revived by the promotion in\nJanuary of Delphine to head the Christian Dior Couture brand, just as her\nbrother Antoine became CEO of a main holding company of the luxury group. Both\nhave spent decades climbing the corporate ranks. The three younger siblings are\nalso gravitating up through the group, adding to the impression of a race to the\ntop.\n\nBT IN YOUR INBOX\n\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered\nstraight to your inbox.\n\n\u201cEvery time there is transition, this is the most vulnerable period in the life\nof a family-controlled company,\u201d said Raffi Amit, a professor at the Wharton\nSchool of business, who studies wealth across generations at family firms.\n\u201cFamilies where each generation feels as though their role is to create wealth,\nrather than consume wealth, will sustain themselves for a much longer time.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe LVMH chairman and CEO, who replaced Elon Musk as the world\u2019s richest person\nin December, has no intention of stepping down anytime soon. In April, Arnault\norchestrated the raising of the age limit for his roles by five years to 80.\nObservers point to his vigorous health and fitness. At an earnings presentation\nin January he looked trim and was combative, dodging questions about the\nsuccession. Those who know him well say he is likely to try and extend the age\nrules again, with some even raising the possibility that he will die on the job.\n\nLVMH declined to make Arnault and his children available for interview about his\nsuccession plans.\n\n\n\u2018A WOLF IN CASHMERE\u2019\n\nArnault has never watched the HBO series Succession, said a person close to the\nLVMH boss, but he will be more than aware of the family dramas that fed the idea\nof the streaming show. His plan to hand the business to his children is an\nattempt to avoid the pitfalls that have bedevilled other families as wealth\nmoves from one generation to the next.\n\nThe billionaire Murdoch family, widely believed to be the inspiration for the TV\nshow, has seen bouts of bitter rivalry among children challenging for power\nwithin the empire of 91-year-old founder Rupert. In Asia, India\u2019s Ambani clan\nwill be forever scarred by the 2002 death without a will of the patriarch, which\npaved the way for a protracted public battle for control between his two sons,\nwho were both involved in the business at the time.\n\nAnother of the world\u2019s wealthiest people, Charles Koch, triumphed in a family\nfight. He and his three brothers inherited Koch Industries Inc from their\nfather, in 1967. A feud broke out and his brother William was ousted in 1980\nafter trying to wrest control. Charles and another brother David bought out\nWilliam and Frederick in 1983, but their legal disputes lasted for nearly two\nmore decades.\n\nIf there is any discord among the Arnault children, it has yet to seep into the\npublic domain. And none of them have shown any resistance to joining the family\nbusiness.\n\nArnault\u2019s fortune is up almost US$34 billion this year and is valued by the\nBloomberg Billionaires Index at US$196 billion. Last year, Arnault outlined \u2013 in\na four-page stock market filing \u2013 how LVMH ownership would look post-founder and\nin December reorganised his holding company, Agache SE, to protect the family\u2019s\nhold on power.\n\nAgache controls Christian Dior SE, which in turn holds 41 per cent of LVMH.\nOverall, the Arnault family owns 48 per cent of LVMH\u2019s share capital and has\nalmost 64 per cent of the voting rights, meaning that the chances of a predator\ngaining control of Europe\u2019s biggest company are practically nil.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for the heirs to understand is that if there is discord\nbetween them, these misunderstandings could affect the performance of the\ngroup,\u201d said Philippe Pele-Clamour, adjunct professor at business school HEC\nParis about the LVMH succession. \u201cThe problem will be even more complicated in\nthe generation after them, that of the grandchildren.\u201d\n\nThe critical switch contained in Arnault\u2019s succession plan was the\ntransformation of Agache SE into a limited joint-stock partnership, Agache SCA,\na corporate structure that permits a shareholder with a relatively small holding\nto have a huge sway. A measure described by one legal expert as a \u201cvery\nsignificant padlock\u201d.\n\nA notorious example in France was Lagardere SCA, which allowed second-generation\nscion Arnaud Lagardere to retain control of the industrial and media\nconglomerate he inherited, with just 7 per cent of the stock. His frittering\naway of the family fortune is considered the highest-profile succession debacle\nin recent French corporate history.\n\nThe LVMH founder plans to remain head of the joint partnership until another\nnewly-created company, Agache Commandite SAS, decides to remove him and take\nover. That holding is owned through equal stakes by his children. On paper, it\ngives the heirs a measure of power. In reality, there are likely to be\nconfidential conditions that dictate the circumstances required to trigger the\ntransition, leaving the founder firmly in control for the foreseeable future.\n\nAgache Commandite has a rotating, two-year chairmanship with Delphine taking the\nrole first, and a five-member board to guarantee a balance of power among the\nchildren. Key decisions such as doing away with Agache SCA \u2013 the joint\npartnership \u2013 when their father dies or carrying out a major strategy change at\nthe Christian Dior SE holding or LVMH would require unanimous board approval.\n\nArnault has long held regular, formal meetings with his children at LVMH\nheadquarters to discuss business. But in the new plan, he added a requirement\nthat the siblings be involved in major decisions affecting the luxury empire\nwith immediate effect.\n\nWhile he maintains broad powers over Agache SCA, \u201ccertain important decisions\u201d\nlike those surrounding LVMH strategy, the appointment or removal of board\nmembers, top executives and dividend payments will require consultation with the\nchildren via Agache Commandite. This will hold for at least the next decade or\nuntil the father is no longer at the helm.\n\nThe children cannot sell their shares in Agache Commandite for 30 years without\nunanimous board approval and no partner in the company can come from outside one\nof the five bloodlines. After this period lapses, only direct descendants of\nBernard Arnault will be able to hold the shares, with the family having\npreemptive rights.\n\nLVMH investors have largely shrugged off the children\u2019s new-found power,\nsatisfied with the brands\u2019 performance and the prospects of post-pandemic growth\nin China.\n\nSuccession faultlines have been weaponised by Arnault in the past. One\ndescendant of the Hermes dynasty called the LVMH founder \u201ca wolf in cashmere\u201d\nafter he launched a failed bid to take over the rival luxury group and laid bare\nweaknesses in the family\u2019s shareholding defenses. The sowing by Arnault of\nfamily friction to his own advantage goes back even further, when he partnered\nwith, and then ousted, heir Henry Racamier to gain control of the Louis Vuitton\nbusiness in the 1980s.\n\n\nFAMILY AFFAIR\n\nFamilies who have been able to sustain vast wealth over a very long period of\ntime are relatively few and far between. In the US, they include the Mars clan\nbehind the eponymous candy company and the agro-giant dynasty of the\nCargill-MacMillans, in their fifth and seventh generations, respectively. In\nFrance, the family behind Hermes used Arnault\u2019s attack to batten down the\nhatches, strengthening its control, installing a sixth-generation descendant as\nCEO and enjoying the fruits of an almost 900 per cent share price increase since\nOctober 2010, when LVMH announced it had purchased a stake in the Birkin maker.\n\nYet, even when harmony is sustained, profitability doesn\u2019t always follow. Fund\nmanager Carmignac studied the stock market performance of hundreds of family\nbusinesses, and found that between January 2004 and October 2022 they\noutperformed their non-family counterparts. Over time, however, the research\nshows that there is a diminishing return and that family-owned companies managed\nby the first generation gained almost twice as much value as those run by the\nfifth.\n\nThe decline is blamed on a number of factors from a lack of reinvestment of\nprofits by subsequent generations to not having the same philosophy as a\nsuccessful founder, according to analyst Obe Ejikeme. Governance is also a risk\nsince the top management of family firms tend to remain in place for longer.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, the Arnault offspring still have not been\ntrusted to head the companies that make up the lion\u2019s share of LVMH profits,\nwhich the founder has kept in the hands of trusted lieutenants from outside the\nfamily who have in many cases mentored the heirs.\n\nSales at Louis Vuitton, the biggest LVMH label, crossed 20 billion euros last\nyear. It has been run for the past decade by Michael Burke and is now headed by\nPietro Beccari, the former CEO of Dior, as part of the broader reshuffle which\nelevated Delphine.\n\nLVMH does not break out the profitability of each of its brands, but analysts at\nHSBC in December put Louis Vuitton at the top of the list with an estimated 11\nbillion euros in 2022, three times more than Delphine\u2019s new remit Dior Couture.\nAnd while Tiffany contributed more than one billion euros in profit last year,\nLoro Piana, the cashmere brand, watchmaker Tag Heuer and shoemaker Berluti \u2013 all\noverseen by the children, don\u2019t feature in the top 10 of the brands analysed by\nHSBC.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether one of the children really wants to be the operational\nhead of the group,\u201d Pele-Clamour said. \u201cOr do they consider that their duty and\nmission is to exercise control without necessarily being CEO. Maybe one would be\nchairman of the board.\u201d\n\nShould Arnault opt for a CEO from outside the family, Italian-born Antonio\nBelloni, 68, might be an option. The deputy CEO joined the firm in 2001 and is\npart of the company\u2019s executive committee and, like Delphine and Antoine, sits\non the board.\n\n\u201cIt probably would be helpful for Bernard Arnault to appoint a replacement,\nthere would probably be less friction if he does,\u201d Amit said. \u201cbut it appears\nthere is no rush to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important,\u201d he added, to minimise poisonous rivalry among the heirs,\n\u201cisn\u2019t just who will be appointed but the process by which this is done.\u201d\n\nBernard Arnault \u201chas a very smart family around him, he\u2019s putting them in a\nposition to get trained, to progress, to be more relevant when it comes to the\nbusiness,\u201d LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told Bloomberg on\nthe sidelines of the group\u2019s annual results. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s\nlaunching one more than the others in a perspective of succession. I\u2019m not even\nsure he himself knows his plans.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile some say there\u2019s an element of competition between Alexandre and Frederic,\nwho are close in age, this could be seen as a healthy emulation for the group in\nthe eyes of their father, who has always fostered a degree of rivalry among LVMH\nlabels.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a favourite brand,\u201d Arnault quipped in October when asked about\nhis preference among the LVMH labels. \u201cHow can one say that one prefers one of\nhis children?\u201d BLOOMBERG",

Don\u2019t\nforget to subscribe to the Glossy Podcast for interviews with fashion industry\nleaders and Week in Review episodes, and the Glossy Beauty Podcast for\ninterviews from the beauty industry. \u2013Danny Parisi, sr. fashion reporter\n\n\nLUXURY BRANDS LOOK TO CATEGORY EXPANSION AND CHINA TO GET THROUGH THE SLOWDOWN\n\nIn the ongoing luxury slowdown, even Kering isn\u2019t safe. The company announced\nits latest earnings on Thursday, revealing that its operating profits fell by\n15% last year and that it expects the same will happen this year, as well. Sales\nacross most of its brands and divisions were down. Gucci, its largest fashion\nbrand, saw a 4% drop.\n\nTo prepare for continued slowdowns in fashion sales, Kering has been revving up\ninvestment in its fragrance arm. Last year, Kering spent nearly $4 billion to\nacquire the perfumery Creed, and it plans to release fragrances from three of\nits top brands \u2014 Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen \u2014 this year.\n\nThis sort of category expansion is becoming more common across the major luxury\ngroups. For Kering, it\u2019s beauty through its new Kering Beaut\u00e9 arm. Richemont is\nalso investing in beauty as an avenue for expansion, launching its own beauty\ndivision in September of last year. And for LVMH, it\u2019s watches. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\nArnault, the new CEO of the newly created LVMH Watches division, is planning to\nmake LVMH and its 10 watch brands into a major horological player.\n\nWhether these new expansions will help the conglomerates avoid the ongoing\nluxury slowdown remains to be seen. But not all major luxury groups are having\nas tough a time as Kering. Tapestry raised its profit forecast this week, citing\nhigher demand for its handbags in mainland China and less significant but still\npositive sales growth in Europe. Sales for Tapestry grew 19% in China and 11% in\nEurope last quarter.\n\nRalph Lauren also saw positive growth thanks to strength in China. In its\nearnings report last week, Ralph Lauren showed its revenue increased 24%\nglobally and 30% in China over the last quarter.\n\nLuxury brands across the industry are seeing the resilience of the Chinese\nluxury market. Last week, Loewe announced a new Jonathan-Anderson-curated\nimmersive brand exhibition that will open in Shanghai in March. It will include\nartifacts from the brand\u2019s history and a look at its design and creation\nprocess. According to the brand, it\u2019s its first major exhibition, and China was\nchosen due to the strength of the local Loewe customer.",

        "content": "PARIS \u2014 Global demand for luxury goods may be slowing, but Bernard Arnault is\nalways eyeing a bigger slice of the pie.\n\nSpeaking after LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported another year of record\nresults, the tycoon said he has no intention of breaking up his group, which\nposted sales of 86.15 billion euros in 2023. Rather, he\u2019s tightening his\nfamily\u2019s grip on its leadership and continues to target growth.\n\nIn the latest move to prepare his succession, Arnault, who turns 75 in March,\nconfirmed that the luxury conglomerate will propose the appointments of his sons\nAlexandre Arnault and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault to the board at the next annual general\nmeeting, to be held on April 18.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fashionable right now in a lot of countries to bring in younger\nleadership. Well, we\u2019re getting younger too, even if I\u2019m not planning to go\nanywhere either in the short term or long term. I prefer to let that be known\nstraight away because you might ask me about it, so rest easy,\u201d the LVMH\nchairman and chief executive officer told analysts and reporters.\u00a0\n\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nAlexandre Arnault, executive vice president of product and communications at\nU.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, CEO of LVMH Watches, will join\ntheir siblings Antoine Arnault, head of communication, image and environment at\nLVMH, and Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, on the\nboard.\n\nThat leaves the youngest sibling, Jean Arnault, who is in his mid-20s and is\nmarketing and product development director for watches at Louis Vuitton. \u201cHe\u2019s\ngot time, he\u2019s young,\u201d Arnault told reporters on the margins of the press\nconference at the company\u2019s headquarters in Paris.\n\nSpeaking to a small group of journalists, the executive quashed suggestions that\nLVMH should break up its business to unlock value for investors.\u00a0\n\nThis follows an article this week by Bloomberg Opinion columnist Andrea Felsted\npointing out that LVMH is trading at a steep discount to Herm\u00e8s because of the\ndisparate nature of its businesses, which include Louis Vuitton and Dior, as\nwell as beauty retailer Sephora, but also wines and spirits, duty-free retailing\nand hospitality.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t consider it under any circumstances. I find it completely\ninappropriate,\u201d Arnault said of the suggestion to split LVMH. \u201cIf our financial\nservices are dynamic enough, we must significantly increase our\nprice-to-earnings ratio without any spin-off, because that would be a mistake,\nsince the group is built precisely on this diversity of brands.\u201d\n\nHe said LVMH was likely to get even fatter, whether through acquisitions or\norganic growth. Citing another recent newspaper article during his opening\nspeech, he said Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel and Herm\u00e8s were considered the\nmarket leaders in soft luxury, and Tiffany, Bulgari, Cartier and Van Cleef &\nArpels the top four in hard luxury.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAmong the eight brands that I consider to be the best in the world, we have\nhalf, which is already quite good. We\u2019ll see what happens later, if we manage to\nexpand the scope a little, or if we manage to push some other brands to join the\nfirst four,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing past rumors that LVMH was interested in acquiring rival Compagnie\nFinanci\u00e8re Richemont, Arnault was playful, after chairman Johann Rupert\nreiterated last year that he has no plans to sell Richemont or its star brand\nCartier.\n\n\u201cI consider Mr. Rupert an exceptional leader and I have no desire to interfere\nwith his strategy. I understand that he\u2019s keen to remain independent,\u201d Arnault\nsaid. \u201cI think it\u2019s very good and if he needs support to retain his\nindependence, I will be there,\u201d he added to chuckles from the room.\n\nThe executive said he expected growth to remain stable in 2024 versus the prior\nyear. It promises to be a banner period for LVMH, which is a premium partner of\nthe Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m very confident,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see the\nimpact of future interest rate cuts, and I also expect a positive impact on the\nU.S. economy from the upcoming [presidential] election. Each time there\u2019s an\nelection in the U.S., the market is more dynamic.\u201d\n\nOn the risk side, he raised the prospect of a spiraling of the conflicts in\nEastern Europe and the Middle East. \u201cThat is the main concern I see for 2024.\nAside from that, I think the economic outlook will be better overall for our\nproducts,\u201d he said. \u201cOddly enough, the strongest demand is for the most premium\nproducts.\u201d\n\nHe also sought to put a positive spin on the normalization of the luxury\nindustry\u2019s growth rates after three years of post-pandemic euphoria.\n\nIn results reported after the market close on Thursday, LVMH said like-for-like\nsales at its key fashion and leather goods division rose 9 percent in the fourth\nquarter, in line with market expectations. Arnault noted that after several\nyears of double-digit organic revenue growth, Dior was now performing in line\nwith the segment\u2019s overall progression.\n\n\u201cWe have reached a stage where we no longer need such strong growth and for me,\nbetween 8 and 10 percent is ideal,\u201d he said, noting that he prefers to focus on\nthe desirability of his brands with exclusive products, rather than chasing\nhigher sales. \u201cI would rather hit the brakes than the accelerator.\u201d\n\nChief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony noted that the group\u2019s average\nannual organic growth rate over the last 35 years was 9.1 percent.\u00a0\n\nLVMH\u2019s sales growth slowed in the second half of 2024, although there was a\nslight improvement in the fourth quarter, thanks to the strong performance of\nits selective retailing and perfume and cosmetics divisions, and an easier\ncomparison basis with the same period last year when much of China was in\nlockdown due to COVID-19.\n\nOverall group sales were up 5.5 percent at actual exchange rates to 23.95\nbillion euros in the three months ended Dec. 31, following a 1 percent increase\nin the previous three months. This represented a rise of 10 percent on a\nlike-for-like basis, up from the 9 percent recorded in the third quarter.\n\nTo help future-proof its strategy, LVMH kicked off the year with several senior\nexecutive changes.\u00a0\n\nGroup veteran Michael Burke is set to succeed Sidney Toledano at the head of\nLVMH Fashion Group, overseeing Celine, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs,\nPatou and Emilio Pucci. It is understood Burke\u2019s stable of brands will be\nexpanded to include Fendi.\n\nToledano will leave the LVMH executive committee and become an adviser to\nBernard Arnault in the handover, which takes effect on Feb. 1. Arnault said\nSt\u00e9phane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH\u2019s watches and jewelry division, would also move on\nto a new role, though he declined to elaborate.\n\nFrench businessman Henri de Castries is also among the nominees to join the\nboard, following the decision by Charles de Croisset, Yves-Thibault de Silguy\nand Nicolas Bazire to not stand for reelection as directors.\n\nLVMH shares have fallen by more than 23 percent over the last six months amid a\nglobal slowdown in luxury demand. In late August, LVMH was overtaken as Europe\u2019s\nmost valuable listed company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the\nmaker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nIts fourth-quarter report comes on the heels of mixed results for its luxury\npeers.\n\nBurberry lowered its full-year profit guidance after disappointing holiday\nsales, but Richemont beat expectations thanks to strong demand for jewelry in\nmarkets such as Japan, mainland China and North America.\n\nMeanwhile, Brunello Cucinelli said results in the fourth quarter were the best\never in absolute value, with sales up 15.6 percent year-over-year. Kering is due\nto report full-year results on Feb. 8, with Herm\u00e8s International set to follow\non Feb. 9.",

        "link": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/retail/vestiaire-collective-crowdfunding-resale/",
        "content": "Vestiaire Collective\u2019s announcement of a crowdfunding campaign earlier this week\nraised some eyebrows.\n\nThe luxury platform\u2019s previous backers were the opposite of grassroots: it\u2019s\nraised $744 million over 12 rounds, including one in 2021 that included Kering\nand Tiger Global Management, one of the world\u2019s biggest backers of start-ups.\nOne million euros ($1.09 million) in small contributions from individuals is a\ndeparture, to say the least.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions about the impact of high interest rates or the\nluxury slowdown on resale start-ups, we figured it was best to ask Vestiaire\nchief executive Max Bittner about the motivations behind the campaign.\n\nTurns out, it\u2019s not really about the money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a drop in the bucket,\u201d chief executive Max Bittner told The Business of\nFashion. \u201cThis fundraiser was not even the idea of the finance department, it\nwas the idea of the marketing department.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tactic that has been tried before, including by AllBirds in 2016 before\nit eventually listed in 2021. Not only does it make noise in the market and\nboost ties with loyal customers, the sacrifice is minimal: companies are\ntypically not obliged to appoint a crowdfunding representative to their board\nand shares do not carry voting rights.\n\nVestiaire has its eyes on bigger investors down the line, of course. The\nstart-up, founded in 2009 in Paris, is reportedly aiming for an initial public\noffering in 2025.\n\nThat may prove a tougher sell. The track record for fashion resale platforms on\nthe stock market is pretty dismal. Poshmark hit a peak valuation of $7.5 billion\nwhen it listed in January 2021, but its share price fell more than 80 percent\nbefore it was acquired by Korean e-commerce company Naver in October 2022.\nShares of The RealReal trade around $2 after debuting above $30 in June 2019.\n\nCompetition is fierce, particularly in the US, where Vestiaire is in the middle\nof an aggressive expansion push headed by Samina Virk, who was appointed a year\nago, and Bittner himself has also relocated to New York from Paris. In addition\nto Poshmark and The RealReal, there\u2019s Depop, still going strong under Etsy,\nnumerous niche start-ups competing to re-sell bags, jewellery and other\ncategories. Brands such as Maje, Sandro, and Lululemon have their own direct\nsecondhand sales now. Peer-to-peer rental services such as Pickle, By Rotation\nand Tulerie have a similar proposition of luxury for less, while Shein and Temu\noffer dupes by the thousands.\n\nAnd of course there\u2019s eBay, the original secondhand giant, which has recently\nstepped up its efforts in higher end fashion and watches, including an\naccessories verification programme in partnership with various brands. It also\nheld an offline pop-up \u201cCanal Street Wear,\u201d which featured clothing from\ntop-rated eBay sellers. (Ebay has had its own struggles, announcing this week it\nwould cut 9 percent of its workforce, about 1,000 employees.)\n\nStill, there are reasons to be optimistic that Vestiaire Collective can succeed\nwhere The RealReal couldn\u2019t (or at least, hasn\u2019t yet). The \u201cnormalisation\u201d of\nluxury spending flagged by LVMH this week is in part the result of aspirational\nconsumers being priced out of buying new Hermes or Chanel bags. In another bad\nsign for luxury brands, this past week, the four biggest US banks reported\nhigher credit card spending in 2023 compared with the previous year, and that\ncardholders were taking longer to pay down their debt, according to analysis\nthis week by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThose newly cash-strapped shoppers might now turn to resale sites for bargains.\nVestaire Collective\u2019s revenue grew a healthy 25 percent in 2023, according to\nBittner, slower than it was two years ago but showing signs of picking up. The\ncompany is also on track to be profitable sometime this year, he said.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have an environment where people are more cautious but if\nanything, we\u2019ve seen actually an improvement of the environment over the last, I\nwould say, four to eight weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business is as healthy as I\u2019ve\nseen it in the last five years since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\nBittner said he\u2019s more focused on executing his existing plan than the wider\nuniverse of resale, rental, fast fashion, new luxury and beyond.\n\n\u201cIf my competition is everything from the first market of Hermes to Shein and\nTemu then I\u2019m going to go crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to launch new markets\nand launch new categories. I don\u2019t need to pivot. I just need to do more of the\nsame. And that will get me to where I need to be by the end of 2024.\u201d\n\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF\n\nFASHION, BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nLVMH\u2019s fourth quarter sales grow 10 percent.

He\u00a0has also invested in Boo.com and a\nvariety of other online ventures, as well as buying Princess Yachts outright.\n\nArnault began his career working for his father\u2019s manufacturing company. Five\nyears into the position, he convinced his father to liquidate the construction\ndivision and enter the real estate market. Under the name F\u00e9rinel, the new\ncompany initially developed specialty holiday accommodations. Named a director\nof the company in 1974, he became chief executive in 1977. In 1979, he succeeded\nhis father as president of the company.\n\nIn 1984, with the help of Antoine Bernheim, a senior partner of financier Lazard\nFr\u00e8res et Cie,\u00a0Arnault acquired Financi\u00e8re Agache, becoming chief executive and\ntaking control of Boussac, a beleaguered textile company which owned, among\nother assets, Christian Dior and the department store Le Bon March\u00e9. Arnault\nused this foothold in the luxury business to begin building what would become\nthe world\u2019s largest luxury conglomerate.\n\nOver the next 11 years, LVMH\u2019s value multiplied fifteen times over and sales and\nprofit increased fivefold. One of the key factors in the company\u2019s success has\nbeen Arnault\u2019s programme of decentralisation and his efforts to highlight each\nbrand\u2019s heritage, so that each company is viewed independently in its own right.\n\nIn 1993, LVMH acquired Berluti and Kenzo. In the same year Arnault bought out\nthe French economic newspaper La Tribune, which he later sold, reinvesting in\nthe newspaper business by buying Les Echos.\n\nOver the succeeding years, along with scores of acquisitions in the drinks\nmarket, Arnault earned his sobriquet \u201ca wolf in cashmere,\u201d by acquiring\nGivenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs , Sephora, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Loro Piana,\nNicholas Kirkwood , Thomas Pink, R.M Williams, EDUN, Moynat and Donna Karen,\nalong with a host of jewellery brands, including TAG Heuer, De Beers and\nBulgari. Arnault\u2019s business activities have been interpreted by many as\nindicating the executive is firmly set on acquiring Herm\u00e8s. However, the Herm\u00e8s\nfamily has thus far publically rebuffed Arnault\u2019s advances, winning legal action\nagainst LVMH, and taking steps to prevent further investment in Herm\u00e8s by\nArnault.\u00a0\n\nIn October 2020, Arnault closed the acquisition of Tiffany to join LVMH. The\nacquisition adds to Arnault\u2019s luxury group.\n\nArnault has been married twice and has five\u00a0grown children, four of whom \u2014\nDephine, Antoine, Alexandre and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric \u2014\u00a0work within the business.

        "link": "https://www.thefashionlaw.com/lvmh-succession-planning-arnault-appears-to-be-keeping-it-in-the-family/",
        "content": "In the world of luxury and heritage, while brands, themselves, have largely\ntransformed from small family-owned entities to conglomerate-owned companies, a\nnumber of luxury\u2019s biggest groups are owned and managed by the original founding\nfamily. The issue of succession planning, therefore, can be particularly\nimportant. This has recently come to the fore for the founder of the world\u2019s\nlargest luxury conglomerate, LVMH, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, as there\nhas been much speculation over Arnault\u2019s succession plan. The 75-year-old\nfounder, chairman, and CEO of LVMH raised his retirement age from 75 to 80 in\n2022, which should keep him at the helm of the \u20ac440 billion empire for another\nfew years at least.\u00a0\n\nSuccession speculation ramped up again this month when two more of Arnault\u2019s\nfive children were appointed to the LVMH board at the group\u2019s annual\nshareholders meeting in Paris, with LVMH shareholders giving the greenlight\nto\u00a0the nominations of Alexandre and Frederic Arnault, who will join their older\nsiblings, Delphine and Antoine Arnault.\u00a0The move leaves just one offspring,\nyoungest son Jean, without a seat (although he is employed at the firm). It also\ngives the family 48.6 percent of LVMH\u2019s share capital and 64.3 percent of the\nvoting rights.\n\nIn light of the changing nature of luxury consumption, prompted by globalization\nin the sector and an influx of younger luxury shoppers across the globe, LVMH\u2019s\nlatest succession planning move allows the infusion of fresh perspectives and\nideas, and helps the company to be agile and adapt to evolving tastes and\ntrends. After all, the two latest Arnault appointments are young \u2013 aged just 29\nand 31. Beyond merely an aim to bring younger members into the fold, a\nwell-executed succession plan also provides stakeholders with a sense of\nstability and confidence in the business\u2019s trajectory, mitigating uncertainties\nand fostering trust in the brand\u2019s resilience.\n\n\nTHE WORKINGS OF A CONGLOMERATE\n\nLVMH is not the only luxury group with familial management. Others, including\nHerm\u00e8s, Chanel, Richemont, and Prada, among others, also adhere to this\ntradition. But LVMH \u2013 which boasts a glittering portfolio of brands ranging from\nLouis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, Bulgari, Hublot, and TAG Heuer to Mo\u00ebt & Chandon \u2013\nstands out as the largest multi-brand luxury conglomerate predominantly\ncontrolled by a single family.\u00a0This wide array of strong brands provides LVMH\nwith distinct advantages, including economies of scale, diversified revenue\nstreams and increased bargaining power with suppliers and retailers.\u00a0\n\nAt the same time, multi-brand luxury conglomerates like LVMH also face unique\nchallenges compared to mono-brand enterprises. First, harmonizing brand\nidentities and ensuring consistency across product lines and market segments\nposes a formidable task. Each brand boasts its own lineage, ethos, and customer\nbase, which need to be carefully navigated to preserve individual\nidentities.\u00a0Resource allocation across brands with diverse needs demands a\ndelicate equilibrium. Investment decisions must align with each brand\u2019s growth\npotential, market positioning and strategic objectives, while also safeguarding\nthe conglomerate\u2019s overall financial health and longevity.\u00a0\n\nStill yet, internal competition between the brands for market share, resources\nand talent means there needs to be clear delineation of roles and mechanisms.\nCollaboration without encroaching on brand autonomy is the name of the game.\n\n\nFAMILY STRATEGY V. LOOKING OUTSIDE\n\nBernard Arnault\u2019s career at LVMH spans several decades, marked by bold\nacquisitions and strategic expansions, and real estate prowess. Under his\nstewardship, LVMH has emerged as a global powerhouse. In his succession plan for\nLVMH, Arnault has strategically positioned his children \u2013 Antoine, Delphine, and\nAlexandre \u2013 in key leadership roles within the company.\u00a0Antoine Arnault, the\neldest son, has emerged as a prominent figure within the firm, responsible for\nguiding the strategic direction of LVMH\u2019s retail businesses. Delphine Arnault,\nthe eldest daughter, holds an important position within LVMH\u2019s fashion division,\nwhich encompasses some of the world\u2019s most iconic luxury brands.\u00a0As the\nexecutive vice president of Louis Vuitton, Delphine oversees the strategic\ndevelopment and expansion of the brand. Alexandre Arnault has been entrusted\nwith spearheading LVMH\u2019s technology and digital initiatives, reflecting the\nconglomerate\u2019s approach to innovation and growth.\n\nIt can sometimes pay dividends to keep things in the family. However,\nconsidering the challenges associated with heritage conglomerates, such as LVMH,\nappointing an external leader can offer certain advantages. External leaders,\nfor instance, can bring fresh perspectives and impartiality, unhampered by\ntricky familial biases or dynamics. This impartiality can be invaluable in\nnavigating intra-group conflicts, fostering collaboration between brands, and\npropelling innovation.\u00a0\n\nBringing in an outsider can also mitigate risks tied to family dynamics, such as\nconflicts of interest or succession-related tensions, fostering a meritocratic\nculture where qualifications and performance are given priority. But when a\nbrand is so closely tied to one family name, introducing an external leader may\nlead to resistance from family members worried about a departure from\ntradition.\u00a0\n\nPlus, the process of assimilating an external leader into the\u00a0organization\u2019s\nethos\u00a0and aligning their vision with long-term strategic objectives can be a\nfine line to tread, and stakeholders must also be on board.\n\nSuccession planning in the luxury sector is a complex process that requires a\ncareful balance of tradition, innovation, and leadership. It serves as a\ncustodian of the brand\u2019s essence and a safeguard of its legacy in a complex\nmarketplace. Getting the succession plan right, whether that means keeping\nthings in the family or looking outside for new leadership, is crucial to\nmaintain continuity and prosperity.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQing Wang is a Professor of Marketing and Innovation and the Director, Marketing\nInnovation at Warwick Business School.

Their father had\nraised all of them since they could walk to one day run the LVMH conglomerate.\n\nThe occasion was Mr. Arnault\u2019s announcement that LVMH would provide 150 million\neuros (about $161 million) to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics. LVMH companies\nwill play a starring role. Chaumet, a Paris jeweler whose clients once included\nNapoleon\u2019s wife Jos\u00e9phine, will design the Olympic medals, and Mo\u00ebt Hennessy\nwines will flow in hospitality suites.\n\n\u201cThe partnership will help promote France throughout the world,\u201d Mr. Arnault\ndeclared. As television cameras zoomed in, his eldest son, Antoine, the head of\ncommunications and image for LVMH, uttered what could be a tagline for this huge\ncompany his father has built: \u201cFor a dream, there is no price.\u201d\n\nIt was a moment of public triumph for Mr. Arnault, a sign of how embedded in the\nfabric of France LVMH has become. Over more than 30 years, he has forged LVMH\ninto the world\u2019s largest luxury group and the most valuable company in France,\nwith a presence in 81 countries. His brands \u2014 75 of them \u2014 are the stars of the\nluxury world, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and Dom P\u00e9rignon\nChampagne. It has given him entree to prime ministers and presidents, and\nallowed him to amass a museum-worthy art collection.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Arnault with Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, and Thomas Bach, left, the\npresident of the International Olympic Committee.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for\nThe New York Times\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
