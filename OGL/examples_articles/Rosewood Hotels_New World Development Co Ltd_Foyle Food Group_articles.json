        "link": "https://www.farmersjournal.ie/agribusiness/news/rollercoaster-year-for-factory-prices-801370",
        "content": "No matter what the price of beef is, there is always a big range of prices paid\nbetween factories for the exact same type of animal. Based on average slaughter\nweights, up to \u20ac225 per head more was paid for R3 cows and \u20ac180 per head more\nfor O=3= steers between the highest- and lowest-paying factories that reported\nprices for at least 10 weeks last year. The smallest gap in prices paid was \u20ac71\nfor U=3= heifers.\n\nOne of the frequent warnings we give in presenting this data is to be conscious\nof how external factors may influence the prices paid. These include the likes\nof organic and speciality breeds for which factories pay a premium \u2013 if there\nare substantial numbers of these in a factory\u2019s kill, then the prices they\nreport will be inflated. Similarly, some factories pay an extra bonus to attract\ncattle in a narrow weight range, which others buy off the grid, and deals at\nflat-rate prices will often reflect higher prices for lower grades and lower\nprices for the top grades.\n\nAnother variable that can distort the picture is the effect of a factory killing\na minuscule number of cattle over the year and if these were bought at either an\nexceptionally high or exceptionally low price, they won\u2019t necessarily reflect\nthe mainstream value.\n\nTo address this, an extra column has been added to this year\u2019s league tables\nidentifying the number of weeks in the year for which prices in each particular\ngrade for each factory were reported.\n\nMain findings\n\nThe categories chosen to reflect 2023 are four different grades from steers,\nheifers, young bulls and cows.\n\nThese are U=3=, R=3=, O=3= and P+ 3= giving 16 categories overall and cover the\nvast majority of cattle that are going through Irish factories.\n\nAll the factories that reported for 2022 are still reporting in 2023. Kavanagh\nMeats Enniscorthy started price reporting during 2023 but are excluded from the\nleagues as they don\u2019t have a full year of data. Kildare Chilling is separate\nfrom the Dawn group because that deal was only concluded during the year.\n\nWhile factories outside the main groups claimed several podium positions, some\nof which were based on a small number of cattle reported, several of them\nincluding ABP, Dawn and Kepak occupied positions in top half of the table. (See\nbelow)\n\nFoyle may have had less podium positions than previous years but it was still\nthere or thereabouts and it is one of the factories that pays extra for a narrow\nweight range on steers and heifers.\n\nAshbourne pushed into the top three for O=3= steers and was a consistent buyer\nas it reported for 52 weeks in that category. It was second for P+3= young bulls\nthough with a small sample size.\n\nMoyvalley claimed a first and second place in P+3= and O=3= young bulls, while\nEurofarm was second for R=3= young bulls with Foyle top for the U=3= grade.\nLiffey claimed a third place finish in the P+3= young bull category.\n\nCows\n\nWhen it comes to cows, the top positions are dominated by factories outside the\nmain groups. C&J Meats is widely known as a strong buyer of top-quality cows and\nthis is reflected in the table where it occupies the top position for U=3= and\nR=3= cows and a second place for O=3= cows.\n\nThese are the best-quality suckler-bred cows and C&J reported on these for 46\nand 52 weeks for the U and R grading cows, respectively, in 2023.\n\nTraditional Meat Company took top position for the O=3= and P+3= cows, reporting\non 50 and 25 weeks, respectively, and a second place for the R=3= grade based on\n51 weeks reporting.\n\nLiffey is also a strong cow buyer and had two third places, with Dawn\nBallyhaunis and ABP Nenagh claiming one each.\n\nGroup performance\n\nABP has the edge on U=3= and R=3= steers and heifers though it is pipped by Dawn\nfor the O=3= grade, who are also top for the P+3= grade followed by Kepak with\nABP back in third.\n\nThe top positions are divided between the big three for young bulls but when it\ncomes to cows, when the factories outside the main groups are taken together,\nthey are the top-payers in all categories apart from P+3= grade. There were some\nexcellent cow prices paid in 2023 and this merits further analysis.\n\nFactory margins\n\nIrish beef processing is privately owned and there are no accounts published\nwith the exception of Foyle and C&J Meats whose businesses operate both sides of\nthe border and in the case of Foyle it has two abattoirs in Britain as well.\n\nDunbia, which is the UK division of Dawn Meats also publishes accounts and while\nthis is outside the Republic of Ireland, between them they will give an\nindication of the financial performance. As well as being a very limited sample,\nwe also have to note that in these cases accounts are for the 2022 financial\nyear.\n\n\n\nSuckler cows and calves.\n\n\n\nC&J has a factory outside Lifford in Co Donegal, a cutting plant in Co Armagh\nand is a stakeholder in an abattoir in Co Antrim. In the year to 30 November\n2022, it had a turnover of \u00a369.1m (\u20ac80.3m), up from \u00a358.9m (\u20ac68.5m) in 2021.\n\nOperating profit for the year was \u00a3727,025 (\u20ac845,377) and after interest and\ntaxation, profit for the year was \u00a3490,692 (\u20ac570,572). The breakdown of sales is\n\u00a337m (\u20ac43m) to the UK with \u00a332m (\u20ac37m) to Europe.\n\nDunbia, the UK division of Dawn Meats since 2020, also continues to publish\nannual accounts. It is headquartered in Dungannon Co Tyrone, where it has a beef\nand sheep abattoir, cutting plant and retail packing unit. Across the UK, it has\n13 locations and for 2022 posted a \u00a31.37bn (\u20ac1.59bn) turnover with an operating\nprofit of \u00a312.79m (\u20ac14.87m).\n\nThe Foyle Food Group has an abattoir and cutting plant located in Cargins, Co\nDonegal, and two in Northern Ireland at Lisahally, Co Derry, and Omagh, Co\nTyrone. It also has two factories in Britain. Turnover at the Foyle Food Group\nHoldings Ltd increased to \u00a3482m (\u20ac560.4m) in 2022, up from \u00a3410m (\u20ac476.7m) in\n2021 with operating profit at \u00a312.9m (\u20ac15m) compared with \u00a314.6m (\u20ac17m) the\nprevious year and net profits were \u00a39.3m (\u20ac10.8m), down from \u00a310.7m (\u20ac12.4m) in\n2021.\n\nNumbers useful for guidance and an indication of trends\n\nLooking at factory profit figures where they exist, profits that are stated in\nmultiple millions look spectacular. There is do doubt that a well-run beef\nprocessing business can be extremely profitable but when the numbers are\nanalysed in these examples, we can see that profit margins are running between\njust under 1% and 2.7%.\n\nQuestion\n\nThe other question that remains unanswered is how representative are these\nnumbers for beef processing in the Republic of Ireland?\n\nAll of the Dunbia business is UK-based as is the largest percentage of the Foyle\nbusiness and the C&J business has a significant contribution from northern\ncattle, as well as from its Donegal factory. As with the factory league tables\nfor cattle prices, these numbers are useful for guidance and an indication of\ntrends.",

        "content": "The suckler herd involved in the trial\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 in Co. Tyrone has partnered with a\nNorwegian-based agri-tech company in a new hill-farm grazing trial.\n\nThe trial is set to examine how \u2018virtual fencing\u2019 can optimise the grazing\nmanagement of a suckler herd in a hill farm setting.\n\nSpeaking to Agriland, Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke explained what the\nresearch hopes to achieve.\n\nHe explained that the project is being initially trialled on 26 cows and a\nbreeding bull. No collars are placed on the calves.\n\nThe trial will examine how effective the virtual fencing is in the hill\nlandscape where phone signal is poor.\n\nInitial indications are showing the virtual fence is effective despite the low\nsignal in the region and the farm has plans to expand the project to more cattle\nin the near future.\n\nClarke added that the \u2018virtual fence\u2019 is essentially a collar that is placed on\nthe livestock. A phone app shows the farmer where the cattle are located.\n\nL-r: Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke, Ann Elinor Aasen from Monel, Wayne\nAcheson from Foyle Food Group and Christoffer Grindheim from Monel\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here in the office and if I want to give the cattle grazing on the\nhill a fresh area to graze, I can use the technology to create a bigger grazing\nzone for the cattle to make their way into.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s free entry for the cattle to get into the zone but once they try to go\n> out of the zone they hear a noise and they get that noise three times and then\n> it goes to a shock.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a solar panel on the collars. They\u2019re charged up at the start of the\nyear and the solar panel will keep them charged for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cThe phone app will tell you what each collar battery is and if you have a\ncollar not working or the battery\u2019s not charging, it will let you know,\u201d he\noutlined.\n\nThe collars were fitted last week and have been \u201cworking well\u201d on the herd so\nfar, according to the Foyle representative.\n\nWilson Marshall from the Foyle Food Group agri-team (left) pictured with Monil\nstaff\n\nClarke said: \u201cThere\u2019s two reasons we wanted to trial the collars. Firstly, we\nwant to better manage the grazing of the cattle on the hill.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the cattle to graze areas of the hill where they wouldn\u2019t\nnormally go as a group.\n\n> \u201cSecondly, whenever we\u2019re serving cows with a bull on the hill, sometimes the\n> cows could be on one end of the hill and the bull could be on the other. The\n> cow could be cycling and the bull would never see her within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the virtual fencing is to keep the livestock batched and moved\nacross the hill. We hope to be able to basically rotationally graze the hill.\nThat\u2019s what were trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe fence can be managed from a smartphone\n\nThe Norwegian-based company involved in the trial with Foyle is \u2018Monil\u2019.\n\nAccording to their website, Monil is \u201ca startup [business] challenging\ntraditional fences with our innovative virtual fencing technology, allowing\nanimals to roam freely while giving farmers complete control over their herd\u2019s\nlocation and well-being\u201d.\n\n\nFOYLE FARM\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 is located in Co. Tyrone and the\noverall farming operation encompasses 1,100ac of land. 570ac of this is\nmountain-type ground, 250ac is lowland grazing and the rest is lowland silage\nground.\n\nThe farm is continuously conducting research and trials with the aim of\nproviding practical and up-to-date information to Foyle\u2019s beef suppliers on ways\nto further improve the economic and environmental sustainability of their farms.\n\nSome of the areas on which the farm is currently conducting research includes\nbest practice on grassland management, soil health, animal nutrition, and\nbedding for livestock.\n\nMore information on the farm can be found here.",

        "title": "Emerging Market Economy: Definition, How It Works, and Examples ",
        "link": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp",
        "content": "WHAT IS AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY?\n\nAn emerging market economy is the economy of a developing nation that's becoming\nmore engaged with global markets as it grows. Countries classified as emerging\nmarket economies are those with some but not all of the characteristics of a\ndeveloped market.\n\nCharacteristics of developed markets can include strong economic growth, high\nper capita income, liquid equity and debt markets, accessibility by foreign\ninvestors, and a dependable regulatory system.\n\nIt typically becomes more integrated with the global economy as an emerging\nmarket economy develops. It can have increased liquidity in local debt and\nequity markets, increased trade volume, and foreign direct investment. It can\ndevelop modern financial and regulatory institutions. Some notable emerging\nmarket economies include India, Mexico, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and\nBrazil.\n\nAn emerging market economy is transitioning from a low-income, less developed,\noften pre-industrial economy toward a modern, industrial economy with a higher\nstandard of living.\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * An emerging market economy is one that's transitioning into a developed\n   economy.\n * Emerging market economies typically feature a unified currency, stock market,\n   and banking system. They're in the process of industrializing.\n * Emerging market economies can offer greater returns to investors due to their\n   rapid growth.\n * They also offer greater exposure to some inherent risks due to their status.\n * Emerging markets typically adopt reforms that are seen in developed markets\n   over time.\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY\n\nInvestors seek emerging markets for the prospect of high returns because these\nmarkets often experience faster economic growth as measured by gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Higher returns usually come with much greater risk, however.\n\n\nRISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS\n\nRisks can include political instability, domestic infrastructure problems,\ncurrency volatility, and illiquid equity because many large companies may still\nbe state-run or private. Local stock exchanges might not offer liquid markets to\noutside investors.\n\nEmerging markets generally don't have highly developed market and regulatory\ninstitutions like those found in developed nations. Market efficiency and strict\nstandards in accounting and securities regulation are generally not on par with\nadvanced economies such as those of the United States, Europe, and Japan.\n\n\nSIGNS OF PROGRESS\n\nEmerging markets typically have a physical financial infrastructure, including\nbanks, a stock exchange, and a unified currency. A key aspect of emerging market\neconomies is that they adopt reforms and institutions like those of modern\ndeveloped countries over time. This promotes economic growth.\n\nEmerging market economies tend to move away from activities that are focused on\nagricultural and resource extraction toward industrial and manufacturing\nactivities instead. Their governments usually pursue deliberate industrial and\ntrade strategies to encourage economic growth and industrialization. These\nstrategies include export-led growth and import-substituting industrialization.\n\nExport-led growth is more typical of economies that are considered emerging\nbecause it promotes more engagement and trade with the global economy. Emerging\nmarket countries also often pursue domestic programs such as investing in\neducational systems, building physical infrastructure, and enacting legal\nreforms to secure investors' property rights.\n\n\nFRONTIER MARKETS\n\nFrontier markets are usually smaller than emerging markets with lower per capita\nincome, less market liquidity, and less industrialization. They offer attractive\ninvestment opportunities but frontier markets are considered riskier for\ninvestors than emerging markets.\n\n\nHOW EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES ARE CLASSIFIED\n\nEmerging market economies are classified in various ways. Levels of income,\nquality of financial systems, and growth rates are all popular criteria but the\nexact list of emerging market economies can vary depending on who you ask.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) classifies 20 countries as emerging\nmarkets. Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) classifies 24 countries as\nemerging markets. Standard and Poor's (S&P), FTSE Russell, and Dow Jones also\nvary slightly in their classification of countries as emerging markets.\n\nA country can be removed from the list by either upgrading it to developed\nnation status or downgrading it to a frontier nation at any of these\ninstitutions' discretion. Developed nations may likewise be downgraded to an\nemerging market as was the case with Greece. Frontier markets such as Qatar and\nArgentina may be upgraded to emerging markets.\n\n\nWHAT'S AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY?\n\nAn emerging market economy is generally considered an economy that's\ntransitioning into a developed market economy. It has rapid GDP growth, growing\nper capita income, increasing debt and equity markets liquidity, and an\nestablished financial system infrastructure.\n\n\nWHAT COUNTRIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EMERGING MARKETS?\n\nClassifications differ but the so-called BRICS countries represent five emerging\nmarkets with major economic growth and opportunities for investment: Brazil,\nRussia, India, China, and South Africa. The GDPs of these countries have\nincreased steadily from 2000 through 2023. Data for 2024 isn't yet available.\n\nThat trend is expected to continue through the years ahead.\n\n\nDO EMERGING MARKETS MAKE GOOD INVESTMENTS?\n\nThey can make good investments due to their propensity for rapid GDP growth\ncompared to more mature markets but investing in emerging markets can be risky\ndue to potential political instability, lack of dependable information, currency\nfluctuations, lower liquidity, and investment volatility.\n\nInvestors should carefully weigh potential risks and rewards before making any\ninvestment.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nCountries that are classified as emerging market economies are those with\neconomies that are transitioning into being developed. They have a unified\ncurrency, stock market, and banking system, and they're in the process of\nindustrializing.\n\nEmerging market economies can be attractive to investors due to their rapid\ngrowth and greater returns but they also involve greater exposure and risk due\nto political instability or currency fluctuation.",
        "summary": "An emerging market economy is transitioning from a low-income, less developed, pre-industrial economy toward a modern, industrial economy. It typically becomes more integrated with the global economy as it develops. It can have increased liquidity in local debt and equity markets, increased trade volume, and foreign direct investment.",

        "content": "UNDERSTANDING THE DIVIDEND DYNAMICS OF NWWDF\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd () recently announced a of $0.2 per share, payable\non 2024-04-18, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-03-20. As investors look\nforward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's\ndividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's\ndelve into New World Development Co Ltd's dividend performance and assess its\nsustainability.\n\n\nWHAT DOES NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD DO?\n\n * \n * \n\n * This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years\n\n * How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nNew World Development, or NWD, is the listed property arm of Chow Tai Fook,\nowned by the Cheng family. Chow Tai Fook owns a 45% stake in NWD, which mainly\nengages in residential property development and investment properties of retail\nmalls and offices in Hong Kong and mainland China. NWD also develops high-end\nhotels across Hong Kong, mainland China, and in Southeast Asia. Additionally,\nNWD holds a 75% interest in New World Department Store China, which operates 24\ndepartment stores in mainland China.\n\n\n\n\nA GLIMPSE AT NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND HISTORY\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd has maintained a consistent record since 1999.\nDividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart\nshowing annual for tracking historical trends.\n\n\nBREAKING DOWN NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND YIELD AND GROWTH\n\nAs of today, New World Development Co Ltd currently has a 12-month of 8.09% and\na 12-month of 4.26%. This suggests an expectation of decreased dividend payments\nover the next 12 months.\n\nOver the past three years, New World Development Co Ltd's annual was -1.30%.\nExtended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 1.20% per year. And over\nthe past decade, New World Development Co Ltd's annual dividends per share\ngrowth rate stands at 3.10%.\n\nBased on New World Development Co Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth\nrate, the of New World Development Co Ltd stock as of today is approximately\n8.59%.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY QUESTION: PAYOUT RATIO AND PROFITABILITY\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the\ncompany's payout ratio. The provides insights into the portion of earnings the\ncompany distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company\nretains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of\nfunds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, New World\nDevelopment Co Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 2.77, which may suggest that the\ncompany's dividend may not be sustainable.\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd's , offers an understanding of the company's\nearnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks New World Development Co\nLtd's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability\nprospects. The company has reported positive for each year over the past decade,\nfurther solidifying its high profitability.\n\n\nGROWTH METRICS: THE FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth\nmetrics. New World Development Co Ltd's of 7 out of 10 suggests that the\ncompany's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and New World Development Co Ltd's ,\ncombined with the , indicates a strong revenue model. New World Development Co\nLtd's revenue has increased by approximately 17.90% per year on average, a rate\nthat outperforms approximately 75.09% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical\ncomponent for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years,\nNew World Development Co Ltd's earnings increased by approximately 17.30% per\nyear on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 68.78% of global\ncompetitors.\n\nLastly, the company's of -35.80%, which outperforms approximately 4.42% of\nglobal competitors, presents a mixed picture but does not overshadow the\ncompany's overall strong performance.\n\n\nENGAGING CONCLUSION: EVALUATING NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND\nPROSPECTS\n\nIn conclusion, New World Development Co Ltd's upcoming dividend payment, along\nwith its historical dividend performance, presents an interesting case for\ninvestors. While the dividend growth rate and high yield on cost are attractive,\nthe low payout ratio raises questions about the dividend's sustainability.\nHowever, the company's solid profitability and positive growth metrics provide\nconfidence in its ability to sustain dividends. Investors should weigh these\nfactors carefully and consider New World Development Co Ltd's overall financial\nhealth when making investment decisions. Will the company continue to reward\nshareholders with consistent dividend payments? Only time will tell.\n\nGuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the .\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights\nand is not tailored financial advice.

        "link": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/mckinseys-private-markets-annual-review",
        "content": "AT A GLANCE\n\n\nMACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES CONTINUED\n\nIf 2022 was a tale of two halves, with robust fundraising and deal activity in\nthe first six months followed by a slowdown in the second half, then 2023 might\nbe considered a tale of one whole. Macroeconomic headwinds persisted throughout\nthe year, with rising financing costs, and an uncertain growth outlook taking a\ntoll on private markets. Full-year fundraising continued to decline from 2021\u2019s\nlofty peak, weighed down by the \u201cdenominator effect\u201d that persisted in part due\nto a less active deal market. Managers largely held onto assets to avoid selling\nin a lower-multiple environment, fueling an activity-dampening cycle in which\ndistribution-starved limited partners (LPs) reined in new commitments.\n\nPerformance in most private asset classes remained below historical averages for\na second consecutive year. Decade-long tailwinds from low and falling interest\nrates and consistently expanding multiples seem to be things of the past. As\nprivate market managers look to boost performance in this new era of investing,\na deeper focus on revenue growth and margin expansion will be needed now more\nthan ever.\n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL FUNDRAISING CONTRACTED\n\nFundraising fell 22 percent across private market asset classes globally to just\nover $1 trillion, as of year-end reported data\u2014the lowest total since 2017.\nFundraising in North America, a rare bright spot in 2022, declined in line with\nglobal totals, while in Europe, fundraising proved most resilient, falling just\n3 percent. In Asia, fundraising fell precipitously and now sits 72 percent below\nthe region\u2019s 2018 peak.\n\nDespite difficult fundraising conditions, headwinds did not affect all\nstrategies or managers equally. Private equity (PE) buyout strategies posted\ntheir best fundraising year ever, and larger managers and vehicles also fared\nwell, continuing the prior year\u2019s trend toward greater fundraising\nconcentration.\n\n\nTHE NUMERATOR EFFECT PERSISTED\n\nDespite a marked recovery in the denominator\u2014the 1,000 largest US retirement\nfunds grew 7 percent in the year ending September 2023, after falling 14 percent\nthe prior year, for example1\u2014many LPs remain overexposed to private markets\nrelative to their target allocations. LPs started 2023 overweight: according to\nanalysis from CEM Benchmarking, average allocations across PE, infrastructure,\nand real estate were at or above target allocations as of the beginning of the\nyear. And the numerator grew throughout the year, as a lack of exits and\nrebounding valuations drove net asset values (NAVs) higher. While not all LPs\nstrictly follow asset allocation targets, our analysis in partnership with\nglobal private markets firm StepStone Group suggests that an overallocation of\njust one percentage point can reduce planned commitments by as much as 10 to 12\npercent per year for five years or more.\n\nDespite these headwinds, recent surveys indicate that LPs remain broadly\ncommitted to private markets. In fact, the majority plan to maintain or increase\nallocations over the medium to long term.\n\n\nINVESTORS FLED TO KNOWN NAMES AND LARGER FUNDS\n\nFundraising concentration reached its highest level in over a decade, as\ninvestors continued to shift new commitments in favor of the largest fund\nmanagers. The 25 most successful fundraisers collected 41 percent of aggregate\ncommitments to closed-end funds (with the top five managers accounting for\nnearly half that total). Closed-end fundraising totals may understate the extent\nof concentration in the industry overall, as the largest managers also tend to\nbe more successful in raising non-institutional capital.\n\nWhile the largest funds grew even larger\u2014the largest vehicles on record were\nraised in buyout, real estate, infrastructure, and private debt in 2023\u2014smaller\nand newer funds struggled. Fewer than 1,700 funds of less than $1 billion were\nclosed during the year, half as many as closed in 2022 and the fewest of any\nyear since 2012. New manager formation also fell to the lowest level since 2012,\nwith just 651 new firms launched in 2023.\n\nWhether recent fundraising concentration and a spate of M&A activity signals the\nbeginning of oft-rumored consolidation in the private markets remains uncertain,\nas a similar pattern developed in each of the last two fundraising downturns\nbefore giving way to renewed entrepreneurialism among general partners (GPs) and\ncommitment diversification among LPs. Compared with how things played out in the\nlast two downturns, perhaps this movie really is different, or perhaps we\u2019re\nwatching a trilogy reusing a familiar plotline.\n\n\nDRY POWDER INVENTORY SPIKED (AGAIN)\n\nPrivate markets assets under management totaled $13.1 trillion as of June 30,\n2023, and have grown nearly 20 percent per annum since 2018. Dry powder\nreserves\u2014the amount of capital committed but not yet deployed\u2014increased to $3.7\ntrillion, marking the ninth consecutive year of growth. Dry powder inventory\u2014the\namount of capital available to GPs expressed as a multiple of annual\ndeployment\u2014increased for the second consecutive year in PE, as new commitments\ncontinued to outpace deal activity. Inventory sat at 1.6 years in 2023, up\nmarkedly from the 0.9 years recorded at the end of 2021 but still within the\nhistorical range. NAV grew as well, largely driven by the reluctance of managers\nto exit positions and crystallize returns in a depressed multiple environment.\n\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY STRATEGIES DIVERGED\n\nBuyout and venture capital, the two largest PE sub-asset classes, charted wildly\ndifferent courses over the past 18 months. Buyout notched its highest\nfundraising year ever in 2023, and its performance improved, with funds posting\na (still paltry) 5 percent net internal rate of return through September 30. And\nalthough buyout deal volumes declined by 19 percent, 2023 was still the\nthird-most-active year on record. In contrast, venture capital (VC) fundraising\ndeclined by nearly 60 percent, equaling its lowest total since 2015, and deal\nvolume fell by 36 percent to the lowest level since 2019. VC funds returned \u20133\npercent through September, posting negative returns for seven consecutive\nquarters. VC was the fastest-growing\u2014as well as the highest-performing\u2014PE\nstrategy by a significant margin from 2010 to 2022, but investors appear to be\nreevaluating their approach in the current environment.\n\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY ENTRY MULTIPLES CONTRACTED\n\nPE buyout entry multiples declined by roughly one turn from 11.9 to 11.0 times\nEBITDA, slightly outpacing the decline in public market multiples (down from\n12.1 to 11.3 times EBITDA), through the first nine months of 2023. For nearly a\ndecade leading up to 2022, managers consistently sold assets into a\nhigher-multiple environment than that in which they had bought those assets,\nproviding a substantial performance tailwind for the industry. Nowhere has this\nbeen truer than in technology. After experiencing more than eight turns of\nmultiple expansion from 2009 to 2021 (the most of any sector), technology\nmultiples have declined by nearly three turns in the past two years, 50 percent\nmore than in any other sector. Overall, roughly two-thirds of the total return\nfor buyout deals that were entered in 2010 or later and exited in 2021 or before\ncan be attributed to market multiple expansion and leverage. Now, with falling\nmultiples and higher financing costs, revenue growth and margin expansion are\ntaking center stage for GPs.\n\n\nREAL ESTATE RECEDED\n\nDemand uncertainty, slowing rent growth, and elevated financing costs drove cap\nrates higher and made price discovery challenging, all of which weighed on deal\nvolume, fundraising, and investment performance. Global closed-end fundraising\ndeclined 34 percent year over year, and funds returned \u22124 percent in the first\nnine months of the year, losing money for the first time since the 2007\u201308\nglobal financial crisis. Capital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies\nas investors sought liquidity via redemptions in open-end vehicles, from which\nnet outflows reached their highest level in at least two decades. Opportunistic\nstrategies benefited from this shift, with investors focusing on capital\nappreciation over income generation in a market where alternative sources of\nyield have grown more attractive. Rising interest rates widened bid\u2013ask spreads\nand impaired deal volume across food groups, including in what were formerly hot\nsectors: multifamily and industrial.\n\n\nPRIVATE DEBT PAYS DIVIDENDS\n\nDebt again proved to be the most resilient private asset class against a\nturbulent market backdrop. Fundraising declined just 13 percent, largely driven\nby lower commitments to direct lending strategies, for which a slower PE deal\nenvironment has made capital deployment challenging. The asset class also posted\nthe highest returns among all private asset classes through September 30. Many\nprivate debt securities are tied to floating rates, which enhance returns in a\nrising-rate environment. Thus far, managers appear to have successfully\nnavigated the rising incidence of default and distress exhibited across the\nbroader leveraged-lending market. Although direct lending deal volume declined\nfrom 2022, private lenders financed an all-time high 59 percent of leveraged\nbuyout transactions last year and are now expanding into additional strategies\nto drive the next era of growth.\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE TOOK A DETOUR\n\nAfter several years of robust growth and strong performance, infrastructure and\nnatural resources fundraising declined by 53 percent to the lowest total since\n2013. Supply-side timing is partially to blame: five of the seven largest\ninfrastructure managers closed a flagship vehicle in 2021 or 2022, and none of\nthose five held a final close last year. As in real estate, investors shied away\nfrom core and core-plus investments in a higher-yield environment. Yet there are\nreasons to believe infrastructure\u2019s growth will bounce back. Limited partners\n(LPs) surveyed by McKinsey remain bullish on their deployment to the asset\nclass, and at least a dozen vehicles targeting more than $10 billion were\nactively fundraising as of the end of 2023. Multiple recent acquisitions of\nlarge infrastructure GPs by global multi-asset-class managers also indicate\nmarketwide conviction in the asset class\u2019s potential.\n\n\nPRIVATE MARKETS STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON DIVERSITY\n\nPrivate markets firms are slowly improving their representation of females (up\ntwo percentage points over the prior year) and ethnic and racial minorities (up\none percentage point). On some diversity metrics, including entry-level\nrepresentation of women, private markets now compare favorably with corporate\nAmerica. Yet broad-based parity remains elusive and too slow in the making.\nEthnic, racial, and gender imbalances are particularly stark across more\ninfluential investing roles and senior positions. In fact, McKinsey\u2019s\nresearch\u00a0reveals that at the current pace, it would take several decades for\nprivate markets firms to reach gender parity at senior levels. Increasing\nrepresentation across all levels will require managers to take fresh approaches\nto hiring, retention, and promotion.\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GENERATING EXCITEMENT\n\nThe transformative potential of generative AI was perhaps 2023\u2019s hottest topic\n(beyond Taylor Swift). Private markets players are excited about the potential\nfor the technology to optimize their approach to thesis generation, deal\nsourcing, investment due diligence, and portfolio performance, among other\nareas. While the technology is still nascent and few GPs can boast scaled\nimplementations, pilot programs are already in flight across the industry,\nparticularly within portfolio companies. Adoption seems nearly certain to\naccelerate throughout 2024.\n\nIf private markets investors entered 2023 hoping for a return to the heady days\nof 2021, they likely left the year disappointed. Many of the headwinds that\nemerged in the latter half of 2022 persisted throughout the year, pressuring\nfundraising, dealmaking, and performance. Inflation moderated somewhat over the\ncourse of the year but remained stubbornly elevated by recent historical\nstandards. Interest rates started high and rose higher, increasing the cost of\nfinancing. A reinvigorated public equity market recovered most of 2022\u2019s losses\nbut did little to resolve the valuation uncertainty private market investors\nhave faced for the past 18 months.\n\nWithin private markets, the denominator effect remained in play, despite the\npublic market recovery, as the numerator continued to expand. An\nactivity-dampening cycle emerged: higher cost of capital and lower multiples\nlimited the ability or willingness of general partners (GPs) to exit positions;\nfewer exits, coupled with continuing capital calls, pushed LP allocations\nhigher, thereby limiting their ability or willingness to make new commitments.\nThese conditions weighed on managers\u2019 ability to fundraise. Based on data\nreported as of year-end 2023, private markets fundraising fell 22 percent from\nthe prior year to just over $1 trillion, the largest such drop since 2009\n(Exhibit 1).\n\nThe impact of the fundraising environment was not felt equally among GPs.\nContinuing a trend that emerged in 2022, and consistent with prior downturns in\nfundraising, LPs favored larger vehicles and the scaled GPs that typically\nmanage them. Smaller and newer managers struggled, and the number of sub\u2013$1\nbillion vehicles and new firm launches each declined to its lowest level in more\nthan a decade.\n\nDespite the decline in fundraising, private markets assets under management\n(AUM) continued to grow, increasing 12 percent to $13.1 trillion as of June 30,\n2023. 2023 fundraising was still the sixth-highest annual haul on record,\npushing dry powder higher, while the slowdown in deal making limited\ndistributions.\n\nInvestment performance across private market asset classes fell short of\nhistorical averages. Private equity (PE) got back in the black but generated the\nlowest annual performance in the past 15 years, excluding 2022. Closed-end real\nestate produced negative returns for the first time since 2009, as\ncapitalization (cap) rates expanded across sectors and rent growth dissipated in\nformerly hot sectors, including multifamily and industrial. The performance of\ninfrastructure funds was less than half of its long-term average and even\nfurther below the double-digit returns generated in 2021 and 2022. Private debt\nwas the standout performer (if there was one), outperforming all other private\nasset classes and illustrating the asset class\u2019s countercyclical appeal.\n\n\n\nHigher financing costs, lower multiples, and an uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment created a challenging backdrop for private equity managers in 2023.\nFundraising declined for the second year in a row, falling 15 percent to $649\nbillion, as LPs grappled with the denominator effect and a slowdown in\ndistributions. Managers were on the fundraising trail longer to raise this\ncapital: funds that closed in 2023 were open for a record-high average of 20.1\nmonths, notably longer than 18.7 months in 2022 and 14.1 months in 2018. VC and\ngrowth equity strategies led the decline, dropping to their lowest level of\ncumulative capital raised since 2015. Fundraising in Asia fell for the fourth\nyear of the last five, with the greatest decline in China.\n\nDespite the difficult fundraising context, a subset of strategies and managers\nprevailed. Buyout managers collectively had their best fundraising year on\nrecord, raising more than $400 billion. Fundraising in Europe surged by more\nthan 50 percent, resulting in the region\u2019s biggest haul ever. The largest\nmanagers raised an outsized share of the total for a second consecutive year,\nmaking 2023 the most concentrated fundraising year of the last decade (Exhibit\n2).\n\nDespite the drop in aggregate fundraising, PE assets under management increased\n8 percent to $8.2 trillion. Only a small part of this growth was performance\ndriven: PE funds produced a net IRR of just 2.5 percent through September 30,\n2023. Buyouts and growth equity generated positive returns, while VC lost money.\nPE performance, dating back to the beginning of 2022, remains negative,\nhighlighting the difficulty of generating attractive investment returns in a\nhigher interest rate and lower multiple environment. As PE managers devise value\ncreation strategies to improve performance, their focus includes ensuring\noperating efficiency and profitability of their portfolio companies.\n\nDeal activity volume and count fell sharply, by 21 percent and 24 percent,\nrespectively, which continued the slower pace set in the second half of 2022.\nSponsors largely opted to hold assets longer rather than lock in underwhelming\nreturns. While higher financing costs and valuation mismatches weighed on\noverall deal activity, certain types of M&A gained share. Add-on deals, for\nexample, accounted for a record 46 percent of total buyout deal volume last\nyear.\n\n\n\nFor real estate, 2023 was a year of transition, characterized by a litany of new\nand familiar challenges. Pandemic-driven demand issues continued, while elevated\nfinancing costs, expanding cap rates, and valuation uncertainty weighed on\ncommercial real estate deal volumes, fundraising, and investment performance.\n\nManagers faced one of the toughest fundraising environments in many years.\nGlobal closed-end fundraising declined 34 percent to $125 billion. While\nfundraising challenges were widespread, they were not ubiquitous across\nstrategies. Dollars continued to shift to large, multi-asset class platforms,\nwith the top five managers accounting for 37 percent of aggregate closed-end\nreal estate fundraising. In April, the largest real estate fund ever raised\nclosed on a record $30 billion.\n\nCapital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies as investors sought\nliquidity through redemptions in open-end vehicles and reduced gross\ncontributions to the lowest level since 2009. Opportunistic strategies benefited\nfrom this shift, as investors turned their attention toward capital appreciation\nover income generation in a market where alternative sources of yield have grown\nmore attractive.\n\nIn the United States, for instance, open-end funds, as represented by the\nNational Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Fund Index\u2014Open-End\nEquity (NFI-OE), recorded $13 billion in net outflows in 2023, reversing the\ntrend of positive net inflows throughout the 2010s. The negative flows mainly\nreflected $9 billion in core outflows, with core-plus funds accounting for the\nremaining outflows, which reversed a 20-year run of net inflows.\n\nAs a result, the NAV in US open-end funds fell roughly 16 percent year over\nyear. Meanwhile, global assets under management in closed-end funds reached a\nnew peak of $1.7 trillion as of June 2023, growing 14 percent between June 2022\nand June 2023.\n\nReal estate underperformed historical averages in 2023, as previously\nhigh-performing multifamily and industrial sectors joined office in producing\nnegative returns caused by slowing demand growth and cap rate expansion.\nClosed-end funds generated a pooled net IRR of \u22123.5 percent in the first nine\nmonths of 2023, losing money for the first time since the global financial\ncrisis. The lone bright spot among major sectors was hospitality, which\u2014thanks\nto a rush of postpandemic travel\u2014returned 10.3 percent in 2023.2 As a whole, the\naverage pooled lifetime net IRRs for closed-end real estate funds from 2011\u201320\nvintages remained around historical levels (9.8 percent).\n\nGlobal deal volume declined 47 percent in 2023 to reach a ten-year low of $650\nbillion, driven by widening bid\u2013ask spreads amid valuation uncertainty and\nhigher costs of financing (Exhibit 3).3 Deal flow in the office sector remained\ndepressed, partly as a result of continued uncertainty in the demand for space\nin a hybrid working world.\n\n\n\nDuring a turbulent year for private markets, private debt was a relative bright\nspot, topping private markets asset classes in terms of fundraising growth, AUM\ngrowth, and performance.\n\nFundraising for private debt declined just 13 percent year over year, nearly ten\npercentage points less than the private markets overall. Despite the decline in\nfundraising, AUM surged 27 percent to $1.7 trillion. And private debt posted the\nhighest investment returns of any private asset class through the first three\nquarters of 2023.\n\nPrivate debt\u2019s risk/return characteristics are well suited to the current\nenvironment. With interest rates at their highest in more than a decade, current\nyields in the asset class have grown more attractive on both an absolute and\nrelative basis, particularly if higher rates sustain and put downward pressure\non equity returns (Exhibit 4). The built-in security derived from debt\u2019s\nprivileged position in the capital structure, moreover, appeals to investors\nthat are wary of market volatility and valuation uncertainty.\n\nDirect lending continued to be the largest strategy in 2023, with fundraising\nfor the mostly-senior-debt strategy accounting for almost half of the asset\nclass\u2019s total haul (despite declining from the previous year). Separately,\nmezzanine debt fundraising hit a new high, thanks to the closings of three of\nthe largest funds ever raised in the strategy.\n\nOver the longer term, growth in private debt has largely been driven by\ninstitutional investors rotating out of traditional fixed income in favor of\nprivate alternatives. Despite this growth in commitments, LPs remain underweight\nin this asset class relative to their targets. In fact, the allocation gap has\nonly grown wider in recent years, a sharp contrast to other private asset\nclasses, for which LPs\u2019 current allocations exceed their targets on average.\nAccording to data from CEM Benchmarking, the private debt allocation gap now\nstands at 1.4 percent, which means that, in aggregate, investors must commit\nhundreds of billions in net new capital to the asset class just to reach current\ntargets.\n\nPrivate debt was not completely immune to the macroeconomic conditions last\nyear, however. Fundraising declined for the second consecutive year and now sits\n23 percent below 2021\u2019s peak. Furthermore, though private lenders took share in\n2023 from other capital sources, overall deal volumes also declined for the\nsecond year in a row. The drop was largely driven by a less active PE deal\nenvironment: private debt is predominantly used to finance PE-backed companies,\nthough managers are increasingly diversifying their origination capabilities to\ninclude a broad new range of companies and asset types.\n\n\n\nFor infrastructure and natural resources fundraising, 2023 was an exceptionally\nchallenging year. Aggregate capital raised declined 53 percent year over year to\n$82 billion, the lowest annual total since 2013. The size of the drop is\nparticularly surprising in light of infrastructure\u2019s recent momentum. The asset\nclass had set fundraising records in four of the previous five years, and\ninfrastructure is often considered an attractive investment in uncertain\nmarkets.\n\nWhile there is little doubt that the broader fundraising headwinds discussed\nelsewhere in this report affected infrastructure and natural resources\nfundraising last year, dynamics specific to the asset class were at play as\nwell. One issue was supply-side timing: nine of the ten largest infrastructure\nGPs did not close a flagship fund in 2023. Second was the migration of investor\ndollars away from core and core-plus investments, which have historically\naccounted for the bulk of infrastructure fundraising, in a higher rate\nenvironment.\n\nThe asset class had some notable bright spots last year. Fundraising for\nhigher-returning opportunistic strategies more than doubled the prior year\u2019s\ntotal (Exhibit 5). AUM grew 18 percent, reaching a new high of $1.5 trillion.\nInfrastructure funds returned a net IRR of 3.4 percent in 2023; this was below\nhistorical averages but still the second-best return among private asset\nclasses. And as was the case in other asset classes, investors concentrated\ncommitments in larger funds and managers in 2023, including in the largest\ninfrastructure fund ever raised.\n\nThe outlook for the asset class, moreover, remains positive. Funds targeting a\nrecord amount of capital were in the market at year-end, providing a robust\nfoundation for fundraising in 2024 and 2025. A recent spate of infrastructure GP\nacquisitions signal multi-asset managers\u2019 long-term conviction in the asset\nclass, despite short-term headwinds. Global megatrends like decarbonization and\ndigitization, as well as revolutions in energy and mobility, have spurred new\ninfrastructure investment opportunities around the world, particularly for\nvalue-oriented investors that are willing to take on more risk.\n\n\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become an important part of the\nfundraising, talent, and investing landscape for private market participants.\nEncouragingly, incremental progress has been made in recent years, including\nmore diverse talent being brought to entry-level positions, investing roles, and\ninvestment committees. The scope of DEI metrics provided to institutional\ninvestors during fundraising has also increased in recent years: more than half\nof PE firms now provide data across investing teams, portfolio company boards,\nand portfolio company management (versus investment team data only).4\n\nIn 2023, McKinsey surveyed 66 global private markets firms that collectively\nemploy more than 60,000 people for the second annual State of diversity in\nglobal private markets report.5 The research offers insight into the\nrepresentation of women and ethnic and racial minorities in private investing as\nof year-end 2022. In this chapter, we discuss where the numbers stand and how\nfirms can bring a more diverse set of perspectives to the table.\n\nThe statistics indicate signs of modest advancement. Overall representation of\nwomen in private markets increased two percentage points to 35 percent, and\nethnic and racial minorities increased one percentage point to 30 percent\n(Exhibit 6). Entry-level positions have nearly reached gender parity, with\nfemale representation at 48 percent. The share of women holding C-suite roles\nglobally increased 3 percentage points, while the share of people from ethnic\nand racial minorities in investment committees increased 9 percentage points.\nThere is growing evidence that external hiring is gradually helping close the\ndiversity gap, especially at senior levels. For example, 33 percent of external\nhires at the managing director level were ethnic or racial minorities, higher\nthan their existing representation level (19 percent).\n\nYet, the scope of the challenge remains substantial. Women and minorities\ncontinue to be underrepresented in senior positions and investing roles. They\nalso experience uneven rates of progress due to lower promotion and higher\nattrition rates, particularly at smaller firms. Firms are also navigating an\nincreasingly polarized workplace today, with additional scrutiny and a growing\nnumber of lawsuits against corporate diversity and inclusion programs,\nparticularly in the US, which threatens to impact the industry\u2019s pace of\nprogress.\n\n\n\nFredrik Dahlqvist is a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s Stockholm office; Alastair\nGreen\u00a0is a senior partner in the Washington, DC, office, where Paul Maia and\nAlexandra Nee\u00a0are partners; David Quigley\u00a0is a senior partner in the New York\noffice, where Connor Mangan is an associate partner and Aditya Sanghvi\u00a0is a\nsenior partner; Rahel Schneider is an associate partner in the Bay Area office;\nJohn Spivey is a partner in the Charlotte office; and Brian Vickery\u00a0is a partner\nin the Boston office.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Jonathan Christy, Louis Dufau, Vaibhav Gujral, Graham\nHealy-Day, Laura Johnson, Ryan Luby, Tripp Norton, Alastair Rami, Henri Torbey,\nand Alex Wolkomir for their contributions\n\nThe authors would also like to thank CEM Benchmarking and the StepStone Group\nfor their partnership in this year's report.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis article was edited by Arshiya Khullar, an editor in the Gurugram office.\n\nEXPLORE A CAREER WITH US",

        "content": "A view of the NEV production line of BYD in Rayong, Thailand.\u00a0SUN WEITONG/XINHUA\n\nAt Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor's welding workshop in Rayong, Thailand,\nnumerous robotic arms in operation indicate the level of high-tech in use even\nas Chinese technicians guide local employees through the welding process.\n\nFollowing the successful rollout of its first electric vehicle at its plant in\nThailand this January, the Baoding, Hebei province-based carmaker said that\nmultiple batches of Thai workers have now mastered the production processes of\nits EV products. They have thus become valuable assets for the company, aiding\nits expansion efforts in other Southeast Asian markets.\n\nElsewhere, Beijing-based artificial intelligence services provider Terminus\nGroup is charting a similar course to bring additional value to an overseas\nmarket. Amid the intensified efforts by many Middle Eastern countries to\nleverage the digital economy for sustainable growth, Terminus launched its\ninternational headquarters in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, in February.\n\nIt will not only facilitate Terminus' projects and business expansion\ninitiatives in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and other countries in the\nregion, but also support the group's operations in Singapore, Australia and\nnumerous countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBoth GWM and Terminus are epitomes of a larger trend \u2014 that of Chinese\nenterprises operating in the vast BRI landscape going beyond big-ticket\ninfrastructure projects like dams, highways, railroads, airports and municipal\nengineering works.\n\nAs many parts of the world enter a new phase of development, Chinese companies,\nparticularly those from high-end manufacturing and trade in services, are\nadjusting their strategies to better align with the evolving environment in BRI\neconomies, said Wan Zhe, a researcher at the Belt and Road School of Beijing\nNormal University.\n\nFacing challenges like escalating geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism\nin certain countries, Chinese enterprises are focusing on avoiding risks and\ngenerating revenue through higher-value business ventures that serve the\nchanging landscape better, said Wan.\n\nFor instance, GWM plans to start operations at its new factories in Vietnam,\nIndonesia and Malaysia this year or the next.\n\nSimilarly, Chang'an Automobile Co, a Chongqing-based State-owned automaker, is\nbuilding a factory in Rayong province, Thailand. The first phase of the project\nwill involve an investment of over $240 million and is scheduled to begin\nproduction in 2025.\n\nEmployees work on a battery production line of BYD in Brazil.\u00a0WANG\nTIANCONG/XINHUA\n\nThe new energy vehicles produced will be not only marketed in Thailand but also\nexported to other neighboring ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)\ncountries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and South\nAfrica, said Shen Xinghua, president of Chang'an Automobile's business for\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nShen said that the initial annual production capacity of this plant is 100,000\nunits, which will be gradually expanded to 200,000 units in the next phase.\n\nChen Bin, deputy director of an expert committee at the Beijing-based China\nMachinery Industry Federation, said that South Africa, Hungary, Saudi Arabia,\nIndonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia have all formulated EV-related policies to\nencourage and support the development and growth of the industry.\n\nHighlighting that electrification and intelligence complement each other, Chen\nsaid with growing populations in many countries, particularly in Africa and\nSoutheast Asia, an increasing number of young consumers who prefer smart\ntechnologies are emerging, making these markets more proactive in embracing EVs.\n\nHis observation reflects a trend. China's NEVs are becoming popular in overseas\nmarkets thanks to their quality, driving range and multifunctionality.\n\nSome 519,000 EVs and plug-in hybrids were exported from China between January\nand May, up 13.7 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile\nManufacturers.\n\nChina's continuous efforts to enhance institutional opening-up and secure\nhigh-standard economic and free trade agreements, alongside the swift expansion\nof its tech-intensive green product industries, are anticipated to propel its\ncompanies to strategically invest in new plants, service centers and innovation\nfacilities in markets involved in the BRI, said Yu Jianlong, vice-chairman of\nthe Beijing-headquartered China Council for the Promotion of International\nTrade.\n\nIn addition to automakers such as SAIC Motor, Beijing Automotive Group,\nGuangzhou Automobile Group and BYD, Chinese battery and component manufacturers,\nincluding Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, Gotion High-tech Co Ltd and\nEVE Energy Co Ltd, have invested in BRI economies to supply products to their\ndomestic partners and create jobs for local communities.\n\nRecognizing this trend, Matthias Loebich, partner and leader for international\nbusiness at Bearing-Point, a European management and technology consultancy with\nmore than 10,000 employees across 70 countries and regions, said that China's\nfast-growing EV sector will continue to lead the world's green transition and\ncreate enormous growth opportunities for upstream and downstream industries in\nthe BRI landscape.\n\n\"This is evident in our doubling of Chinese automotive clients seeking\nconsulting support over the past two years,\" said Loebich, noting that Chinese\nautomakers are enhancing their internal capabilities in management, digital\ntransformation and overseas strategies, learning from advanced markets to\nelevate their global presence.\n\nThe company established a dedicated team to help Chinese automakers conduct\nsustainability-related activities in both home and global markets in 2023, in\norder to further enhance their growth strength.\n\nCollectively, such moves have had a positive effect on official data. China's\nnonfinancial outbound direct investment came in at $60.2 billion in the first\nfive months, up 16.3 percent year-on-year, statistics from the Ministry of\nCommerce showed.\n\nChina's cooperation with countries and regions participating in the BRI\ncontinued to show growth momentum as ODI in these economies came in at $12.81\nbillion, up nearly 13 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe value of trade between China and BRI economies was worth 8.31 trillion yuan\n($1.14 trillion) during the January-May period, up 7.2 percent year-on-year,\ndata from the General Administration of Customs showed.\n\nSuch a rise will likely be sustained given certain strategic Chinese corporate\nmoves. For instance, in late June, Chinese train maker CRRC Corp, driven by its\nproduct upgrade and technology accumulation, unveiled seven new energy\nlocomotives in Beijing, to offer the world new solutions for green, low-carbon\ndevelopment in rail transport. These will enrich CRRC Corp's overall product\nofferings. This marked a notable step forward in green transition efforts in\nboth domestic and global markets.\n\nLin Cunzeng, CRRC's vice-president, said the development of this series of new\nenergy locomotives is a concrete step to promote the renewal and upgrade of\noutdated equipment in both home and foreign markets, and advance the green and\nlow-carbon transformation of rail transit equipment.\n\n\"They will contribute to the high-quality growth of the BRI and enrich China's\nexport content,\" said Lin.\n\nThese new locomotives, he said, will drive the demand for diverse new energy\nproducts like power batteries and hydrogen energy power packs. They will,\ntherefore, stimulate the development of upstream industries like basic materials\nand core components, fostering new drivers of economic growth.\n\nThe current reshaping of the global supply chain has generated new avenues for\nChinese companies to match their capabilities with shifting market needs, said\nLyu Yue, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies, part of the\nUniversity of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"Showing strong competitiveness, Chinese companies excel in industries like new\nenergy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic products,\" said Lyu,\nadding this has resulted in increased acceptance and collaboration from many\ncountries involved in the BRI.\n\nAgreed Michael Dyke, CEO of the Riyadh-based New Murabba Development Co, a\nbusiness unit of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Dyke said that the\ntangible growth of the BRI and enhanced Sino-Saudi business relations will\nattract more Chinese companies to expand their market presence in Saudi Arabia.\n\nNew Murabba Development is responsible for building a modern town in Riyadh. Its\ndevelopment spans 19 square kilometers. The project will include 2 million\nsquare meters of floor space featuring retail areas, tourist attractions,\n104,000 residential units, 9,000 hotel rooms and 80 entertainment venues. Its\nfirst phase is scheduled to be completed and operationalized in 2030.\n\nChina Harbour Engineering Co Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered subsidiary of\nState-owned China Communications Construction Co Ltd, will carry out the first\nphase of excavation work for this project.",

Chances are the clothes you're wearing, the smartphone in your\npocket, and the transportation you take to work all have one thing in common:\nthey were likely manufactured by an MNC, as are 90% of American imports.\n\nMultinationals permeate nearly every aspect of our modern lives while wielding a\nstaggering influence politically and economically, with more than a quarter of\nAmerican workers employed by one. The first multinationals were colonial\nenterprises. The East India Company (formed 1600), Dutch East India Company\n(VOC; 1602), and the Hudson Bay Colony (HBC, 1649) stand out as central to\nimperialist histories whose rapaciousness still haunts anyone with even the\nvaguest sense of history. Remarkably, HBC endures, as does its core business\nmodel, sourcing clothing and other materials\u2014while holding massive amounts of\nreal estate\u2014in one part of the world to sell finished goods to Western\nconsumers.\n\nThe MNCs formed more recently have often not equipped themselves much better:\nJust 57 multinationals were responsible for unleashing 80% of global carbon\nemissions between 2016 and 2022. Yet, despite their ubiquity in what we wear and\neven the air we breathe, there is still widespread confusion about what defines\na company as \"multinational.\" Is it simply having offices or factories overseas?\nSelling products internationally? Or is there more to it?\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * A multinational corporation (MNC) has business operations in at least two\n   countries, often with headquarters in one country and subsidiaries,\n   manufacturing plants, and offices in other nations.\n * MNCs have expanded rapidly in recent decades because of falling trade\n   barriers, the search for new markets, expanding global supply chains, and\n   outsourcing operations to lower-cost regions.\n * Multinational corporations can bring benefits like job creation,\n   infrastructure investment, and improved quality of goods in the countries\n   where they operate, but many are known for disreputable tax, environmental,\n   and labor practices.\n * Well-known examples of multinational corporations include Apple Inc. (AAPL),\n   Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), Nestle SA (NSRGY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM),\n   and Coca-Cola Co. (KO).\n\nMultinationals have fundamentally shaped the flow of capital, goods, and\nservices in a world that they helped connect, perhaps more than any military,\nduring the centuries-long process of globalization. Their incredible economic\nclout has also sparked heated debates around their power, labor practices,\nenvironmental impacts, and tax avoidance strategies. In this article, we take\nyou through their history, organizational structures, and complex role in\nglobalization.\n\nInvestopedia / Jessica Olah\n\n\nHOW A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION WORKS\n\nMNCs operate in at least two countries, with significant business activities and\ninvestments spanning across national borders. Their rise can be traced to the\n1600s and colonialism, though the modern corporation took shape with the\nemergence of large-scale industries such as oil, automobiles, and consumer goods\nin the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Companies like Standard Oil, Ford,\nand Coca-Cola were among the forerunners in expanding their operations globally\nwhile amassing revenues on par with entire nations.\n\nLater, the post-World War II era saw their accelerated growth, driven by trade\nliberalization, advances in shipping and other technologies, and the increasing\ninterconnectedness of global markets.\n\nVinci SA, the French multinational construction firm, had the most subsidiaries\nworldwide, at 2,689. In second place is HCA Healthcare, the U.S. pharmaceutical\nand healthcare giant, with 2,447.\n\nBut what are they? These companies take different forms, from giant\nconglomerates with diverse portfolios to specialized firms focusing on specific\nindustries or regions. Here are the main points about their structure:\n\n * Definition: MNCs are often formally defined as business entities with one or\n   more foreign affiliates in which the parent company holds at least a 10%\n   ownership stake. Most foreign affiliates are 100% owned by their parents.\n * Structure: MNCs typically consist of a parent company headquartered in one\n   country, with subsidiaries, branches, or joint ventures in multiple host\n   countries. The parent company maintains strategic control over its global\n   operations, setting overall goals, policies, and standards. Subsidiaries are\n   separate legal entities in the countries where they operate.\n * Governance: MNCs often have centralized management, with the most important\n   decisions made at the headquarters. However, some adopt a more decentralized\n   approach, giving regional or country-specific management teams greater\n   autonomy. MNCs may also have a matrix-like structure, where employees report\n   to both functional (e.g. marketing, finance) and geographic managers (e.g.\n   country or regional heads).\n\nThe foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of multinational corporations\nincreased by over 106 times between 1970 and 2023, from $13 billion to $1.37\ntrillion.\n\nThe specific organizational design of MNCs depends on where they are and their\nindustry. Though the two terms are often used interchangeably, multinational\nenterprises (MNEs) and MNCs are different. MNEs are entities that engage in\nforeign direct investment (FDI) and own or control production or material\ndevelopment firms in more than one country. This is a very broad definition for\na reason: MNEs include corporations, partnerships, state-run enterprises, and\nother types of business structures. MNEs can be private or state-owned and may\noperate in various sectors, such as manufacturing, services, or extractive\nindustries. MNCs are a specific type of MNE that takes the form of a\ncorporation. In sum, while all MNCs are MNEs, not all MNEs are MNCs.\n\nDeveloping an international presence can open up new markets where\nmultinationals can sell goods or produce the same quality of products at lower\ncosts. MNCs can thus reduce prices and increase the purchasing power of\nconsumers worldwide. They may also take advantage of lower tax rates in\ncountries eager for FDI, and critics point to their propensity for developing\nmonopolies where they operate. This can drive up prices, squelch competition,\nand inhibit innovation.\n\nCharacteristics of a Multinational Corporation Characteristic Description\nBenefits Challenges Examples Global Reach Operates and has a significant market\npresence in multiple countries. Access to diverse markets Navigating different\nregulations Coca-Cola, operating in over 200 countries and territories. Diverse\nOperations Engages in a wide range of business activities across different\nindustries and sectors. Diversification of risk and new markets Potential\noverextension Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (SSNLF), involved in electronics,\nconstruction, shipbuilding, and financial services. Intricate Business Structure\nMaintains a complicated business model and organizational structure to manage\nglobal operations. Efficient management of diverse operations Coordination and\ncommunication complexity Proctor & Gamble Co. (PG), which combines global\nbusiness units and selling and market operations. Foreign Direct Investment\nInvests directly in foreign countries, establishing subsidiaries and production\nfacilities. Control over foreign operations High initial investment, political\nrisks Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) has established numerous production plants\nand research centers across the globe.

Brand Recognition\nTypically have strong brand recognition and global marketing strategies. Enables\nMNCs to command premium prices and foster customer loyalty Maintaining a\nconsistent and positive brand image across different cultures and regulatory\nenvironments can be challenging and costly McDonald's Corp. (MCD), with its\niconic golden arches recognized worldwide. International Taxation Pays taxes in\nmultiple countries, navigating different statutory tax rates. Potential tax\nsavings through optimization Complex tax compliance, risk of penalties Starbucks\nCorp. (SBUX) has faced scrutiny controversy for using complex tax structures to\nshift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Financial Reporting Standards Reports\nfinancial information according to International Financial Reporting Standards.\nTransparency, comparability across borders Adhering to different accounting\nstandards Siemens AG (SIEGY), the German conglomerate, must adhere to diverse\nfinancial reporting standards across across jurisdictions.\n\n\nTYPES OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS\n\n * Decentralized corporation: This type of MNC maintains a presence in its home\n   country and has autonomous offices and other facilities globally. Each office\n   manages the local business itself, making its own decisions.\n * Centralized global corporation: A central headquarters is located in the home\n   country. Executive officers and management manage the overseas offices and\n   operations, as well as domestic operations. The subsidiaries must get\n   approval from headquarters for significant activities.\n * International division of a corporation: This is the part of an MNC\n   responsible for all global operations. They can function independently of\n   domestic operations, which can pose problems when overall corporate consensus\n   and action are required.\n * Transnational corporation: A parent-subsidiary structure in which the parent\n   company oversees the operations of subsidiaries in foreign countries and the\n   home country. Subsidiaries can use the parent's assets, such as research and\n   development data. Subsidiaries may be different brands. Though differentiated\n   in the past, the term is now virtually synonymous with MNCs.\n\n\nMULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS\n\nThe post-World War II era saw a significant acceleration in the growth of MNCs,\nfueled by advances in transportation, shipping, communication, and trade\nliberalization. The rise of global brands like Coca-Cola, International Business\nMachines Corporation (IBM), and McDonald's exhibited the growing reach and\ninfluence of MNCs.\n\nThese global entities had the power to shape economies, industries, and\nsocieties across borders, making them a force to be reckoned with in the modern\nworld. For critics, it seemed that as the armies of Europe receded from their\ncolonies, MNCs stepped in to take their place.\n\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MNCS\n\nSpanning continents and with the ability to mobilize resources larger than many\nnations' annual revenues, MNCs can drive economic growth and development for\nmillions. Multinationals have attracted praise for their benefits to economic\ngrowth and criticism for their potential to exert undue influence over so-called\n\"host\" countries\u2014those nations where their subsidiaries set up shop.\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and other economists generally credit MNCs'\npositive contributions to global development. Among the most significant is\ntheir ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), which can inject\nmuch-needed capital, technology, and expertise into an economy.\n\nThe most common method of FDI is when a multinational acquires a local firm, but\nit can include foreign joint ventures, constructing new plants, and reinvesting\nearnings in a foreign subsidiary. Given the natural involvement of MNCs in these\ninvestments, it's an indirect measure of their spread into new markets.\nAccording to the World Bank, total FDI inflows to developing countries were\n$1.37 trillion in 2023.\n\nTypically, economists analyze inflows for specific nations to see if MNCs and\nothers are finding a country a good place to invest. The more FDI coming into a\ncountry, the more jobs it can produce and the more taxes it can collect. FDI\ninflows don't include portfolio investments like buying bonds, stocks, and other\nassets in a foreign country without gaining ownership control.\n\nFor decades, the IMF argued for countries to increase their FDI inflows through\nlower taxes and less regulation (hence shrinking the size of the state), which\nits economists typically couch in the moral language of \"macroeconomic\ndiscipline.\" As such, for much of the post-colonial period, the IMF and other\nmultinational organizations have been pushing developing economies to attract\nMNCs to set up shop there, making FDI the most capital flows into less-developed\ncountries for the decades after decolonization.\n\n\nCRITIQUES OF MNCS\n\nHowever, this push for increased FDI has not been without its critics,\nparticularly those in developing countries. MNC influence has raised complex\nquestions about the role of foreign investment, the distribution of benefits,\nand popular and local sovereignty. Once an MNC moves into an area, it can often\nsideline local industries and then use its monopolistic hold to gain significant\npolitical influence in the country. Then, in moves reminiscent, for some, of the\nflows of capital during the era of state colonialism, the profits might be\nrepatriated by MNCs to their home country, limiting the benefits of FDI for host\ncountries. These issues have led to various responses from host governments,\nincluding protests, restrictions, exclusion, and even expropriation of MNCs.\n\nMeanwhile, it's become clear that many MNCs aren't returning their funds to\nwhere they're headquartered. As a percentage of GDP, the highest FDI inflows\naren't into the U.S. or newly opened markets but tax havens like the Cayman\nIslands, which have no corporate income, capital gains, or payroll taxes.\u00a0This\nmakes it an attractive destination for multinational corporations to park funds\nto minimize their taxes to the countries where that wealth was earned.\n\nCritiques of MNCs tend to fall under the following categories:\n\n * Environmental devastation: MNCs have been accused of prioritizing profits\n   over environmental protection, leading to deforestation, pollution, and\n   unsustainable resource extraction in the pursuit of cheap inputs.\n * Labor exploitation: Critics point to poor working conditions, low wages, and\n   lack of worker rights in many places where MNCs operate, amounting to a race\n   to the bottom in labor standards among the countries competing for FDI\n   inflows.\n * Tax avoidance: Countries worldwide lose billions in tax revenues due to\n   aggressive tax planning strategies MNCs use to shift profits to low-tax\n   jurisdictions.\n * Crowding out local businesses: The market power and economies of scale of\n   large MNCs make it difficult for local firms to compete, stifling local\n   entrepreneurs.\n * Political blackmail: Some argue that the IMF and World Bank's policy\n   prescriptions to attract FDI, such as deregulation and austerity, undermine\n   governments' ability to invest in public services and protect national\n   interests. However, giving up FDI would mean turning away funds needed for\n   local development, leading to Faustian bargains for many developing\n   countries.\n\n\nTHE SLOWDOWN IN FDI FLOWS\n\nBelow is a chart of the global FDI inflows as a percentage of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) in recent decades. As you can see, the percentage spikes at the\nturn of the millennium, during the financial crisis, and then immediately after.\nThis indicates a substantial increase in the flow of foreign capital into\neconomies worldwide, reflecting a growing interest from multinational\ncorporations and investors in expanding their operations and investments abroad.\nIt could also, of course, suggest moments when capital flowed abroad, when there\nwas significant volatility in the home markets. The largest FDI inflows occur\ninto the U.S. and other developed economies.\n\n\nDeveloping countries have encouraged FDI\u2014that is, the expansion of MNCs\u2014to\nfinance infrastructure and create new jobs for local workers. For their part,\nthe MNCs gain from FDI by expanding further into international markets.\n\nSeveral factors are said to drive increases in FDI inflows, a measure of MNC\nexpansion beyond their home countries' borders:\n\n * Economic liberalization: Many countries have opened up their economies to\n   foreign investment by reducing trade barriers, easing restrictions on capital\n   flows, and creating more favorable investment climates.\n * Technological advances: Improvements in communication and transportation have\n   made it easier for companies to operate across borders and manage global\n   supply chains.\n * Emerging markets: The rapid growth of emerging markets has created new\n   prospects for foreign investors seeking higher returns in relatively untapped\n   markets.\n * Financial globalization: The increasing integration of financial markets has\n   made cross-border capital flows possible and made it easier for investors to\n   invest in foreign projects.\n\nGlobal FDI flows have declined significantly as a share of GDP from around 3.3%\nin the 2000s to only 1.5% or so in recent years, and this drop has\ndisproportionately affected emerging markets. While FDI flows to developed\ncountries like the U.S. increased by 29% in 2023, flows to developing countries\ndecreased by 9%.\u00a0\n\nWhile the percentages and acronyms thrown around in many of these discussions\ncan seem abstract, the consequences are not. These represent millions of jobs,\nthe aspirations of local and regional economies, and massive inequalities\nworldwide that keep poverty entrenched in some regions of the globe.\n\nThe political stakes couldn't be higher. The terms economists use for the recent\ndrop in FDI flows include \"global economic fragmentation,\" which suggests a\nmovement away from a previous era's economic integration and globalization. The\ntrade wars between the U.S. and China, the pandemic, rising nationalism, and\nregional wars have upended earlier investment patterns, just as they have\nbillions of lives. We seem to have entered a new chapter, perhaps, in the\nhistory of the multinational corporation.\n\n\n\nWHY WOULD A BUSINESS WANT TO BECOME A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY?\n\nUsually, a business's primary goal is to increase profits and growth. If it can\ngrow a global customer base and increase its market share abroad, it may believe\nopening offices in foreign countries is worth the expense and effort. Companies\nmay benefit from certain tax structures or regulatory regimes found abroad.\n\n\nHOW DO MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS INFLUENCE GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES?\n\nMNCs greatly affect trade policies through lobbying efforts and economic\ndiplomacy. They advocate for trade agreements and regulations that favor their\nbusiness operations, often helping to shape policies to reduce tariffs, improve\nmarket access, and protect intellectual property rights. MNCs leverage their\neconomic might to negotiate favorable terms with governments, influencing\ninternational trade to attain environments conducive to their growth.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME RISKS MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS FACE?\n\nMultinational corporations are exposed to risks related to the different\ncountries and regions in which they operate. These can include regulatory or\nlegal risks, political instability, crime and violence, cultural sensitivities,\nand fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nMultinational corporations are as influential as any stakeholders in the global\neconomy, with the potential to drive economic growth and development in the\ncountries where they operate. However, their impact on host countries,\nparticularly in the developing world, is not without controversy. While MNCs can\nbring valuable foreign direct investment, technology, and expertise, they also\nraise concerns about exploitation, loss of sovereignty, and uneven distribution\nof benefits.\n\nAs global FDI flows decline, especially in developing countries, policymakers,\nbusinesses, and civil society must work together to create a more balanced and\nequitable framework for international investment. Ultimately, the role of MNCs\nin global development is complex and constantly evolving, shaped by the actions\nand decisions of countless stakeholders worldwide.",

        "content": "We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart\nproductivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. Yet it\ncould also replace jobs and deepen inequality.\n\nThe rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated the world, causing\nboth excitement and alarm, and raising important questions about its potential\nimpact on the global economy. The net effect is difficult to foresee, as AI will\nripple through economies in complex ways. What we can say with some confidence\nis that we will need to come up with a set of policies to safely leverage the\nvast potential of AI for the benefit of humanity.\n\nReshaping the Nature of Work\n\nIn a new analysis, IMF staff examine the potential impact of AI on the global\nlabor market. Many studies have predicted the likelihood that jobs will be\nreplaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases AI is likely to complement human\nwork. The IMF analysis captures both these forces.\n\nThe findings are striking: almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to\nAI. Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect\nroutine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact\nhigh-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from\nAI\u2014but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits\u2014compared with emerging\nmarket and developing economies.\n\nIn advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly\nhalf the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity.\nFor the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by\nhumans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced\nhiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.\n\nIn emerging markets and low-income countries, by contrast, AI exposure is\nexpected to be 40 percent and 26 percent, respectively. These findings suggest\nemerging market and developing economies face fewer immediate disruptions from\nAI. At the same time, many of these countries don\u2019t have the infrastructure or\nskilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over\ntime the technology could worsen inequality among nations.\n\n\n\nAI could also affect income and wealth inequality within countries. We may see\npolarization within income brackets, with workers who can harness AI seeing an\nincrease in their productivity and wages\u2014and those who cannot falling behind.\nResearch\u00a0shows that AI can help less experienced workers enhance their\nproductivity more quickly. Younger workers may find it easier to exploit\nopportunities, while older workers could struggle to adapt.\n\nThe effect on labor income will largely depend on the extent to which AI will\ncomplement high-income workers. If AI significantly complements higher-income\nworkers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase in their labor income.\nMoreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI will likely boost\ncapital returns, which may also favor high earners. Both of these phenomena\ncould exacerbate inequality.\n\nIn most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend\nthat policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from\nfurther stoking social tensions. It is crucial for countries to establish\ncomprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programs for vulnerable\nworkers. In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting\nlivelihoods and curbing inequality.\n\nAn Inclusive AI-Driven World\n\nAI is being integrated into businesses around the world at remarkable speed,\nunderscoring the need for policymakers to act.\n\nTo help countries craft the right policies, the IMF has developed an AI\nPreparedness Index that measures readiness in areas such as digital\ninfrastructure, human-capital and labor-market policies, innovation and economic\nintegration, and regulation and ethics.\n\nThe human-capital and labor-market policies component, for example, evaluates\nelements such as years of schooling and job-market mobility, as well as the\nproportion of the population covered by social safety nets. The regulation and\nethics component assesses the adaptability to digital business models of a\ncountry\u2019s legal framework and the presence of strong governance for effective\nenforcement.\n\nUsing the index, IMF staff assessed the readiness of 125 countries. The findings\nreveal that wealthier economies, including advanced and some emerging market\neconomies, tend to be better equipped for AI adoption than low-income countries,\nthough there is considerable variation across countries. Singapore, the United\nStates and Denmark posted the highest scores on the index, based on their strong\nresults in all four categories tracked.\n\n\n\nGuided by the insights from the AI Preparedness Index, advanced economies should\nprioritize AI innovation and integration while developing robust regulatory\nframeworks. This approach will cultivate a safe and responsible AI environment,\nhelping maintain public trust. For emerging market and developing economies, the\npriority should be laying a strong foundation through investments in digital\ninfrastructure and a digitally competent workforce.\n\nThe AI era is upon us, and it is still within our power to ensure it brings\nprosperity for all.\n\n\u2014For more on artificial intelligence and the economy, see the December issue\u00a0of\nFinance & Development, the IMF\u2019s quarterly magazine.\n\n",

On a January afternoon, the\npresident of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\nis at H\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, a designated Palace-grade hotel in the\n8th arrondissement that\u2019s hosted real-life royalty and the fictional kind: the\nprotagonist of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d composes letters from the\nhotel lobby.\n\nOn this particular day, Arora, a Los Angeles resident, is in Paris for work,\nthough the City of Light isn\u2019t why. Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, the luxury hotel\nmanagement arm of Hong Kong-based Rosewood Hotel Group, is opening the\nRosewood Schloss Fuschl, close to Salzburg, Austria, later this year and though\nRosewood also has a hotel in Vienna, Arora is working out of Paris, ensconced in\nthe landmark Crillon. Paris for any occasion.\n\nThe city and the hotel mean more to Arora than just plain work stopovers; they\nboth played pivotal roles in Arora\u2019s upbringing as the son of a foreign service\nworker. \u201cIt\u2019s a great love affair I have with the city,\u201d he said, and for good\nreason. Arora may have a 40-plus-year career in the hotel industry, but one\ncould argue he\u2019s been in it his whole life. Travel is requisite for someone\nworking in the foreign service and when his father received his first posting\nabroad in Moscow, the entire family accompanied him from Arora\u2019s birthplace of\nNew Delhi.\n\nPrior to Russia came a stop in London, where the family stayed at the Strand\nPalace, just across the way from one of the world\u2019s iconic hotels, The Savoy,\nwhich, among other London hospitality institutions, Arora refers to as a paragon\nof hotel virtue.\n\nRadha Arora is president of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. He joined the company 13\nyears ago after learning the luxury ropes with Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts.\n\nAfter Russia came Paris, where, by pure coincidence, the family lived in the\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon, which opened as a hotel in 1909, but stood as a building since\n1758\u2014in 1793, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were guillotined in the\nPlace de la Concorde directly in front of it. It\u2019s a rich, even macabre history.\n\nIt was the 60s when his love affair with the hotel industry coalesced. How could\nit not when you are a real-life Eloise? \u201cLiving in hotels, being surrounded by\nand building relationships with the housekeepers, the room-service staff, the\nbellman, the concierge, front desk\u2014that desire to be around people that are so\ncaring and nurturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were my formative years.\u201d\n\nIt was precisely those years that led him to a career in hospitality because\ntradition did not. It\u2019s typical Indian culture to strive to become a lawyer, a\ndoctor, a financier, but \u201cI wanted to be a hotelier,\u201d Arora said, adding that,\nat one point, dentistry was in the cards. Unlike a film or novel, there was no\npaternal pushback. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018You\u2019ve lived in hotels, you love hotels, you\nlove the smell of a hotel, it is all you talk about.\u2019 That was it. I went with\nhospitality.\u201d\n\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel in Paris, is a Palace-grade hotel and a\nproperty that Arora once lived in as a boy.\n\n\nON THE WAY UP\n\nArora studied hospitality in school, but his career journey didn\u2019t start until\nthe 1980s, with his first hotel job in London, as a night receptionist at the\nInn on the Park London, which later became a Four Seasons hotel after its owners\ntook the advice of a little- known Canadian hotelier named Isadore Sharp. (Arora\nrefers to him as the god of hospitality.) It was a pivotal moment for Four\nSeasons because it was its first hotel outside Canada.\n\nFour Seasons had a profound impact on Arora. The company now has more than 120\nhotels worldwide, but back then, there were only a handful, and most were in\nCanada. \u201cLondon was a hallmark of their success,\u201d Arora said, as transatlantic\ntravel boomed, spurred by the likes of the Concorde, which allowed the affluent\nto be on Broadway one night and the West End the next. For two years he was at\nthe hotel, doing the income audit, checking in guests and \u201cI loved it,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is no shortage of luxury hotels in London and there is no more effective\nway to learn the ropes than by immersing oneself in the culture. That\u2019s what\nArora did. He worked at small luxury hotels, like DUKES London in St. James\u2019s;\nhe worked at large luxury hotels, such as the InterContinental London Park Lane;\nand along the way, he picked up experience in all the varied disciplines\u2014from\nfront-of-the-house guest-facing interactions to back-of-the-house accounting,\nArora was front and center on his career arc, soaking it all in. \u201cI just wanted\nto work in great hotels,\u201d Arora said.\n\nThe lobby of The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel in New York\u2019s Upper East SIde.\n\nHe eventually became hotel manager of the famed Ritz London, where he remained\nfor seven years, a stint that included many chance meetings with the likes of\nPrincess Diana, who had a friend living in the hotel. Arora called the Princess\none of the most disarming people he\u2019d ever encountered. \u201cEverybody felt\nconnected to her,\u201d he said. And while Princess Diana was swarmed wherever she\nwent in public, Arora says that the biggest luxury anyone can have of her ilk,\nwithin a luxury hotel, is anonymity.\n\nArora\u2019s connection to London ended when the siren call of Four Seasons beckoned\nhim back. He returned to the company in 1994 and was with them for the next 17\nyears. He felt \u201cat home\u201d with Four Seasons and wanted out of London.\n\nArora took posts from Toronto to Hawaii and even for a time back in his home\ncountry, working in Goa, India. His last position with Four Seasons was one of\nthe most coveted jobs in hospitality: regional vice president and GM of the\nBeverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel, where he stayed for seven years. He\ncalls Los Angeles home today.\n\nIt was that post with Four Seasons that directly led to what is now a\n13-year-and-still-counting career with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. The Beverly\nWilshire might have been managed by Four Seasons, but it was owned by the Cheng\nfamily of Hong Kong, which, in 2011, acquired a portfolio of Rosewood-managed\nproperties from Maritz, Wolff & Co., five total, including The Carlyle, a\nRosewood Hotel, in New York, and Rosewood Little Dix Bay Resort in the British\nVirgin Islands. At the time of the transaction, the Cheng family stated that\n\u201cRosewood will be positioned for substantially accelerated global growth.\u201d\n\nRosewood Munich is housed in two restored historic buildings\u2014the former State\nBank of Bavaria headquarters and the adjacent Palais Neuhaus-Preysing\naristocratic residence.\n\n\nCOMING UP ROSES\n\nSome 13 years later, Rosewood, under the stewardship of the Cheng family and its\nscion/ CEO, Sonia Cheng, have grown the portfolio to 33 hotels operating and a\nslew more on the way, including a prospective seven more hotels in Greater China\nand seven more in Europe, which includes the The Chancery Rosewood in London,\nslated to open in 2025, and housed in the former U.S. Embassy on Grosvenor\nSquare. Arora calls it an emblem of the Rosewood brand.\n\nRosewood is also opening hotels in destinations beyond what would be considered\nthe norm. This year, it will open Rosewood Miyakojima in Japan, \u201ca destination\nthat our clients would not normally have ever dreamed of,\u201d Arora said.\n\nHe\u2019s been along for the entire ride. The Cheng family recognized greatness in\nArora by his successes in the U.S.\u2014 including the Beverly Wilshire, he had eight\nother hotels under his purview. The idea around Rosewood\u2014and qualified in the\ncompany statement when it acquired the company\u2014was to scale it up, but in a\nmanner that still allowed it to retain its almost provincial charm.\n\nBack in 2011, Sonia Cheng, Arora remembered, referred to Rosewood as a gentle\ngiant that needed to be awakened, a diamond in the rough that just needed some\nbuffing. Arora refers to the 43-year-old Cheng as his \u201cfountain of youth\u201d and\nhis best friend.\n\nWith a startup company mentality, the idea was to expand the brand globally, but\nin a manner where the culture was not bastardized. \u201cEach one of our properties\nis unique, distinct to its culture. That\u2019s what Rosewood is,\u201d Arora said.\nConsider The Carlyle, one of New York\u2019s famed hotels that shares the\nneighborhood with other celebrated hotels. Talk about unique: the hotel\u2019s\nBemelmans Bar features wall murals by Ludwig Bemelmans, the creator of the\nclassic Madeline children\u2019s books, while Woody Allen used to play clarinet with\nhis jazz band on Monday nights in Caf\u00e9 Carlyle. It\u2019s even appeared in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex\n& The City.\u201d Of the hotel, Arora said, \u201cWhen you create a property where you go\nto a city to the hotel versus for the city itself, you know you have a winner.\nIt\u2019s one of those properties where when you walk in you get goosebumps.\u201d\n\nA marbled bathroom at Rosewood Hong Kong, which soars over Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe hotel recently finished off a decade-in-the- making renovation that was\npainstakingly deliberate and meticulous to preserve the hotel\u2019s patina and\ncontinue its legacy. Arora said the older Rosewood properties, from The Caryle\nto Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, act as signposts for the newer\nRosewood properties to come.\n\nRosewood now has a handful of owned properties that Arora calls the linchpins,\nwhich, he says, act almost as showrooms. Now, the idea is to expand through an\nasset-light model, partnering with people who want a piece of Rosewood in their\nportfolio, maybe even more so for the prestige, rather than the returns. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot your typical institutional partner,\u201d Arora said.\n\nPart of Arora\u2019s remit is to strike and nurture these deals, to grow the Rosewood\nbrand by working in tandem with partners to achieve the best results, which is\nwhy Arora keeps a frenzied travel schedule. Arora favors a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\nconversation over a Zoom call. In October 2023, Town & Country published an\narticle titled: \u201cRadha Arora Shares His Favorites for Being at Home or Away.\u201d\nExpectedly, Bose QuietComfort Headphones were cited; surprisingly, were\nBlackwing pencils, which he wears down to the nub: \u201cWe\u2019re in the aesthetics\nbusiness; I work with great designers and architects, and I\u2019ve seen them use\nthese pencils, so when I have one, I feel like I, too, can contribute in some\nway,\u201d he told Town & Country.\n\nArora has contributed in many ways, but it\u2019s not just the contributions he\u2019s\nmade to propel the business, it\u2019s the contributions he\u2019s made to those around\nhim. \u201cIt\u2019s being respectful of others,\u201d Arora said. \u201cHumanity is what our\nindustry is all about. If you endorse the culture through the way you speak to\nsomebody else, then everything else pales.\u201d\n\nPassionate is how Arora believes others see him. Passionate about the way he\ngoes about his business and in his daily relationships. \u201cThis is just who I am,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt\u2019s about loyalty to our partners and to our teams. When you have\nthis culture, where you create this sense of pride, at every level, that is\nimpenetrable, and it propagates creativity.\u201d\n\nRosewood Mayakoba in Mexico\u2019s Riviera Maya.\n\nIt\u2019s taken time to grow the Rosewood brand to be a powerhouse, standing shoulder\nto shoulder with the likes of Ritz-Carlton and Arora\u2019s old outfit, Four Seasons.\nIt wasn\u2019t David slinging Goliath, but it wasn\u2019t easy; it took time and it took\nconvincing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different luxury players,\u201d Arora said. Consider H\u00f4tel de\nCrillon. It\u2019s owned by a Saudi Arabian prince, but it took some time coaxing him\nthat Rosewood was the right partner to operate the hotel. \u201cHe\u2019d ask us, \u2018Why\nRosewood? You have no properties in Europe. No infrastructure.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer seems easy but it\u2019s hard to execute on. What it really is, is a\npromise, an assurance of uniqueness and mystique, Arora said. His pitch: \u201cWe are\na well-known brand in the U.S. that will continue to evolve in Europe. You need\nto trust us with this passion and desire. We\u2019ll work on it personally.\u201d\n\nIt happened. \u201cTwelve years later, partners come to us,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe\u2019re very\nfortunate to be in the position to have created this appealing brand.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s had a big hand in it, and Arora says that his job today is to preserve the\nbrand and its culture.\n\nThirteen years in with Rosewood, Arora doesn\u2019t have any plans to go anywhere\nsoon. Besides, he said, his boss wouldn\u2019t allow it. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not going\nanywhere,\u2019\u201d Cheng has told him.\n\nHe\u2019s also in no hurry to be anywhere else. \u201cWhy would I want to? Every day is a\nunique day.\u201d",

So, while a good hotel can make you feel as comfortable as\nyou would at home, a great hotel can offer you something even better \u2014 a feeling\nof belonging in a brand-new, upgraded, and wholly unique space. The new Rosewood\nMunich does exactly that.\n\n\u201cMunich hasn\u2019t seen this before \u2014 a hotel with a vibe,\u201d Radha Arora, president\nof Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, told me over cocktails at the hotel\u2019s opening f\u00eate\nin October. The hotel, he added, \u201cspeaks to the community, with all the artists\nwe showcase, it speaks to place. We have great confidence in this location.\u201d\n\nThe Rosewood Munich, as it stands now, is the culmination of a project 10 years\nin the making. And it\u2019s just as spectacular as you\u2019d expect a decade\u2019s worth of\nwork to be.\n\n\nALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS BRAND-NEW ROSEWOOD HOTEL IN MUNICH\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nEvery space, including the lobby, 132 guest rooms, restaurant Brasserie\nCuvilli\u00e9s, and Asaya Spa, is decked out in muted earth tones, light woods, and\npops of royal blues and decadent, emerald green velvet furnishings you simply\ncannot stop running your hands over.\n\nThis includes the hotel\u2019s signature Maximillian Suite, named after a royal\nBavarian family, that sports more than 2,500 square feet of living space,\nincluding a full kitchen and soaking tubs in each bathroom, which starts at\naround USD 25,000 (HKD 195,687) a night. All these glamorous decor touches are\nthanks to Tara Bernerd & Partners, who worked alongside the Munich-based\narchitectural firm Hilmer Sattler to ensure the space honoured its location\nwhile creating the most welcoming (and decadent) space possible.\n\n\u201cRosewood Munich is our first project in Germany with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\nand is a key moment for us,\u201d Bernerd shared in a statement. \u201cWe have sought to\nbring a refined residential style with a contemporary take on Baroque\narchitecture. This elevated sense of sophistication will provide a place for\nlocals and distinguished travellers to come together in this vibrant and\neclectic city.\u201d\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nWhile the Rosewood Munich still has that brand-new hotel smell, it somehow feels\nlived in. It\u2019s massive, yet cosy. Walking through the common spaces, you\u2019re\nbound to find friends, old and new, gathering for tasty chocolates set out on\nthe table, guests reading books while lounging on the plush chairs next to the\npicture windows, and perhaps even a four-legged companion or two laying out as\nif they owned the place.\n\nHowever, there is one spot you may or may not get to see while you\u2019re at the\nhotel \u2014 its ultra-exclusive and downright secretive speakeasy, known as 100B. I\ndon\u2019t want to give away too many details here, as half the fun is finding it for\nyourself. However, I did get a sneak peek at 100B, which is well\nhidden-somewhere near the bar. It\u2019s as sexy a place as they come, with rich, red\nleather furnishings, dim lighting, and some fantastically rare spirits behind\nthe bar, including a few bottles of Pappy Van Winkle that will send any whiskey\nlover into full-on fanfare. Want to get in? Try to make friends with a hotel\nbartender. He or she might reveal the secret code and the location. Just don\u2019t\nbe surprised if they look at you in total bewilderment when you ask about 100B,\nas it truly is meant to stay exclusive.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know about the hotel and my full review of the new\nRosewood Munich.\n\n[myaffiliate type=\u201dnormal\u201d button_name=\u201dShop the best travel experiences here \u201d\nurl=\u201dhttps://experiences.travelandleisureasia.com/\u201d align=\u201dcenter\u201d\nclass=\u201daffiliate-one\u201d\n\n\nTHE ROOMS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThe hotel has 73 spacious guest rooms and 59 suites, including five exclusive\nhouses, which are massive, apartment-style accommodations ideal for big groups\nor extended-stay guests. Entry-level rooms range from EUR 700 (HKD 5,941) \u2013 EUR\n2,750 (HKD 23,342); while suites range from EUR 1,200 (HKD 10,185) \u2013 EUR 4,650\n(HKD 39,469); and houses range from EUR 4,300 (HKD 36,498) \u2013 EUR 35,000 (HKD\n297,081). Every room has a fantastic view of either the Munich city skyline or\nits interior courtyard. Expect bespoke furnishings, minibars filled with local\ntreats, and marble bathrooms with not-to-miss rosemary-infused shampoos that\nwill leave your hair smelling better than ever.\n\n\nTHE SPA\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThe hotel\u2019s Asaya Spa draws much of its decor and treatment inspiration from its\nalpine surroundings. Here, guests can indulge in holistic treatments using\nproducts by Dr Barbara Sturm, OTO, Ground Wellbeing, and EviDenS de Beaut\u00e9. The\n1,300-square-foot spa includes an indoor pool, dual saunas, steam rooms, and six\ntreatment rooms. I recommend springing for The Aufguss Journey, a 120-minute\ntreatment that uses aromatherapy and happens over three phases \u2014 a body scrub, a\nwrap, and a massage. I loved that the treatment uses a native pine and spruce\nblend for that all-important \u201csense of place\u201d the Rosewood is known for.\n\n\nFOOD AND DRINKS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nRosewood Munich is bringing more fine dining to the city thanks to Cuvilli\u00e9s.\nThe brasserie is open to both guests and locals who wish to come enjoy meals\nbuilt around ingredients sourced from the region, including Helmut Schlader\nAlpine caviar, Wagyu beef from Tegernsee, and lamb from a breeder in Jochberg,\nlocated just two hours away. The menu highlights include bites of steckerlfisch\n(grilled fish) alongside spinach dumplings, and, of course, wiener schnitzel.\nBut please don\u2019t overlook the Celeriac Cream Soup as an appetiser. Made with\ntruffle, spices, and white balsamic, it\u2019s the perfect start to a hearty meal.\n\nFollowing your last bite, make your way to Bar Montez, where you can not only\nget a craft cocktail, wine, or local beer, but you can also take in live music\nby jazz musicians strumming in the corner.\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\nACTIVITIES AND EXPERIENCES\n\nThere is a dedicated concierge team at the hotel to assist guests in planning a\nbespoke itinerary. The team can help book exclusive guided tours through local\nmuseums like the Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art (MUCA), as well as visits\nto historic destinations like the Nymphenburg Palace or more adrenaline-filled\nactivities like BMW Driving Tours.\n\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY OFFERINGS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nKids are also more than welcome at the hotel. The concierge team is happy to\ncreate experiences just for them, including local cooking classes and arts and\ncrafts sessions. The hotel is also happy to assist in babysitting services so\nparents can head out for a night on the town sans kids.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\nThe Rosewood Munich is ADA compliant, offering three ADA-compliant rooms, and\nhas a ground-floor elevator to allow easy access in and out of the building. As\nfor sustainability, during the hotel\u2019s construction, the team recycled 96\npercent of the materials from the demolition to use in the new space, including\n1,500 tons of metal, cables, copper pipes, reinforced concrete, and glass. This\nhotel, like other Rosewood properties, is in line with Rosewood\u2019s principle of\n\u201cRelationship Hospitality,\u201d meaning it has a close relationship with local\nsuppliers to reduce environmental demands on the supply chain. And, perhaps most\nimpressive of all, the brasserie kitchen has bins to convert waste to energy,\nwhich powers part of the restaurant.\n\n\nHOW TO GET THE MOST VALUE\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThere are a few ways to maximise your value at Rosewood. Book one of the\nRosewood Escapes, which includes complimentary breakfast for two, complimentary\naccess to Asaya Spa, and complimentary access to the fitness suite.

The castle, originally a hunting lodge for the\nPrince-Archbishops of Salzburg, dates back to 1461. Long a part of the Holy\nRoman Empire, the area became part of Austria in 1803. The last\nPrince-Archbishop who exercised secular authority, Count Hieronymus von\nColloredo, is remembered today as a patron of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\na native of Salzburg.\n\nThe resort offers a look at the area\u2019s history and culture with personalized\ntours curated by the Rosewood concierge team. Cultural programming includes\nbehind the scenes experiences with famous Austrian umbrella craftsman, Mr.\nKirchtag, and private tours of Festspielhaus, Salzburg\u2019s historic opera hall.\n\nThe 100-year-old Salzburg Festival, which features opera, drama and concerts, is\nworld-renowned. The opening of Rosewood Schloss Fuschl is well-timed for the\n2024 festival, which begins July 19 and stretches into August.\n\nSalzburg was not only once the home of the Von Trapp family but was also a\nfilming location for The Sound of Music. Aficionados of the film can enjoy\nFraulein Maria\u2019s bicycle tour or visit a \u201cSound of Music\u201d puppet performance at\nthe Marionette Theater in Salzburg. The setting and lakeside ambiance may create\nsome somber thoughts of a different Austria.\n\nThe Rosewood Schloss Fuschl also offers more conventional adventure in the Alps,\nsuch as hikes with an herbalist to explore the flora and fauna, as well as\ncooking demonstrations by local experts in nearby alpine huts. The area offers\nmany scenic views of the forests and mountains.

The fishing trips end with smoked fish\nwrapped in newspaper just like the locals eat it, washed down with Austrian\nwine.\n\nFor outdoor recreation, the area offers golf, tennis, biking and horseback\nriding in addition to hiking. In the winter, there is ice skating, tobogganing\nand skiing.\n\nThe resort says that by sourcing most ingredients and materials from within a\n100-kilometer radius, it not only ensures freshness but also reduces carbon\nemissions associated with transportation. The Schloss Fuschl honeybee colony\nproduces local honey and plays a crucial role in pollinating the surrounding\nflowers.

Rosewood\nbelieves it will at a half-dozen of its ultra-luxury hotels.\n\nSean O'Neill\n\nRosewood Hotel Group, the ultra-luxury brand, has quietly launched a program\nthat sets a higher bar for meeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\ngoals.\n\nThe initiative, called Impact Trailblazers, spotlights hotels that pledge to\nachieve at least one of six stretch goals by 2025. Goals include reducing waste\nlike single-use plastics, sourcing supplies locally, and developing community\npartnerships to hire locally.\n\n\u201cThese properties are not just meeting our ambitious sustainability goals \u2014\nthey\u2019re exceeding them, showcasing that luxury and positive impact can be\nsynonymous,\u201d said Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed, vice president of social impact at\nRosewood Hotel Group, in an exclusive interview.\n\nRosewood hopes its half-dozen top performers inspire all of its hotels and the\nbroader industry. It operates 44 hotels and has over 30 in development.\n\nThe program claims to have some early results. Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo has achieved\n90% waste diversion, operates on 100% renewable energy, and has hired 45% of its\nworkforce from underserved groups. Rosewood Phuket sources all ingredients for\nits signature restaurant locally. Rosewood Mayakoba in Mexico supports a\nnon-profit school, while Rosewood Phnom Penh partners with a vocational training\nnon-profit in Cambodia.\n\nRosewood Mayakoba. Source: Rosewood.\n\n\nROSEWOOD\u2019S IMPACT\n\nHere are some of the early successes claimed by these hotels.\n\n * Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo\u00a0has achieved 90% waste diversion and operates on 100%\n   renewable energy. It has hired 45% of its workforce from underserved local\n   groups.\n\n * Rosewood Phuket\u00a0has been one of the local pioneers in environmental\n   sustainability, earning LEED Gold Certification and achieving local sourcing\n   goals. Its signature restaurant, Ta Khai, sources all ingredients locally,\n   supporting community farmers using sustainable practices.\n\n * Rosewood Mayakoba\u00a0revived a non-profit school in Riviera Maya that had\n   stopped functioning and now supports over 450 students. It recently added a\n   separate building for a new secondary school.\n\n * Rosewood Phnom Penh\u00a0partners with a local non-profit offering vocational\n   training to Cambodian youth, bringing in students for performances and\n   demonstrations of local artistic traditions.\n\n * Rosewood Baha Mar\u00a0focuses on coral conservation in The Bahamas, partnering\n   with the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation. The resort employs\n   95% local staff and promotes diversity and female representation at\n   supervisory levels.\n\n * Rosewood Hong Kong\u00a0introduced BluHouse, a restaurant concept that employs\n   refugees and ethnic minorities.\n\n\nHOTEL BUSINESS BENEFITS\n\nAhmed challenged the notion that doing good compromises business performance.\n\n\u201cThe travel sector accepts that there\u2019s a trade-off between doing well and doing\ngood far too easily,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cThe fact that two of our Impact Trailblazers\nproperties \u2014 Rosewood Hong Kong and Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 were recently featured\nin the latest 50 Best Hotels list shows that there\u2019s definitely not a trade-off\nin delivering luxury and having a positive social impact.\u201d\n\nThe efforts can also translate into enhancing guest loyalty.\n\n\u201cLuxury is a feeling,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the connection we create with our\nguests, and this can be fostered even without spelling out the social impact\npiece.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve stayed at Rosewood Mayakoba, you\u2019ll know that each guest receives a\nbeautiful little, colorful, folklore animal representative of Mayan culture,\u201d\nAhmed said. \u201cGuests have commented positively on these figurines. But what most\ndon\u2019t know is that these figures are special because they are carved through a\npartnership with a social enterprise that hires women recovery from domestic\nabuse.\u201d\n\nRosewood executives also believe that hotels with a social impact work have a\nbetter chance of attracting and retaining top talent.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has accelerated this trend of people wanting to know that the work\nthat they are doing most of the hours of their day is doing something positive\nfor the world,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\n\nACCOMMODATIONS SECTOR STOCK INDEX PERFORMANCE YEAR-TO-DATE\n\nWhat am I looking at?\u00a0The performance of hotels and short-term rental sector\nstocks within the\u00a0ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across\nglobal markets, including international and regional hotel brands, hotel REITs,\nhotel management companies, alternative accommodations, and timeshares.\n\nThe Skift Travel 200 (ST200)\u00a0combines the financial performance of nearly 200\ntravel companies worth more than a trillion dollars into a single number.

Taking the number two spot and earning the distinction of \u201cThe Best\nHotel in Asia\u201d was Rosewood Hong Kong. Rosewood Sao Paulo ranked at number 27,\nwhile Hotel de Crillon in Paris rounded up the list at number 50.\n\nThe achievement is \u201ca huge recognition to the team and all the effort they have\nput into the brand,\u201d reflected Sonia Cheng, CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group. \u201cFor\nthree of our properties to be recognised, and for Rosewood Hong Kong to be\nnumber two in the world, that is a significant recognition.\u201d\n\nCheng, 43, hails from one of Hong Kong\u2019s billionaire family dynasties. Her\ngrandfather, the late Cheng Yu-tung, founded real estate and investment\nconglomerate, New World Development. The elder Cheng\u2019s rags-to-riches story\nbegan when he turned a Macau gold shop into the now renowned Chow Tai Fook\nJewellery chain. His son, and Cheng\u2019s father, Henry Cheng, is now chairman of\nthe businesses.\n\nAfter pursuing a career in banking and finance, Cheng, who graduated from\nHarvard with a major in applied mathematics, joined the family fold at the age\nof 28 to head up its hospitality business. In 2011, New World Hospitality\nacquired Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, then based in Texas, US, for a reported\nUS$229.5 million. Back then, while the Rosewood name was familiar among North\nAmerican travellers, it was not well-known on an international scale.\n\nUnder Cheng\u2019s leadership, Rosewood has since evolved into a global player in the\nluxury hospitality space, with openings in key cities including Beijing, London,\nAbu Dhabi, Munich and more. Its portfolio of 33 one-of-a-kind luxury hotels in\n21 countries also includes legendary properties such as The Carlyle in New York,\nand the Hotel de Crillon in Paris, both of which have undergone a transformation\nunder Rosewood.\n\nThere are currently another 27 hotels in the pipeline, with Cheng describing the\nnext two years as Rosewood\u2019s \u201cpeak opening years\u201d, where it will continue to\nexpand in Europe, Japan, the Middle East, China, Mexico, New Zealand and more.\n\u201cThe next couple of years is really exciting. Key gateway cities have always\nbeen our target, but we also explore new destinations and projects that we think\nfit the Rosewood philosophy. These projects may not be in gateway locations that\ntravellers expect, but I think what travellers are looking for in this day and\nage is for Rosewood to take them on a journey to explore new destinations.\u201d\n\nLink to source\n\nRead the full article at Rosewood Hotel Group",

Over the last five years, the Group has experienced ambitious yet\nthoughtful growth, with its ultra-luxury Rosewood Hotels & Resorts brand signing\nan impressive number of new deals compared to its competitive set. Following a\nmonumental 2023 which introduced the Group into new global territories,\nincluding New Zealand and Hawaii; and lifestyle categories, including\nexperiential retail; 2024 promises to deliver even more new deal signings,\nproperty openings and enriching experiences in the world\u2019s most inspiring\ndestinations.\n\n\nA GROWING, GLOBAL PRESENCE\n\nRosewood Hotel Group\u2019s combined portfolio now consists of 48 hotels, resorts,\nand residences across 23 countries, each embracing the brand's A Sense of Place\u00ae\nphilosophy to reflect the individual location's history, culture, and\nsensibilities. For Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, 2023 saw three properties open:\nRosewood Munich, Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort, and the brand\u2019s New Zealand\nlodge collection consisting of Rosewood Cape Kidnappers, Rosewood Kauri Cliffs\nand Rosewood Matakauri. These launches represented the Group\u2019s first flags in\nGermany, Hawai\u2019i, and New Zealand, respectively, and brought Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts\u2019 total hotel count to 33 properties across 21 countries. For New World\nHotels & Resorts, the past year featured the launches of three new properties,\nwhich was a record for this growing brand and brought the total portfolio count\nto 15 properties. This development further expanded New World\u2019s footprint in\nVietnam and China, raising the brand\u2019s flag in Hoi An, Taishan and Guangzhou.\n\nEqually as impressive as the Group\u2019s operational portfolio is its curated\npipeline of projects, each of which has been thoughtfully considered to inspire\nadventure and discovery. Today, Rosewood Hotel Group has 35 properties under\ndevelopment, reflecting one of the industry\u2019s strongest pipelines when\nconsidered as a percentage of a brand\u2019s complete portfolio. While the Group\u2019s\npipeline has been consistently impressive, it is the past five years which have\nmade a profound impact on the trajectory of the company globally and its status\nas a leader in the industry.\n\nSix new deal signings for Rosewood Hotels & Resorts in 2023 contributed to this\npositioning. These include Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\u2019 first-ever properties in\nBarbuda, Greece, South Korea and the Maldives, together underscoring the brand\u2019s\ncommitment to bringing its unique approach to hospitality to both cultural\ncapitals and exotic island destinations. Rosewood Amaala was also announced in\n2023, which will mark the brand\u2019s fourth property in Saudi Arabia upon opening.\nThe deal to manage the iconic Robertson Lodges in New Zealand was also penned in\n2023.\n\n\nAREAS OF EXPANSION\n\nThese additions reiterate Rosewood\u2019s strategic areas for expansion. Having just\ngrown its presence in Europe by 100% in less than three years, the region\ncontinues to be a key focus for the Group. 2024 will see the opening of Rosewood\nAmsterdam in the Netherlands and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl in Austria, followed in\n2025 by new properties in Greece, Venice, Milan, Rome, and a second London\nhotel, The Chancery Rosewood.\n\nThe Middle East\u2019s propensity for luxury hospitality has been similarly central\nto the Group\u2019s strategic future expansion, with several new properties set to\njoin its Middle Eastern portfolio. Building upon its current presence in Abu\nDhabi and Jeddah, Rosewood Doha will open its doors in Qatar this year. In the\nMiddle East, future growth is focused on Saudi Arabia, whose ongoing\ntransformation for a new era of travel aligns naturally with Rosewood\u2019s\ntrailblazing reputation for impeccable, first-class service. Three new hotels\nare set to debut in Saudi Arabia in the coming years: Rosewood Diriyah in 2025,\nalongside the future openings Rosewood Red Sea and Rosewood Amaala.\n\nThe pipeline for Rosewood Hotel Group also continues to grow in Asia Pacific,\nand in 2024 will see the opening of Rosewood Miyakojima, marking Rosewood\u2019s\nentry into Japan. New World Chongqing Hotel in China will also debut in the\nforeseeable future. Looking further ahead, future openings in China include\nRosewood Shenzhen, Rosewood Hangzhou, Rosewood Shanghai, Rosewood Chongqing,\nRosewood Ningbo, and Rosewood Xi\u2019An. In the greater Asia Pacific region,\nanticipated destinations include Rosewood Hoi An, Rosewood Seoul and Rosewood\nRanfaru in the Maldives.\n\nIn the Americas, development stretches across The United States, Mexico, and The\nCaribbean. 2025 will add Rosewood Mexico City and Rosewood Mandarina to the\ngrowing portfolio of properties in Mexico. Looking ahead, another icon will be\nreborn under the Rosewood flag with Rosewood The Raleigh in Miami Beach, which\nwill include 44 Rosewood Residences in a newly built Peter Marino-designed\nbuilding. Also consisting of both a resort and residential experience will be\nRosewood Barbuda, opening on the exquisite Caribbean island in 2028.\n\n\nENRICHED LIVING, EVERY DAY\n\nRosewood Hotels & Resorts' branded residential business, Rosewood Residences, is\na refined collection of estate homes, luxury villas and serviced apartments\ncarefully curated to enrich the lives of all who call them home.

The industry has taken notice: in the 2023 Brand Residences\nReport produced by Savills [1], one of the world\u2019s pioneering real estate\nadvisors and consultancies, Rosewood Residences ranked 4th in its competitive\nset of independent luxury brands in regard to the number of completed and\npipeline projects.\n\nA highlight of this pipeline is six standalone residential properties, the first\nof which was only announced in 2021. The rapid growth of Rosewood Residences\u2019\nstandalone properties is a further proof point of guests\u2019 growing desire to\naccess the Rosewood lifestyle beyond the hotel and resort experiences. In 2023,\ntwo such destinations were identified and announced: Rosewood Residences\nHillsboro Beach in Florida and Rosewood Residences Turtle Creek in Dallas,\nTexas. These newly announced projects join the additional standalone pipeline\nproperties of Rosewood Residences Naples and Rosewood Residences Lido Key, both\nin Florida; Rosewood Residences Kamala in Phuket, and Rosewood Residences\nBeverly Hills in California. The Beverly Hills property will open later this\nyear to officially debut the exclusively residential Rosewood experience.\n\nAlongside these standalone properties in the pipeline are four Rosewood\nResidences that will be co-located within a hotel or resort property, including\nRosewood Residences Mandarina, Rosewood Residences Miami Beach, Rosewood\nResidences Doha, and Rosewood Residences Barbuda.\n\nAcross both the standalone and mixed-use properties in operation as well as in\ndevelopment, the team is continuously raising the bar to deliver an elevated\nlifestyle experience that speaks to the unique needs of today\u2019s buyer. New and\ninnovative offerings introduced or announced by Rosewood Residences in the last\nyear include elevated food and beverage services, such as expert wine curation,\nprivate restaurants and bars, and curated in-home dining; dedicated shared and\nprivate spaces for visiting guests, younger residents, and pets; indoor and\noutdoor amenities and social areas designed specifically for entertaining; and,\nof course, a range of state-of-the-art wellness experiences. As wellness is a\ntop priority for many people today, Rosewood Residences has taken great care to\nintroduce new opportunities for residents and guests to stay well, from paddle\ntennis and pickleball courts, private salons and spas, to rooftop yoga pitches\nand pools.\n\nIn the end, Rosewood Residences\u2019 impressive growth of its physical footprint and\ninnovative offerings contributed to a 135% increase in sales year over year in\n2023, with total sales amounting to $434 million. This demand underscores that\nRosewood Residences are providing buyers with the type of modern-day living that\nthey are looking for and a community of which they wish to be an active\nparticipant.\n\n\nASAYA: INTEGRATED APPROACH TO WELLNESS\n\nAsaya, Rosewood\u2019s integrated, holistic health and wellness concept designed to\nunlock long-lasting and transformative well-being, will flourish in 2024 with\nnew launches and unique experiences. Since its inception at Rosewood Phuket in\n2017, Asaya has launched in five additional locations. Today, there is Asaya\nActive at Rosewood Guangzhou, Asaya Retreat at Rosewood Hong Kong, and Asaya Spa\nat Rosewood Vienna, Rosewood Munich, and Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort.
