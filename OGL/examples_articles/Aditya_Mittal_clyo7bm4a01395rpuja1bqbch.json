With a quick draw while playing white, the Polish GM kept his second\nplace in the table, but at the same time remained a full point behind the rating\nfavourite.\n\nIt was therefore not very surprising that Aditya won the tournament on Sunday.\nHe got the half point he needed to obtain overall victory, but even in the event\nof a surprising defeat, Teclaf would not have been able to catch him, as he also\nhad to be satisfied with a draw against Zahar Efimenko.\n\nAditya\u2019s win in the 4th round was a turning point in the event.

        "content": "ArcelorMittal\u2019s exit from Kazakhstan and the nationalisation of the Acciaierie\nd\u2019Italia plant in Italy significantly affected its fourth quarter earnings in\n2023, the company said in its annual report published on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Luxembourg-based steel giant booked a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.97\nbillion, a swing from $261 million in net profit for the same quarter in 2022.\n\nThe company recorded a net income of $919 million for 2023 compared to $9.3\nbillion in 2022. Adjusted net income was $4.87 billion compared to $10.61\nbillion for the previous year. Nevertheless, the 2023 number represents\none-and-a-half times the average levels achieved during the 2012 to 2022 period,\nArcelorMittal said.\u00a0\n\nThe Luxembourg-based steel giant said it was taking $2.4 billion of losses on\nits Kazakh operations after it was cast out from the country following a series\nof work accidents that prompted an investigation by local authorities.\n\n160 workers have been killed in ArcelorMittal mines in Kazakhstan in less than a\ndecade, according to the Qaraqar Foundation, which raises money to bring legal\ncases against the company on behalf of Kazakh workers.\n\nThe company is also booking a further $1.4 billion impairment at its\nmajority-controlled Acciaierie d\u2019Italia business after Giorgia Meloni\u2019s\ngovernment started formal proceedings to put Europe\u2019s largest steelworks under\nspecial administration.\n\nArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal said that the 2023 results reflect the benefits\nof the structural improvements the company had made to its cost base, asset\nportfolio and balance sheet in recent years.\n\n> Looking ahead, there are early signs of a more constructive industry backdrop.\n\nAditya Mittal\n\nArcelorMittal CEO\n\n\u201cDespite the operating environment becoming increasingly challenging as the year\nprogressed, our profitability per tonne is healthy and well above long-term\naverages,\u201d Mittal said. \u201cLooking ahead, there are early signs of a more\nconstructive industry backdrop.\u201d\n\nIn its analysis, the company said it expected global demand (excluding China) to\nrecover in 2024 and grow by between 3-4% compared to 2023. Looking further\nahead, demand for steel will grow by some 300 million tonnes \u2013 around 35% - over\nthe next decade, the company said.\n\nThis will be driven not only by population growth, but also by factors including\nnew mobility systems, growing demand for supply chain security and the energy\ntransition, for which steel is a crucial enabler, according to ArcelorMittal.\n\nStrategic investments are estimated to add approximately $1.8 billion to\nEBITDA\u00a0(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth\nby the end of 2026, the company said.\u00a0\n\nNew projects expected to be commissioned in 2024 include the first phase of new\nelectrical steels capacity in Europe, additional capacity to existing plants in\nBrazil, the first iron ore concentrate in Liberia and projects in India and the\nUnited States. \u00a0\n\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nFollowing outcry over its safety record in Kazakhstan, in October last year the\ncompany had pledged to commission an independent third party global audit of its\nsafety related practices and actions. \u201cThis audit is now underway and I am\ndetermined its findings and recommendations, combined with the considerable\nefforts we are already implementing across the group, will make us a safer and\nultimately accident free company,\u201d said Aditya Mittal.\n\nThe company even managed to take a positive spin on the sale of its assets in\nKazakhstan, by stating that it now no longer owns and operates coal mines - the\nKazakh operations represented approximately 16.5% of the group\u2019s scope 1 and\nscope 2 carbon emissions.",

        "content": "Lakshmi mittal, the executive chairman of the steel group ArcelorMittal, would\nhave profited from the conflict in Ukraine. This is what emerges from a joint\ninvestigation conducted by the Sunday edition of the British newspaper \"The\nTimes\" and the non-governmental organization Global Witness. The Indian\nbillionaire, the main shareholder of the world's second largest steel producer,\nowns part of a company - of which his son is president - which has purchased\nRussian oil for 2,75 million euros since the invasion of Ukraine began. These\nimports, according to the investigation, have brought the equivalent of hundreds\nof millions of euros into the Kremlin's coffers, according to estimates based on\nRussian export duties. In 2007 Mittal helped found Hpcl-Mittal Energy Limited\n(Hmel), a joint venture between the public company Hindustan Petroleum\nCorporation Limited and Mittal Energy Investments, a company owned by the\nentrepreneur's family. Both parties own 49 percent of HMEL, with the rest held\nby financial institutions in New Delhi. Lakshmi's son Aditya is both the CEO of\nArcelorMittal and the chairman of Hmel.\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, the company imported small quantities of Russian\ncrude oil, but in May 2022, three months after the invasion of Ukraine, Hmel\nbegan importing large amounts of oil. Last month, according to Kpler, the\ncompany that monitors the traffic of raw materials, Hmel imported around 232\nthousand barrels of Russian crude per day. Kpler data shows that the\nMittal-linked company imported around seven million tonnes of Russian crude in\nthe first 18 months of the war alone. Based on tariffs imposed by Russia on its\noil exports, it is estimated that in the first seven months of 2023 Hmel's\npurchases brought the Kremlin the equivalent of approximately 722,8 million\neuros. These operations do not violate any law or sanctions as India has not\njoined the financial measures adopted against Russia since the beginning of the\nconflict in Ukraine but, on the contrary, has become one of the main importing\ncountries of Russian oil. In fact, India currently accounts for about a quarter\nof all Russian exports of crude and refined oil.\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\nFollow us on the social channels of Nova News on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,\nInstagram, Telegram",

        "content": "NEW DELHI (India CSR): In an era marked by rapid industrial growth and\nescalating climate concerns, India stands at a crucial juncture. ArcelorMittal\nNippon Steel India (AM/NS India), a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and\nNippon Steel, two of the world\u2019s leading steel manufacturing organisations has\nreleased its inaugural Climate Action Report, marking a pivotal step in its\njourney towards sustainable development.\n\nThe report, introduced by Chairman Aditya Mittal, underscores the company\u2019s\ncommitment to decarbonizing its operations amidst a rapidly evolving global\nlandscape that demands net-zero emissions.\n\nThe report has outlined a strategic plan to decarbonise its operations. This\nambitious initiative is set against the backdrop of India\u2019s journey towards\nbecoming a $5 trillion economy, with steel playing a pivotal role in the\nnation\u2019s developmental narrative.\n\nA leading integrated flat carbon steel producer in\u00a0India, the company has a\ncrude steel capacity of 9 million tonnes per annum with state-of-the-art\ndownstream facilities. It produces a fully diversified range of flat steel\nproducts, including value-added steel,\u00a0and has a pellet capacity of 20 million\ntonnes.\u00a0\n\nFor more than 100 years, since the first\nIndian steel plant was set up, steel has\nhelped build some of India\u2019s most remarkable\nand enduring projects. Now once again, an\nopportunity presents for our company, and\nour industry \u2013 the opportunity for our most\ndefining act yet: producing net-zero steel\nto support a net-zero economy.\n\n\nSETTING THE STAGE FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH\n\nIn his Chairman\u2019s Letter, Aditya Mittal highlights the significant strides made\nby AM/NS India since its inception at Hazira. With plans to boost annual\nproduction to 15 million tonnes, the focus is not just on expansion but on\nsustainable growth. \u201cAs our company and country grow, we also push ourselves to\nconfront a parallel challenge: decoupling development from emissions,\u201d says\nAditya Mittal.\n\n\nSTEEL: THE BACKBONE OF INDIA\u2019S DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe steel industry, integral to India\u2019s infrastructure boom, faces the challenge\nof doubling its capacity by 2030 while mitigating its environmental impact.\n\u201cSteelmaking will be integral \u2013 the backbone of the houses and highways, bridges\nand buildings that will define a more competitive manufacturing economy,\u201d Mittal\nemphasizes.\n\n\nINNOVATING TOWARDS A GREENER FUTURE\n\nAM/NS India\u2019s Climate Action Report lays out a roadmap to reduce emission\nintensity by 20% by 2030. This includes scaling up renewable energy usage,\nmaximizing scrap steel use, and investing in green hydrogen and carbon capture,\nutilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies. \u201cWe are working hard to make green\nhydrogen viable for steel and studying Indian geology to improve the feasibility\nof CCUS,\u201d Aditya Mittal states, underscoring the company\u2019s commitment to\ninnovation.\n\n\nTHE ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES\n\nThe journey to net-zero steel is fraught with economic challenges, particularly\nin India where low-carbon alternatives are costlier. Despite these challenges,\nAM/NS India remains steadfast in its commitment. Mittal remarks, \u201cThe pathway to\nnet zero has to be economically viable and the industry must remain\ncompetitive.\u201d\n\n\nA COLLABORATIVE EFFORT FOR A NET-ZERO FUTURE\n\nThe transition to net-zero steelmaking demands multi-stakeholder collaboration,\nincluding supportive policies, incentives, and investment. \u201cTransformational\nsteps by the industry, with support and leadership from the government, can\nclose the gap to net-zero steel,\u201d affirms Aditya Mittal.\n\n\nAM/NS INDIA\u2019S ROLE IN INDIA\u2019S GROWTH AND DECARBONISATION CHALLENGE\n\nGROWTH TRAJECTORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nSince commencing operations at Hazira over four years ago, AM/NS India has\nplayed a significant role in supporting India\u2019s growth trajectory, focusing on\nself-reliance and resilience. As the company aims to increase production to 15\nmillion tonnes annually, it simultaneously faces the dual challenge of fostering\neconomic development and reducing emissions.\n\nTHE LINK BETWEEN STEEL PRODUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nSteel production is integral to India\u2019s development, forming the backbone of\ninfrastructure projects. However, this necessitates a substantial increase in\nsteel capacity, potentially tripling by mid-century.

        "content": "New Delhi CNN \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n\nFor the last three decades, Peeyush Mittal has frequently driven the 185 miles\nfrom the Indian capital to the city of Jaipur. The journey always took him six\nhours.\n\n\u201cFor 30 years there\u2019s been this promise of doing that journey in three hours. It\nhas never been possible,\u201d said Mittal, a portfolio manager at\u00a0Matthews Asia, a\nSan Francisco-based investment fund. \u201cThey\u2019ve expanded the highway, gone from\none lane to two lane to three lane, everything has been done. But that journey\nhas always remained six hours.\u201d\n\nExcept last year, when he cruised at 75 miles per hour on a new expressway\nconnecting the two cities, and made the trip in half the time.\n\n\u201cMy jaw dropped when I first time got on that highway. I was like, \u2018Wow, man,\nhow is this even possible \u2026 in India?\u201d he said.\n\nThe quality of India\u2019s new infrastructure is just one of many reasons why\nMittal, who manages funds focussed on emerging markets, and other investors are\nexcited about the country\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nFinancial professionals around the world are noticing India\u2019s development since\n2014 under two-term Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has said he wants the\nSouth Asian nation to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025.\n\nThe optimism around the world\u2019s most populous nation is in stark contrast to the\nmood found in China, which is grappling with a myriad of economic challenges,\nincluding an accelerated flight of capital from the country.\n\nIts stock markets have suffered\u00a0a protracted slump\u00a0since recent peaks in 2021,\nwith more than $5 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the\nShanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong bourses. Foreign direct investment (FDI)\nplunged last year, and fell again in January, down nearly 12% compared to the\nsame month in 2023.\n\nIndia\u2019s stock market, meanwhile, is hitting record highs. The value of companies\nlisted on India\u2019s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year.\n\nThe future appears even brighter. India\u2019s market value is expected to more than\ndouble to $10 trillion by 2030, according to a Thursday report by Jefferies,\nwhich would make it \u201cimpossible for large global investors to ignore.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is a no go, so \u2026 which is the other country that can maybe replace\nChina?\u201d said Mittal. \u201cThere\u2019s no country like China other than India \u2026 in some\nform or fashion, it is the substitute that maybe the world is looking for to\ndrive growth.\u201d\n\nJapan has benefited from investors seeking an alternative to China \u2014 Tokyo\u2019s\nbenchmark index hit a new high for the first time in 34 years last week, helped\nby improving corporate profits and a weak yen. But the country is stuck in\nrecession and recently lost its position as the world\u2019s third biggest economy to\nGermany.\n\nThe latest revision by global stock index compiler MSCI reflects the bullishness\ntowards India. MSCI said this month that it would increase India\u2019s weighting in\nits emerging markets index to 18.06% from 17.98%, while reducing China\u2019s to\n24.77%.\n\nMSCI\u2019s indexes help institutional investors worldwide decide how to allocate\nmoney and where to focus their research.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s weight in\u00a0the MSCI emerging market index\u00a0was about 7% a couple of years\nback,\u201d said Aditya Suresh,\u00a0head of India equity research at Macquarie\nCapital.\u00a0\u201cDo I think that 18% [in the MSCI index] is naturally gravitating more\ntowards 25%? Yeah, that\u2019s kind of clearly where our conversations are leading us\nto believe.\u201d\n\nAs India heads towards national elections in the coming months, market watchers\nare hoping that Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wins a third term, bringing\ngreater predictability to economic policies for the next five years.\n\n\u201cIf Modi is back with a majority and political stability is there, then I can\ncertainly say with confidence that there\u2019ll be a lot more investor interest in\nIndia on a more sustainable basis,\u201d said Mittal.\n\nThere are good reasons for the euphoria around India. From a\u00a0surging young\npopulation\u00a0to humming factories, the country has a lot going in its favor.\n\nThe\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0expects India to grow by 6.5% next financial\nyear compared to 4.6% for China. Analysts at Jefferies expect the country to\nbecome the world\u2019s third largest economy by 2027.\n\nMuch like China more than three decades ago, India is only at the beginning of a\ninfrastructure transformation, spending billions on building roads, ports,\nairports and railways.\n\nThere is a \u201cvery strong multiplier effect\u201d on the economy from the investments\nin digital and physical infrastructure, which \u201cyou cannot roll back,\u201d Suresh\nsaid.\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s fastest growing major economy is also trying to capitalize on the\nrethink underway among companies on supply chains. Global businesses want to\ndiversify operations away from China, where they faced obstacles during the\npandemic and are exposed to risks arising from tension between Beijing and\nWashington.\n\n\u201cIndia is a prime candidate to benefit from the \u2018friend-shoring\u2019 of supply\nchains, notably at the expense of China,\u201d wrote Hubert de Barochez, a market\neconomist at Capital Economics, in January.\n\nAs a result, some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL)\nsupplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations in India. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon\nMusk said last June his company is looking to invest in India \u201cas soon as\nhumanly possible.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Modi] really cares about India because he\u2019s pushing us to make significant\ninvestments in India, which is something we intend to do,\u201d Musk told reporters.\n\nBut some worry that India\u2019s confidence may be bordering on hubris.\n\nWhile interest in the world\u2019s fifth largest economy is rising, the lofty prices\nof India\u2019s stocks are scaring some international investors away.\n\nIndian shares have always been expensive compared to other emerging economies,\nsaid Suresh, but now \u201cthe premium on the premium has expanded.\u201d\n\nDomestic investors, both retail and institutional, seem to be brushing aside\nthese high valuations, driving India\u2019s stock market to unprecedented peaks.\n\nAccording to Macquarie, retail investors alone own 9% of India\u2019s equity market\nvalue versus foreign investors at slightly under 20%. Analysts, however, expect\nforeign investments to pick up in the second half of 2024, once the election is\nout of the way.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another potential challenge. Despite its new economic swagger, India\ndoes not have the capacity to absorb all the money that is flowing out of China,\nwhose economy is still about five times bigger.\n\nChina \u201chas a few too many companies which are $100 and $200 billion plus [in\nvalue],\u201d Mittal said. \u201cIt is difficult to find home for that kind of chunk of\nmoney in India.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that India\u2019s sizzling rally is driven by domestic investors adds to\nthe country\u2019s strengths and reduces its dependence on foreign fund flows.\n\n\u201cIt just\u00a0massively insulates India from global dynamics,\u201d Suresh said.\n\nApart from geopolitical rifts and an uncertain economic outlook, foreign\ncompanies and investors have grown increasingly wary of domestic political risks\nin China, including the possibility of raids and detentions. Institutional\ninvestors are still very wary about buying Chinese stocks, even though many now\nlook like a bargain.\n\n\u201cThere are many good businesses in China, but with all the regulatory issues it\nbecomes very difficult to predict what they will look like in the long run,\u201d\nsaid Priyanka\u00a0Agnihotri, portfolio manager at Baltimore-based Brown Advisory.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, enjoys healthy relations with the West and other major\neconomies, and is aggressively wooing large firms to set up factories in the\ncountry.\n\nIn her budget speech in February,\u00a0Indian Finance Minister\u00a0Nirmala Sitharaman\nsaid FDI inflows since Modi first came to power in 2014 stood at nearly $600\nbillion, which is twice the amount during the previous decade.\n\n\u201cFor encouraging sustained foreign investment, we are negotiating bilateral\ninvestment treaties with our foreign partners, in the spirit of first develop\nIndia,\u201d she added.\n\nAnalysts say that it would hard to stop the economic juggernaut India has set in\nmotion, irrespective of what happens to China.\n\n\u201cEven if China comes back to the table and resolves a lot of problems, I don\u2019t\nthink India is going back into the background anymore,\u201d said Mittal. \u201cIt has\narrived.\u201d\n\nLaura He and Anna Cooban contributed to this report.",
