        "link": "https://www.farmersjournal.ie/agribusiness/news/rollercoaster-year-for-factory-prices-801370",
        "content": "No matter what the price of beef is, there is always a big range of prices paid\nbetween factories for the exact same type of animal. Based on average slaughter\nweights, up to \u20ac225 per head more was paid for R3 cows and \u20ac180 per head more\nfor O=3= steers between the highest- and lowest-paying factories that reported\nprices for at least 10 weeks last year. The smallest gap in prices paid was \u20ac71\nfor U=3= heifers.\n\nOne of the frequent warnings we give in presenting this data is to be conscious\nof how external factors may influence the prices paid. These include the likes\nof organic and speciality breeds for which factories pay a premium \u2013 if there\nare substantial numbers of these in a factory\u2019s kill, then the prices they\nreport will be inflated. Similarly, some factories pay an extra bonus to attract\ncattle in a narrow weight range, which others buy off the grid, and deals at\nflat-rate prices will often reflect higher prices for lower grades and lower\nprices for the top grades.\n\nAnother variable that can distort the picture is the effect of a factory killing\na minuscule number of cattle over the year and if these were bought at either an\nexceptionally high or exceptionally low price, they won\u2019t necessarily reflect\nthe mainstream value.\n\nTo address this, an extra column has been added to this year\u2019s league tables\nidentifying the number of weeks in the year for which prices in each particular\ngrade for each factory were reported.\n\nMain findings\n\nThe categories chosen to reflect 2023 are four different grades from steers,\nheifers, young bulls and cows.\n\nThese are U=3=, R=3=, O=3= and P+ 3= giving 16 categories overall and cover the\nvast majority of cattle that are going through Irish factories.\n\nAll the factories that reported for 2022 are still reporting in 2023. Kavanagh\nMeats Enniscorthy started price reporting during 2023 but are excluded from the\nleagues as they don\u2019t have a full year of data. Kildare Chilling is separate\nfrom the Dawn group because that deal was only concluded during the year.\n\nWhile factories outside the main groups claimed several podium positions, some\nof which were based on a small number of cattle reported, several of them\nincluding ABP, Dawn and Kepak occupied positions in top half of the table. (See\nbelow)\n\nFoyle may have had less podium positions than previous years but it was still\nthere or thereabouts and it is one of the factories that pays extra for a narrow\nweight range on steers and heifers.\n\nAshbourne pushed into the top three for O=3= steers and was a consistent buyer\nas it reported for 52 weeks in that category. It was second for P+3= young bulls\nthough with a small sample size.\n\nMoyvalley claimed a first and second place in P+3= and O=3= young bulls, while\nEurofarm was second for R=3= young bulls with Foyle top for the U=3= grade.\nLiffey claimed a third place finish in the P+3= young bull category.\n\nCows\n\nWhen it comes to cows, the top positions are dominated by factories outside the\nmain groups. C&J Meats is widely known as a strong buyer of top-quality cows and\nthis is reflected in the table where it occupies the top position for U=3= and\nR=3= cows and a second place for O=3= cows.\n\nThese are the best-quality suckler-bred cows and C&J reported on these for 46\nand 52 weeks for the U and R grading cows, respectively, in 2023.\n\nTraditional Meat Company took top position for the O=3= and P+3= cows, reporting\non 50 and 25 weeks, respectively, and a second place for the R=3= grade based on\n51 weeks reporting.\n\nLiffey is also a strong cow buyer and had two third places, with Dawn\nBallyhaunis and ABP Nenagh claiming one each.\n\nGroup performance\n\nABP has the edge on U=3= and R=3= steers and heifers though it is pipped by Dawn\nfor the O=3= grade, who are also top for the P+3= grade followed by Kepak with\nABP back in third.\n\nThe top positions are divided between the big three for young bulls but when it\ncomes to cows, when the factories outside the main groups are taken together,\nthey are the top-payers in all categories apart from P+3= grade. There were some\nexcellent cow prices paid in 2023 and this merits further analysis.\n\nFactory margins\n\nIrish beef processing is privately owned and there are no accounts published\nwith the exception of Foyle and C&J Meats whose businesses operate both sides of\nthe border and in the case of Foyle it has two abattoirs in Britain as well.\n\nDunbia, which is the UK division of Dawn Meats also publishes accounts and while\nthis is outside the Republic of Ireland, between them they will give an\nindication of the financial performance. As well as being a very limited sample,\nwe also have to note that in these cases accounts are for the 2022 financial\nyear.\n\n\n\nSuckler cows and calves.\n\n\n\nC&J has a factory outside Lifford in Co Donegal, a cutting plant in Co Armagh\nand is a stakeholder in an abattoir in Co Antrim. In the year to 30 November\n2022, it had a turnover of \u00a369.1m (\u20ac80.3m), up from \u00a358.9m (\u20ac68.5m) in 2021.\n\nOperating profit for the year was \u00a3727,025 (\u20ac845,377) and after interest and\ntaxation, profit for the year was \u00a3490,692 (\u20ac570,572). The breakdown of sales is\n\u00a337m (\u20ac43m) to the UK with \u00a332m (\u20ac37m) to Europe.\n\nDunbia, the UK division of Dawn Meats since 2020, also continues to publish\nannual accounts. It is headquartered in Dungannon Co Tyrone, where it has a beef\nand sheep abattoir, cutting plant and retail packing unit. Across the UK, it has\n13 locations and for 2022 posted a \u00a31.37bn (\u20ac1.59bn) turnover with an operating\nprofit of \u00a312.79m (\u20ac14.87m).\n\nThe Foyle Food Group has an abattoir and cutting plant located in Cargins, Co\nDonegal, and two in Northern Ireland at Lisahally, Co Derry, and Omagh, Co\nTyrone. It also has two factories in Britain. Turnover at the Foyle Food Group\nHoldings Ltd increased to \u00a3482m (\u20ac560.4m) in 2022, up from \u00a3410m (\u20ac476.7m) in\n2021 with operating profit at \u00a312.9m (\u20ac15m) compared with \u00a314.6m (\u20ac17m) the\nprevious year and net profits were \u00a39.3m (\u20ac10.8m), down from \u00a310.7m (\u20ac12.4m) in\n2021.\n\nNumbers useful for guidance and an indication of trends\n\nLooking at factory profit figures where they exist, profits that are stated in\nmultiple millions look spectacular. There is do doubt that a well-run beef\nprocessing business can be extremely profitable but when the numbers are\nanalysed in these examples, we can see that profit margins are running between\njust under 1% and 2.7%.\n\nQuestion\n\nThe other question that remains unanswered is how representative are these\nnumbers for beef processing in the Republic of Ireland?\n\nAll of the Dunbia business is UK-based as is the largest percentage of the Foyle\nbusiness and the C&J business has a significant contribution from northern\ncattle, as well as from its Donegal factory. As with the factory league tables\nfor cattle prices, these numbers are useful for guidance and an indication of\ntrends.",

        "content": "The suckler herd involved in the trial\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 in Co. Tyrone has partnered with a\nNorwegian-based agri-tech company in a new hill-farm grazing trial.\n\nThe trial is set to examine how \u2018virtual fencing\u2019 can optimise the grazing\nmanagement of a suckler herd in a hill farm setting.\n\nSpeaking to Agriland, Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke explained what the\nresearch hopes to achieve.\n\nHe explained that the project is being initially trialled on 26 cows and a\nbreeding bull. No collars are placed on the calves.\n\nThe trial will examine how effective the virtual fencing is in the hill\nlandscape where phone signal is poor.\n\nInitial indications are showing the virtual fence is effective despite the low\nsignal in the region and the farm has plans to expand the project to more cattle\nin the near future.\n\nClarke added that the \u2018virtual fence\u2019 is essentially a collar that is placed on\nthe livestock. A phone app shows the farmer where the cattle are located.\n\nL-r: Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke, Ann Elinor Aasen from Monel, Wayne\nAcheson from Foyle Food Group and Christoffer Grindheim from Monel\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here in the office and if I want to give the cattle grazing on the\nhill a fresh area to graze, I can use the technology to create a bigger grazing\nzone for the cattle to make their way into.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s free entry for the cattle to get into the zone but once they try to go\n> out of the zone they hear a noise and they get that noise three times and then\n> it goes to a shock.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a solar panel on the collars. They\u2019re charged up at the start of the\nyear and the solar panel will keep them charged for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cThe phone app will tell you what each collar battery is and if you have a\ncollar not working or the battery\u2019s not charging, it will let you know,\u201d he\noutlined.\n\nThe collars were fitted last week and have been \u201cworking well\u201d on the herd so\nfar, according to the Foyle representative.\n\nWilson Marshall from the Foyle Food Group agri-team (left) pictured with Monil\nstaff\n\nClarke said: \u201cThere\u2019s two reasons we wanted to trial the collars. Firstly, we\nwant to better manage the grazing of the cattle on the hill.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the cattle to graze areas of the hill where they wouldn\u2019t\nnormally go as a group.\n\n> \u201cSecondly, whenever we\u2019re serving cows with a bull on the hill, sometimes the\n> cows could be on one end of the hill and the bull could be on the other. The\n> cow could be cycling and the bull would never see her within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the virtual fencing is to keep the livestock batched and moved\nacross the hill. We hope to be able to basically rotationally graze the hill.\nThat\u2019s what were trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe fence can be managed from a smartphone\n\nThe Norwegian-based company involved in the trial with Foyle is \u2018Monil\u2019.\n\nAccording to their website, Monil is \u201ca startup [business] challenging\ntraditional fences with our innovative virtual fencing technology, allowing\nanimals to roam freely while giving farmers complete control over their herd\u2019s\nlocation and well-being\u201d.\n\n\nFOYLE FARM\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 is located in Co. Tyrone and the\noverall farming operation encompasses 1,100ac of land. 570ac of this is\nmountain-type ground, 250ac is lowland grazing and the rest is lowland silage\nground.\n\nThe farm is continuously conducting research and trials with the aim of\nproviding practical and up-to-date information to Foyle\u2019s beef suppliers on ways\nto further improve the economic and environmental sustainability of their farms.\n\nSome of the areas on which the farm is currently conducting research includes\nbest practice on grassland management, soil health, animal nutrition, and\nbedding for livestock.\n\nMore information on the farm can be found here.",

        "link": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp",
        "content": "WHAT IS AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY?\n\nAn emerging market economy is the economy of a developing nation that's becoming\nmore engaged with global markets as it grows. Countries classified as emerging\nmarket economies are those with some but not all of the characteristics of a\ndeveloped market.\n\nCharacteristics of developed markets can include strong economic growth, high\nper capita income, liquid equity and debt markets, accessibility by foreign\ninvestors, and a dependable regulatory system.\n\nIt typically becomes more integrated with the global economy as an emerging\nmarket economy develops. It can have increased liquidity in local debt and\nequity markets, increased trade volume, and foreign direct investment. It can\ndevelop modern financial and regulatory institutions. Some notable emerging\nmarket economies include India, Mexico, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and\nBrazil.\n\nAn emerging market economy is transitioning from a low-income, less developed,\noften pre-industrial economy toward a modern, industrial economy with a higher\nstandard of living.\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * An emerging market economy is one that's transitioning into a developed\n   economy.\n * Emerging market economies typically feature a unified currency, stock market,\n   and banking system. They're in the process of industrializing.\n * Emerging market economies can offer greater returns to investors due to their\n   rapid growth.\n * They also offer greater exposure to some inherent risks due to their status.\n * Emerging markets typically adopt reforms that are seen in developed markets\n   over time.\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY\n\nInvestors seek emerging markets for the prospect of high returns because these\nmarkets often experience faster economic growth as measured by gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Higher returns usually come with much greater risk, however.\n\n\nRISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS\n\nRisks can include political instability, domestic infrastructure problems,\ncurrency volatility, and illiquid equity because many large companies may still\nbe state-run or private. Local stock exchanges might not offer liquid markets to\noutside investors.\n\nEmerging markets generally don't have highly developed market and regulatory\ninstitutions like those found in developed nations. Market efficiency and strict\nstandards in accounting and securities regulation are generally not on par with\nadvanced economies such as those of the United States, Europe, and Japan.\n\n\nSIGNS OF PROGRESS\n\nEmerging markets typically have a physical financial infrastructure, including\nbanks, a stock exchange, and a unified currency. A key aspect of emerging market\neconomies is that they adopt reforms and institutions like those of modern\ndeveloped countries over time. This promotes economic growth.\n\nEmerging market economies tend to move away from activities that are focused on\nagricultural and resource extraction toward industrial and manufacturing\nactivities instead. Their governments usually pursue deliberate industrial and\ntrade strategies to encourage economic growth and industrialization. These\nstrategies include export-led growth and import-substituting industrialization.\n\nExport-led growth is more typical of economies that are considered emerging\nbecause it promotes more engagement and trade with the global economy. Emerging\nmarket countries also often pursue domestic programs such as investing in\neducational systems, building physical infrastructure, and enacting legal\nreforms to secure investors' property rights.\n\n\nFRONTIER MARKETS\n\nFrontier markets are usually smaller than emerging markets with lower per capita\nincome, less market liquidity, and less industrialization. They offer attractive\ninvestment opportunities but frontier markets are considered riskier for\ninvestors than emerging markets.\n\n\nHOW EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES ARE CLASSIFIED\n\nEmerging market economies are classified in various ways. Levels of income,\nquality of financial systems, and growth rates are all popular criteria but the\nexact list of emerging market economies can vary depending on who you ask.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) classifies 20 countries as emerging\nmarkets. Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) classifies 24 countries as\nemerging markets. Standard and Poor's (S&P), FTSE Russell, and Dow Jones also\nvary slightly in their classification of countries as emerging markets.\n\nA country can be removed from the list by either upgrading it to developed\nnation status or downgrading it to a frontier nation at any of these\ninstitutions' discretion. Developed nations may likewise be downgraded to an\nemerging market as was the case with Greece. Frontier markets such as Qatar and\nArgentina may be upgraded to emerging markets.\n\n\nWHAT'S AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY?\n\nAn emerging market economy is generally considered an economy that's\ntransitioning into a developed market economy. It has rapid GDP growth, growing\nper capita income, increasing debt and equity markets liquidity, and an\nestablished financial system infrastructure.\n\n\nWHAT COUNTRIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EMERGING MARKETS?\n\nClassifications differ but the so-called BRICS countries represent five emerging\nmarkets with major economic growth and opportunities for investment: Brazil,\nRussia, India, China, and South Africa. The GDPs of these countries have\nincreased steadily from 2000 through 2023. Data for 2024 isn't yet available.\n\nThat trend is expected to continue through the years ahead.\n\n\nDO EMERGING MARKETS MAKE GOOD INVESTMENTS?\n\nThey can make good investments due to their propensity for rapid GDP growth\ncompared to more mature markets but investing in emerging markets can be risky\ndue to potential political instability, lack of dependable information, currency\nfluctuations, lower liquidity, and investment volatility.\n\nInvestors should carefully weigh potential risks and rewards before making any\ninvestment.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nCountries that are classified as emerging market economies are those with\neconomies that are transitioning into being developed. They have a unified\ncurrency, stock market, and banking system, and they're in the process of\nindustrializing.\n\nEmerging market economies can be attractive to investors due to their rapid\ngrowth and greater returns but they also involve greater exposure and risk due\nto political instability or currency fluctuation.",
        "summary": "An emerging market economy is transitioning from a low-income, less developed, pre-industrial economy toward a modern, industrial economy. It typically becomes more integrated with the global economy as it develops. It can have increased liquidity in local debt and equity markets, increased trade volume, and foreign direct investment.",

        "content": "UNDERSTANDING THE DIVIDEND DYNAMICS OF NWWDF\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd () recently announced a of $0.2 per share, payable\non 2024-04-18, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-03-20. As investors look\nforward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's\ndividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's\ndelve into New World Development Co Ltd's dividend performance and assess its\nsustainability.\n\n\nWHAT DOES NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD DO?\n\n * \n * \n\n * This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years\n\n * How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nNew World Development, or NWD, is the listed property arm of Chow Tai Fook,\nowned by the Cheng family. Chow Tai Fook owns a 45% stake in NWD, which mainly\nengages in residential property development and investment properties of retail\nmalls and offices in Hong Kong and mainland China. NWD also develops high-end\nhotels across Hong Kong, mainland China, and in Southeast Asia. Additionally,\nNWD holds a 75% interest in New World Department Store China, which operates 24\ndepartment stores in mainland China.\n\n\n\n\nA GLIMPSE AT NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND HISTORY\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd has maintained a consistent record since 1999.\nDividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart\nshowing annual for tracking historical trends.\n\n\nBREAKING DOWN NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND YIELD AND GROWTH\n\nAs of today, New World Development Co Ltd currently has a 12-month of 8.09% and\na 12-month of 4.26%. This suggests an expectation of decreased dividend payments\nover the next 12 months.\n\nOver the past three years, New World Development Co Ltd's annual was -1.30%.\nExtended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 1.20% per year. And over\nthe past decade, New World Development Co Ltd's annual dividends per share\ngrowth rate stands at 3.10%.\n\nBased on New World Development Co Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth\nrate, the of New World Development Co Ltd stock as of today is approximately\n8.59%.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY QUESTION: PAYOUT RATIO AND PROFITABILITY\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the\ncompany's payout ratio. The provides insights into the portion of earnings the\ncompany distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company\nretains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of\nfunds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, New World\nDevelopment Co Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 2.77, which may suggest that the\ncompany's dividend may not be sustainable.\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd's , offers an understanding of the company's\nearnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks New World Development Co\nLtd's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability\nprospects. The company has reported positive for each year over the past decade,\nfurther solidifying its high profitability.\n\n\nGROWTH METRICS: THE FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth\nmetrics. New World Development Co Ltd's of 7 out of 10 suggests that the\ncompany's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and New World Development Co Ltd's ,\ncombined with the , indicates a strong revenue model. New World Development Co\nLtd's revenue has increased by approximately 17.90% per year on average, a rate\nthat outperforms approximately 75.09% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical\ncomponent for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years,\nNew World Development Co Ltd's earnings increased by approximately 17.30% per\nyear on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 68.78% of global\ncompetitors.\n\nLastly, the company's of -35.80%, which outperforms approximately 4.42% of\nglobal competitors, presents a mixed picture but does not overshadow the\ncompany's overall strong performance.\n\n\nENGAGING CONCLUSION: EVALUATING NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND\nPROSPECTS\n\nIn conclusion, New World Development Co Ltd's upcoming dividend payment, along\nwith its historical dividend performance, presents an interesting case for\ninvestors. While the dividend growth rate and high yield on cost are attractive,\nthe low payout ratio raises questions about the dividend's sustainability.\nHowever, the company's solid profitability and positive growth metrics provide\nconfidence in its ability to sustain dividends. Investors should weigh these\nfactors carefully and consider New World Development Co Ltd's overall financial\nhealth when making investment decisions. Will the company continue to reward\nshareholders with consistent dividend payments? Only time will tell.\n\nGuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the .\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights\nand is not tailored financial advice.

        "link": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/mckinseys-private-markets-annual-review",
        "content": "AT A GLANCE\n\n\nMACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES CONTINUED\n\nIf 2022 was a tale of two halves, with robust fundraising and deal activity in\nthe first six months followed by a slowdown in the second half, then 2023 might\nbe considered a tale of one whole. Macroeconomic headwinds persisted throughout\nthe year, with rising financing costs, and an uncertain growth outlook taking a\ntoll on private markets. Full-year fundraising continued to decline from 2021\u2019s\nlofty peak, weighed down by the \u201cdenominator effect\u201d that persisted in part due\nto a less active deal market. Managers largely held onto assets to avoid selling\nin a lower-multiple environment, fueling an activity-dampening cycle in which\ndistribution-starved limited partners (LPs) reined in new commitments.\n\nPerformance in most private asset classes remained below historical averages for\na second consecutive year. Decade-long tailwinds from low and falling interest\nrates and consistently expanding multiples seem to be things of the past. As\nprivate market managers look to boost performance in this new era of investing,\na deeper focus on revenue growth and margin expansion will be needed now more\nthan ever.\n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL FUNDRAISING CONTRACTED\n\nFundraising fell 22 percent across private market asset classes globally to just\nover $1 trillion, as of year-end reported data\u2014the lowest total since 2017.\nFundraising in North America, a rare bright spot in 2022, declined in line with\nglobal totals, while in Europe, fundraising proved most resilient, falling just\n3 percent. In Asia, fundraising fell precipitously and now sits 72 percent below\nthe region\u2019s 2018 peak.\n\nDespite difficult fundraising conditions, headwinds did not affect all\nstrategies or managers equally. Private equity (PE) buyout strategies posted\ntheir best fundraising year ever, and larger managers and vehicles also fared\nwell, continuing the prior year\u2019s trend toward greater fundraising\nconcentration.\n\n\nTHE NUMERATOR EFFECT PERSISTED\n\nDespite a marked recovery in the denominator\u2014the 1,000 largest US retirement\nfunds grew 7 percent in the year ending September 2023, after falling 14 percent\nthe prior year, for example1\u2014many LPs remain overexposed to private markets\nrelative to their target allocations. LPs started 2023 overweight: according to\nanalysis from CEM Benchmarking, average allocations across PE, infrastructure,\nand real estate were at or above target allocations as of the beginning of the\nyear. And the numerator grew throughout the year, as a lack of exits and\nrebounding valuations drove net asset values (NAVs) higher. While not all LPs\nstrictly follow asset allocation targets, our analysis in partnership with\nglobal private markets firm StepStone Group suggests that an overallocation of\njust one percentage point can reduce planned commitments by as much as 10 to 12\npercent per year for five years or more.\n\nDespite these headwinds, recent surveys indicate that LPs remain broadly\ncommitted to private markets. In fact, the majority plan to maintain or increase\nallocations over the medium to long term.\n\n\nINVESTORS FLED TO KNOWN NAMES AND LARGER FUNDS\n\nFundraising concentration reached its highest level in over a decade, as\ninvestors continued to shift new commitments in favor of the largest fund\nmanagers. The 25 most successful fundraisers collected 41 percent of aggregate\ncommitments to closed-end funds (with the top five managers accounting for\nnearly half that total). Closed-end fundraising totals may understate the extent\nof concentration in the industry overall, as the largest managers also tend to\nbe more successful in raising non-institutional capital.\n\nWhile the largest funds grew even larger\u2014the largest vehicles on record were\nraised in buyout, real estate, infrastructure, and private debt in 2023\u2014smaller\nand newer funds struggled. Fewer than 1,700 funds of less than $1 billion were\nclosed during the year, half as many as closed in 2022 and the fewest of any\nyear since 2012. New manager formation also fell to the lowest level since 2012,\nwith just 651 new firms launched in 2023.\n\nWhether recent fundraising concentration and a spate of M&A activity signals the\nbeginning of oft-rumored consolidation in the private markets remains uncertain,\nas a similar pattern developed in each of the last two fundraising downturns\nbefore giving way to renewed entrepreneurialism among general partners (GPs) and\ncommitment diversification among LPs. Compared with how things played out in the\nlast two downturns, perhaps this movie really is different, or perhaps we\u2019re\nwatching a trilogy reusing a familiar plotline.\n\n\nDRY POWDER INVENTORY SPIKED (AGAIN)\n\nPrivate markets assets under management totaled $13.1 trillion as of June 30,\n2023, and have grown nearly 20 percent per annum since 2018. Dry powder\nreserves\u2014the amount of capital committed but not yet deployed\u2014increased to $3.7\ntrillion, marking the ninth consecutive year of growth. Dry powder inventory\u2014the\namount of capital available to GPs expressed as a multiple of annual\ndeployment\u2014increased for the second consecutive year in PE, as new commitments\ncontinued to outpace deal activity. Inventory sat at 1.6 years in 2023, up\nmarkedly from the 0.9 years recorded at the end of 2021 but still within the\nhistorical range. NAV grew as well, largely driven by the reluctance of managers\nto exit positions and crystallize returns in a depressed multiple environment.\n\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY STRATEGIES DIVERGED\n\nBuyout and venture capital, the two largest PE sub-asset classes, charted wildly\ndifferent courses over the past 18 months. Buyout notched its highest\nfundraising year ever in 2023, and its performance improved, with funds posting\na (still paltry) 5 percent net internal rate of return through September 30. And\nalthough buyout deal volumes declined by 19 percent, 2023 was still the\nthird-most-active year on record. In contrast, venture capital (VC) fundraising\ndeclined by nearly 60 percent, equaling its lowest total since 2015, and deal\nvolume fell by 36 percent to the lowest level since 2019. VC funds returned \u20133\npercent through September, posting negative returns for seven consecutive\nquarters. VC was the fastest-growing\u2014as well as the highest-performing\u2014PE\nstrategy by a significant margin from 2010 to 2022, but investors appear to be\nreevaluating their approach in the current environment.\n\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY ENTRY MULTIPLES CONTRACTED\n\nPE buyout entry multiples declined by roughly one turn from 11.9 to 11.0 times\nEBITDA, slightly outpacing the decline in public market multiples (down from\n12.1 to 11.3 times EBITDA), through the first nine months of 2023. For nearly a\ndecade leading up to 2022, managers consistently sold assets into a\nhigher-multiple environment than that in which they had bought those assets,\nproviding a substantial performance tailwind for the industry. Nowhere has this\nbeen truer than in technology. After experiencing more than eight turns of\nmultiple expansion from 2009 to 2021 (the most of any sector), technology\nmultiples have declined by nearly three turns in the past two years, 50 percent\nmore than in any other sector. Overall, roughly two-thirds of the total return\nfor buyout deals that were entered in 2010 or later and exited in 2021 or before\ncan be attributed to market multiple expansion and leverage. Now, with falling\nmultiples and higher financing costs, revenue growth and margin expansion are\ntaking center stage for GPs.\n\n\nREAL ESTATE RECEDED\n\nDemand uncertainty, slowing rent growth, and elevated financing costs drove cap\nrates higher and made price discovery challenging, all of which weighed on deal\nvolume, fundraising, and investment performance. Global closed-end fundraising\ndeclined 34 percent year over year, and funds returned \u22124 percent in the first\nnine months of the year, losing money for the first time since the 2007\u201308\nglobal financial crisis. Capital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies\nas investors sought liquidity via redemptions in open-end vehicles, from which\nnet outflows reached their highest level in at least two decades. Opportunistic\nstrategies benefited from this shift, with investors focusing on capital\nappreciation over income generation in a market where alternative sources of\nyield have grown more attractive. Rising interest rates widened bid\u2013ask spreads\nand impaired deal volume across food groups, including in what were formerly hot\nsectors: multifamily and industrial.\n\n\nPRIVATE DEBT PAYS DIVIDENDS\n\nDebt again proved to be the most resilient private asset class against a\nturbulent market backdrop. Fundraising declined just 13 percent, largely driven\nby lower commitments to direct lending strategies, for which a slower PE deal\nenvironment has made capital deployment challenging. The asset class also posted\nthe highest returns among all private asset classes through September 30. Many\nprivate debt securities are tied to floating rates, which enhance returns in a\nrising-rate environment. Thus far, managers appear to have successfully\nnavigated the rising incidence of default and distress exhibited across the\nbroader leveraged-lending market. Although direct lending deal volume declined\nfrom 2022, private lenders financed an all-time high 59 percent of leveraged\nbuyout transactions last year and are now expanding into additional strategies\nto drive the next era of growth.\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE TOOK A DETOUR\n\nAfter several years of robust growth and strong performance, infrastructure and\nnatural resources fundraising declined by 53 percent to the lowest total since\n2013. Supply-side timing is partially to blame: five of the seven largest\ninfrastructure managers closed a flagship vehicle in 2021 or 2022, and none of\nthose five held a final close last year. As in real estate, investors shied away\nfrom core and core-plus investments in a higher-yield environment. Yet there are\nreasons to believe infrastructure\u2019s growth will bounce back. Limited partners\n(LPs) surveyed by McKinsey remain bullish on their deployment to the asset\nclass, and at least a dozen vehicles targeting more than $10 billion were\nactively fundraising as of the end of 2023. Multiple recent acquisitions of\nlarge infrastructure GPs by global multi-asset-class managers also indicate\nmarketwide conviction in the asset class\u2019s potential.\n\n\nPRIVATE MARKETS STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON DIVERSITY\n\nPrivate markets firms are slowly improving their representation of females (up\ntwo percentage points over the prior year) and ethnic and racial minorities (up\none percentage point). On some diversity metrics, including entry-level\nrepresentation of women, private markets now compare favorably with corporate\nAmerica. Yet broad-based parity remains elusive and too slow in the making.\nEthnic, racial, and gender imbalances are particularly stark across more\ninfluential investing roles and senior positions. In fact, McKinsey\u2019s\nresearch\u00a0reveals that at the current pace, it would take several decades for\nprivate markets firms to reach gender parity at senior levels. Increasing\nrepresentation across all levels will require managers to take fresh approaches\nto hiring, retention, and promotion.\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GENERATING EXCITEMENT\n\nThe transformative potential of generative AI was perhaps 2023\u2019s hottest topic\n(beyond Taylor Swift). Private markets players are excited about the potential\nfor the technology to optimize their approach to thesis generation, deal\nsourcing, investment due diligence, and portfolio performance, among other\nareas. While the technology is still nascent and few GPs can boast scaled\nimplementations, pilot programs are already in flight across the industry,\nparticularly within portfolio companies. Adoption seems nearly certain to\naccelerate throughout 2024.\n\nIf private markets investors entered 2023 hoping for a return to the heady days\nof 2021, they likely left the year disappointed. Many of the headwinds that\nemerged in the latter half of 2022 persisted throughout the year, pressuring\nfundraising, dealmaking, and performance. Inflation moderated somewhat over the\ncourse of the year but remained stubbornly elevated by recent historical\nstandards. Interest rates started high and rose higher, increasing the cost of\nfinancing. A reinvigorated public equity market recovered most of 2022\u2019s losses\nbut did little to resolve the valuation uncertainty private market investors\nhave faced for the past 18 months.\n\nWithin private markets, the denominator effect remained in play, despite the\npublic market recovery, as the numerator continued to expand. An\nactivity-dampening cycle emerged: higher cost of capital and lower multiples\nlimited the ability or willingness of general partners (GPs) to exit positions;\nfewer exits, coupled with continuing capital calls, pushed LP allocations\nhigher, thereby limiting their ability or willingness to make new commitments.\nThese conditions weighed on managers\u2019 ability to fundraise. Based on data\nreported as of year-end 2023, private markets fundraising fell 22 percent from\nthe prior year to just over $1 trillion, the largest such drop since 2009\n(Exhibit 1).\n\nThe impact of the fundraising environment was not felt equally among GPs.\nContinuing a trend that emerged in 2022, and consistent with prior downturns in\nfundraising, LPs favored larger vehicles and the scaled GPs that typically\nmanage them. Smaller and newer managers struggled, and the number of sub\u2013$1\nbillion vehicles and new firm launches each declined to its lowest level in more\nthan a decade.\n\nDespite the decline in fundraising, private markets assets under management\n(AUM) continued to grow, increasing 12 percent to $13.1 trillion as of June 30,\n2023. 2023 fundraising was still the sixth-highest annual haul on record,\npushing dry powder higher, while the slowdown in deal making limited\ndistributions.\n\nInvestment performance across private market asset classes fell short of\nhistorical averages. Private equity (PE) got back in the black but generated the\nlowest annual performance in the past 15 years, excluding 2022. Closed-end real\nestate produced negative returns for the first time since 2009, as\ncapitalization (cap) rates expanded across sectors and rent growth dissipated in\nformerly hot sectors, including multifamily and industrial. The performance of\ninfrastructure funds was less than half of its long-term average and even\nfurther below the double-digit returns generated in 2021 and 2022. Private debt\nwas the standout performer (if there was one), outperforming all other private\nasset classes and illustrating the asset class\u2019s countercyclical appeal.\n\n\n\nHigher financing costs, lower multiples, and an uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment created a challenging backdrop for private equity managers in 2023.\nFundraising declined for the second year in a row, falling 15 percent to $649\nbillion, as LPs grappled with the denominator effect and a slowdown in\ndistributions. Managers were on the fundraising trail longer to raise this\ncapital: funds that closed in 2023 were open for a record-high average of 20.1\nmonths, notably longer than 18.7 months in 2022 and 14.1 months in 2018. VC and\ngrowth equity strategies led the decline, dropping to their lowest level of\ncumulative capital raised since 2015. Fundraising in Asia fell for the fourth\nyear of the last five, with the greatest decline in China.\n\nDespite the difficult fundraising context, a subset of strategies and managers\nprevailed. Buyout managers collectively had their best fundraising year on\nrecord, raising more than $400 billion. Fundraising in Europe surged by more\nthan 50 percent, resulting in the region\u2019s biggest haul ever. The largest\nmanagers raised an outsized share of the total for a second consecutive year,\nmaking 2023 the most concentrated fundraising year of the last decade (Exhibit\n2).\n\nDespite the drop in aggregate fundraising, PE assets under management increased\n8 percent to $8.2 trillion. Only a small part of this growth was performance\ndriven: PE funds produced a net IRR of just 2.5 percent through September 30,\n2023. Buyouts and growth equity generated positive returns, while VC lost money.\nPE performance, dating back to the beginning of 2022, remains negative,\nhighlighting the difficulty of generating attractive investment returns in a\nhigher interest rate and lower multiple environment. As PE managers devise value\ncreation strategies to improve performance, their focus includes ensuring\noperating efficiency and profitability of their portfolio companies.\n\nDeal activity volume and count fell sharply, by 21 percent and 24 percent,\nrespectively, which continued the slower pace set in the second half of 2022.\nSponsors largely opted to hold assets longer rather than lock in underwhelming\nreturns. While higher financing costs and valuation mismatches weighed on\noverall deal activity, certain types of M&A gained share. Add-on deals, for\nexample, accounted for a record 46 percent of total buyout deal volume last\nyear.\n\n\n\nFor real estate, 2023 was a year of transition, characterized by a litany of new\nand familiar challenges. Pandemic-driven demand issues continued, while elevated\nfinancing costs, expanding cap rates, and valuation uncertainty weighed on\ncommercial real estate deal volumes, fundraising, and investment performance.\n\nManagers faced one of the toughest fundraising environments in many years.\nGlobal closed-end fundraising declined 34 percent to $125 billion. While\nfundraising challenges were widespread, they were not ubiquitous across\nstrategies. Dollars continued to shift to large, multi-asset class platforms,\nwith the top five managers accounting for 37 percent of aggregate closed-end\nreal estate fundraising. In April, the largest real estate fund ever raised\nclosed on a record $30 billion.\n\nCapital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies as investors sought\nliquidity through redemptions in open-end vehicles and reduced gross\ncontributions to the lowest level since 2009. Opportunistic strategies benefited\nfrom this shift, as investors turned their attention toward capital appreciation\nover income generation in a market where alternative sources of yield have grown\nmore attractive.\n\nIn the United States, for instance, open-end funds, as represented by the\nNational Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Fund Index\u2014Open-End\nEquity (NFI-OE), recorded $13 billion in net outflows in 2023, reversing the\ntrend of positive net inflows throughout the 2010s. The negative flows mainly\nreflected $9 billion in core outflows, with core-plus funds accounting for the\nremaining outflows, which reversed a 20-year run of net inflows.\n\nAs a result, the NAV in US open-end funds fell roughly 16 percent year over\nyear. Meanwhile, global assets under management in closed-end funds reached a\nnew peak of $1.7 trillion as of June 2023, growing 14 percent between June 2022\nand June 2023.\n\nReal estate underperformed historical averages in 2023, as previously\nhigh-performing multifamily and industrial sectors joined office in producing\nnegative returns caused by slowing demand growth and cap rate expansion.\nClosed-end funds generated a pooled net IRR of \u22123.5 percent in the first nine\nmonths of 2023, losing money for the first time since the global financial\ncrisis. The lone bright spot among major sectors was hospitality, which\u2014thanks\nto a rush of postpandemic travel\u2014returned 10.3 percent in 2023.2 As a whole, the\naverage pooled lifetime net IRRs for closed-end real estate funds from 2011\u201320\nvintages remained around historical levels (9.8 percent).\n\nGlobal deal volume declined 47 percent in 2023 to reach a ten-year low of $650\nbillion, driven by widening bid\u2013ask spreads amid valuation uncertainty and\nhigher costs of financing (Exhibit 3).3 Deal flow in the office sector remained\ndepressed, partly as a result of continued uncertainty in the demand for space\nin a hybrid working world.\n\n\n\nDuring a turbulent year for private markets, private debt was a relative bright\nspot, topping private markets asset classes in terms of fundraising growth, AUM\ngrowth, and performance.\n\nFundraising for private debt declined just 13 percent year over year, nearly ten\npercentage points less than the private markets overall. Despite the decline in\nfundraising, AUM surged 27 percent to $1.7 trillion. And private debt posted the\nhighest investment returns of any private asset class through the first three\nquarters of 2023.\n\nPrivate debt\u2019s risk/return characteristics are well suited to the current\nenvironment. With interest rates at their highest in more than a decade, current\nyields in the asset class have grown more attractive on both an absolute and\nrelative basis, particularly if higher rates sustain and put downward pressure\non equity returns (Exhibit 4). The built-in security derived from debt\u2019s\nprivileged position in the capital structure, moreover, appeals to investors\nthat are wary of market volatility and valuation uncertainty.\n\nDirect lending continued to be the largest strategy in 2023, with fundraising\nfor the mostly-senior-debt strategy accounting for almost half of the asset\nclass\u2019s total haul (despite declining from the previous year). Separately,\nmezzanine debt fundraising hit a new high, thanks to the closings of three of\nthe largest funds ever raised in the strategy.\n\nOver the longer term, growth in private debt has largely been driven by\ninstitutional investors rotating out of traditional fixed income in favor of\nprivate alternatives. Despite this growth in commitments, LPs remain underweight\nin this asset class relative to their targets. In fact, the allocation gap has\nonly grown wider in recent years, a sharp contrast to other private asset\nclasses, for which LPs\u2019 current allocations exceed their targets on average.\nAccording to data from CEM Benchmarking, the private debt allocation gap now\nstands at 1.4 percent, which means that, in aggregate, investors must commit\nhundreds of billions in net new capital to the asset class just to reach current\ntargets.\n\nPrivate debt was not completely immune to the macroeconomic conditions last\nyear, however. Fundraising declined for the second consecutive year and now sits\n23 percent below 2021\u2019s peak. Furthermore, though private lenders took share in\n2023 from other capital sources, overall deal volumes also declined for the\nsecond year in a row. The drop was largely driven by a less active PE deal\nenvironment: private debt is predominantly used to finance PE-backed companies,\nthough managers are increasingly diversifying their origination capabilities to\ninclude a broad new range of companies and asset types.\n\n\n\nFor infrastructure and natural resources fundraising, 2023 was an exceptionally\nchallenging year. Aggregate capital raised declined 53 percent year over year to\n$82 billion, the lowest annual total since 2013. The size of the drop is\nparticularly surprising in light of infrastructure\u2019s recent momentum. The asset\nclass had set fundraising records in four of the previous five years, and\ninfrastructure is often considered an attractive investment in uncertain\nmarkets.\n\nWhile there is little doubt that the broader fundraising headwinds discussed\nelsewhere in this report affected infrastructure and natural resources\nfundraising last year, dynamics specific to the asset class were at play as\nwell. One issue was supply-side timing: nine of the ten largest infrastructure\nGPs did not close a flagship fund in 2023. Second was the migration of investor\ndollars away from core and core-plus investments, which have historically\naccounted for the bulk of infrastructure fundraising, in a higher rate\nenvironment.\n\nThe asset class had some notable bright spots last year. Fundraising for\nhigher-returning opportunistic strategies more than doubled the prior year\u2019s\ntotal (Exhibit 5). AUM grew 18 percent, reaching a new high of $1.5 trillion.\nInfrastructure funds returned a net IRR of 3.4 percent in 2023; this was below\nhistorical averages but still the second-best return among private asset\nclasses. And as was the case in other asset classes, investors concentrated\ncommitments in larger funds and managers in 2023, including in the largest\ninfrastructure fund ever raised.\n\nThe outlook for the asset class, moreover, remains positive. Funds targeting a\nrecord amount of capital were in the market at year-end, providing a robust\nfoundation for fundraising in 2024 and 2025. A recent spate of infrastructure GP\nacquisitions signal multi-asset managers\u2019 long-term conviction in the asset\nclass, despite short-term headwinds. Global megatrends like decarbonization and\ndigitization, as well as revolutions in energy and mobility, have spurred new\ninfrastructure investment opportunities around the world, particularly for\nvalue-oriented investors that are willing to take on more risk.\n\n\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become an important part of the\nfundraising, talent, and investing landscape for private market participants.\nEncouragingly, incremental progress has been made in recent years, including\nmore diverse talent being brought to entry-level positions, investing roles, and\ninvestment committees. The scope of DEI metrics provided to institutional\ninvestors during fundraising has also increased in recent years: more than half\nof PE firms now provide data across investing teams, portfolio company boards,\nand portfolio company management (versus investment team data only).4\n\nIn 2023, McKinsey surveyed 66 global private markets firms that collectively\nemploy more than 60,000 people for the second annual State of diversity in\nglobal private markets report.5 The research offers insight into the\nrepresentation of women and ethnic and racial minorities in private investing as\nof year-end 2022. In this chapter, we discuss where the numbers stand and how\nfirms can bring a more diverse set of perspectives to the table.\n\nThe statistics indicate signs of modest advancement. Overall representation of\nwomen in private markets increased two percentage points to 35 percent, and\nethnic and racial minorities increased one percentage point to 30 percent\n(Exhibit 6). Entry-level positions have nearly reached gender parity, with\nfemale representation at 48 percent. The share of women holding C-suite roles\nglobally increased 3 percentage points, while the share of people from ethnic\nand racial minorities in investment committees increased 9 percentage points.\nThere is growing evidence that external hiring is gradually helping close the\ndiversity gap, especially at senior levels. For example, 33 percent of external\nhires at the managing director level were ethnic or racial minorities, higher\nthan their existing representation level (19 percent).\n\nYet, the scope of the challenge remains substantial. Women and minorities\ncontinue to be underrepresented in senior positions and investing roles. They\nalso experience uneven rates of progress due to lower promotion and higher\nattrition rates, particularly at smaller firms. Firms are also navigating an\nincreasingly polarized workplace today, with additional scrutiny and a growing\nnumber of lawsuits against corporate diversity and inclusion programs,\nparticularly in the US, which threatens to impact the industry\u2019s pace of\nprogress.\n\n\n\nFredrik Dahlqvist is a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s Stockholm office; Alastair\nGreen\u00a0is a senior partner in the Washington, DC, office, where Paul Maia and\nAlexandra Nee\u00a0are partners; David Quigley\u00a0is a senior partner in the New York\noffice, where Connor Mangan is an associate partner and Aditya Sanghvi\u00a0is a\nsenior partner; Rahel Schneider is an associate partner in the Bay Area office;\nJohn Spivey is a partner in the Charlotte office; and Brian Vickery\u00a0is a partner\nin the Boston office.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Jonathan Christy, Louis Dufau, Vaibhav Gujral, Graham\nHealy-Day, Laura Johnson, Ryan Luby, Tripp Norton, Alastair Rami, Henri Torbey,\nand Alex Wolkomir for their contributions\n\nThe authors would also like to thank CEM Benchmarking and the StepStone Group\nfor their partnership in this year's report.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis article was edited by Arshiya Khullar, an editor in the Gurugram office.\n\nEXPLORE A CAREER WITH US",

        "content": "A view of the NEV production line of BYD in Rayong, Thailand.\u00a0SUN WEITONG/XINHUA\n\nAt Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor's welding workshop in Rayong, Thailand,\nnumerous robotic arms in operation indicate the level of high-tech in use even\nas Chinese technicians guide local employees through the welding process.\n\nFollowing the successful rollout of its first electric vehicle at its plant in\nThailand this January, the Baoding, Hebei province-based carmaker said that\nmultiple batches of Thai workers have now mastered the production processes of\nits EV products. They have thus become valuable assets for the company, aiding\nits expansion efforts in other Southeast Asian markets.\n\nElsewhere, Beijing-based artificial intelligence services provider Terminus\nGroup is charting a similar course to bring additional value to an overseas\nmarket. Amid the intensified efforts by many Middle Eastern countries to\nleverage the digital economy for sustainable growth, Terminus launched its\ninternational headquarters in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, in February.\n\nIt will not only facilitate Terminus' projects and business expansion\ninitiatives in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and other countries in the\nregion, but also support the group's operations in Singapore, Australia and\nnumerous countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBoth GWM and Terminus are epitomes of a larger trend \u2014 that of Chinese\nenterprises operating in the vast BRI landscape going beyond big-ticket\ninfrastructure projects like dams, highways, railroads, airports and municipal\nengineering works.\n\nAs many parts of the world enter a new phase of development, Chinese companies,\nparticularly those from high-end manufacturing and trade in services, are\nadjusting their strategies to better align with the evolving environment in BRI\neconomies, said Wan Zhe, a researcher at the Belt and Road School of Beijing\nNormal University.\n\nFacing challenges like escalating geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism\nin certain countries, Chinese enterprises are focusing on avoiding risks and\ngenerating revenue through higher-value business ventures that serve the\nchanging landscape better, said Wan.\n\nFor instance, GWM plans to start operations at its new factories in Vietnam,\nIndonesia and Malaysia this year or the next.\n\nSimilarly, Chang'an Automobile Co, a Chongqing-based State-owned automaker, is\nbuilding a factory in Rayong province, Thailand. The first phase of the project\nwill involve an investment of over $240 million and is scheduled to begin\nproduction in 2025.\n\nEmployees work on a battery production line of BYD in Brazil.\u00a0WANG\nTIANCONG/XINHUA\n\nThe new energy vehicles produced will be not only marketed in Thailand but also\nexported to other neighboring ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)\ncountries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and South\nAfrica, said Shen Xinghua, president of Chang'an Automobile's business for\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nShen said that the initial annual production capacity of this plant is 100,000\nunits, which will be gradually expanded to 200,000 units in the next phase.\n\nChen Bin, deputy director of an expert committee at the Beijing-based China\nMachinery Industry Federation, said that South Africa, Hungary, Saudi Arabia,\nIndonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia have all formulated EV-related policies to\nencourage and support the development and growth of the industry.\n\nHighlighting that electrification and intelligence complement each other, Chen\nsaid with growing populations in many countries, particularly in Africa and\nSoutheast Asia, an increasing number of young consumers who prefer smart\ntechnologies are emerging, making these markets more proactive in embracing EVs.\n\nHis observation reflects a trend. China's NEVs are becoming popular in overseas\nmarkets thanks to their quality, driving range and multifunctionality.\n\nSome 519,000 EVs and plug-in hybrids were exported from China between January\nand May, up 13.7 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile\nManufacturers.\n\nChina's continuous efforts to enhance institutional opening-up and secure\nhigh-standard economic and free trade agreements, alongside the swift expansion\nof its tech-intensive green product industries, are anticipated to propel its\ncompanies to strategically invest in new plants, service centers and innovation\nfacilities in markets involved in the BRI, said Yu Jianlong, vice-chairman of\nthe Beijing-headquartered China Council for the Promotion of International\nTrade.\n\nIn addition to automakers such as SAIC Motor, Beijing Automotive Group,\nGuangzhou Automobile Group and BYD, Chinese battery and component manufacturers,\nincluding Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, Gotion High-tech Co Ltd and\nEVE Energy Co Ltd, have invested in BRI economies to supply products to their\ndomestic partners and create jobs for local communities.\n\nRecognizing this trend, Matthias Loebich, partner and leader for international\nbusiness at Bearing-Point, a European management and technology consultancy with\nmore than 10,000 employees across 70 countries and regions, said that China's\nfast-growing EV sector will continue to lead the world's green transition and\ncreate enormous growth opportunities for upstream and downstream industries in\nthe BRI landscape.\n\n\"This is evident in our doubling of Chinese automotive clients seeking\nconsulting support over the past two years,\" said Loebich, noting that Chinese\nautomakers are enhancing their internal capabilities in management, digital\ntransformation and overseas strategies, learning from advanced markets to\nelevate their global presence.\n\nThe company established a dedicated team to help Chinese automakers conduct\nsustainability-related activities in both home and global markets in 2023, in\norder to further enhance their growth strength.\n\nCollectively, such moves have had a positive effect on official data. China's\nnonfinancial outbound direct investment came in at $60.2 billion in the first\nfive months, up 16.3 percent year-on-year, statistics from the Ministry of\nCommerce showed.\n\nChina's cooperation with countries and regions participating in the BRI\ncontinued to show growth momentum as ODI in these economies came in at $12.81\nbillion, up nearly 13 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe value of trade between China and BRI economies was worth 8.31 trillion yuan\n($1.14 trillion) during the January-May period, up 7.2 percent year-on-year,\ndata from the General Administration of Customs showed.\n\nSuch a rise will likely be sustained given certain strategic Chinese corporate\nmoves. For instance, in late June, Chinese train maker CRRC Corp, driven by its\nproduct upgrade and technology accumulation, unveiled seven new energy\nlocomotives in Beijing, to offer the world new solutions for green, low-carbon\ndevelopment in rail transport. These will enrich CRRC Corp's overall product\nofferings. This marked a notable step forward in green transition efforts in\nboth domestic and global markets.\n\nLin Cunzeng, CRRC's vice-president, said the development of this series of new\nenergy locomotives is a concrete step to promote the renewal and upgrade of\noutdated equipment in both home and foreign markets, and advance the green and\nlow-carbon transformation of rail transit equipment.\n\n\"They will contribute to the high-quality growth of the BRI and enrich China's\nexport content,\" said Lin.\n\nThese new locomotives, he said, will drive the demand for diverse new energy\nproducts like power batteries and hydrogen energy power packs. They will,\ntherefore, stimulate the development of upstream industries like basic materials\nand core components, fostering new drivers of economic growth.\n\nThe current reshaping of the global supply chain has generated new avenues for\nChinese companies to match their capabilities with shifting market needs, said\nLyu Yue, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies, part of the\nUniversity of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"Showing strong competitiveness, Chinese companies excel in industries like new\nenergy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic products,\" said Lyu,\nadding this has resulted in increased acceptance and collaboration from many\ncountries involved in the BRI.\n\nAgreed Michael Dyke, CEO of the Riyadh-based New Murabba Development Co, a\nbusiness unit of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Dyke said that the\ntangible growth of the BRI and enhanced Sino-Saudi business relations will\nattract more Chinese companies to expand their market presence in Saudi Arabia.\n\nNew Murabba Development is responsible for building a modern town in Riyadh.

        "content": "WHAT IS A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION?\n\nA multinational corporation (MNC) is a company that has business operations in\nat least one country other than its home country and generates revenue beyond\nits borders. Chances are the clothes you're wearing, the smartphone in your\npocket, and the transportation you take to work all have one thing in common:\nthey were likely manufactured by an MNC, as are 90% of American imports.\n\nMultinationals permeate nearly every aspect of our modern lives while wielding a\nstaggering influence politically and economically, with more than a quarter of\nAmerican workers employed by one. The first multinationals were colonial\nenterprises. The East India Company (formed 1600), Dutch East India Company\n(VOC; 1602), and the Hudson Bay Colony (HBC, 1649) stand out as central to\nimperialist histories whose rapaciousness still haunts anyone with even the\nvaguest sense of history. Remarkably, HBC endures, as does its core business\nmodel, sourcing clothing and other materials\u2014while holding massive amounts of\nreal estate\u2014in one part of the world to sell finished goods to Western\nconsumers.\n\nThe MNCs formed more recently have often not equipped themselves much better:\nJust 57 multinationals were responsible for unleashing 80% of global carbon\nemissions between 2016 and 2022. Yet, despite their ubiquity in what we wear and\neven the air we breathe, there is still widespread confusion about what defines\na company as \"multinational.\" Is it simply having offices or factories overseas?\nSelling products internationally? Or is there more to it?\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * A multinational corporation (MNC) has business operations in at least two\n   countries, often with headquarters in one country and subsidiaries,\n   manufacturing plants, and offices in other nations.\n * MNCs have expanded rapidly in recent decades because of falling trade\n   barriers, the search for new markets, expanding global supply chains, and\n   outsourcing operations to lower-cost regions.\n * Multinational corporations can bring benefits like job creation,\n   infrastructure investment, and improved quality of goods in the countries\n   where they operate, but many are known for disreputable tax, environmental,\n   and labor practices.\n * Well-known examples of multinational corporations include Apple Inc. (AAPL),\n   Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), Nestle SA (NSRGY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM),\n   and Coca-Cola Co. (KO).\n\nMultinationals have fundamentally shaped the flow of capital, goods, and\nservices in a world that they helped connect, perhaps more than any military,\nduring the centuries-long process of globalization. Their incredible economic\nclout has also sparked heated debates around their power, labor practices,\nenvironmental impacts, and tax avoidance strategies. In this article, we take\nyou through their history, organizational structures, and complex role in\nglobalization.\n\nInvestopedia / Jessica Olah\n\n\nHOW A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION WORKS\n\nMNCs operate in at least two countries, with significant business activities and\ninvestments spanning across national borders. Their rise can be traced to the\n1600s and colonialism, though the modern corporation took shape with the\nemergence of large-scale industries such as oil, automobiles, and consumer goods\nin the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Companies like Standard Oil, Ford,\nand Coca-Cola were among the forerunners in expanding their operations globally\nwhile amassing revenues on par with entire nations.\n\nLater, the post-World War II era saw their accelerated growth, driven by trade\nliberalization, advances in shipping and other technologies, and the increasing\ninterconnectedness of global markets.\n\nVinci SA, the French multinational construction firm, had the most subsidiaries\nworldwide, at 2,689. In second place is HCA Healthcare, the U.S. pharmaceutical\nand healthcare giant, with 2,447.\n\nBut what are they? These companies take different forms, from giant\nconglomerates with diverse portfolios to specialized firms focusing on specific\nindustries or regions. Here are the main points about their structure:\n\n * Definition: MNCs are often formally defined as business entities with one or\n   more foreign affiliates in which the parent company holds at least a 10%\n   ownership stake. Most foreign affiliates are 100% owned by their parents.\n * Structure: MNCs typically consist of a parent company headquartered in one\n   country, with subsidiaries, branches, or joint ventures in multiple host\n   countries. The parent company maintains strategic control over its global\n   operations, setting overall goals, policies, and standards. Subsidiaries are\n   separate legal entities in the countries where they operate.\n * Governance: MNCs often have centralized management, with the most important\n   decisions made at the headquarters. However, some adopt a more decentralized\n   approach, giving regional or country-specific management teams greater\n   autonomy. MNCs may also have a matrix-like structure, where employees report\n   to both functional (e.g. marketing, finance) and geographic managers (e.g.\n   country or regional heads).\n\nThe foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of multinational corporations\nincreased by over 106 times between 1970 and 2023, from $13 billion to $1.37\ntrillion.\n\nThe specific organizational design of MNCs depends on where they are and their\nindustry. Though the two terms are often used interchangeably, multinational\nenterprises (MNEs) and MNCs are different. MNEs are entities that engage in\nforeign direct investment (FDI) and own or control production or material\ndevelopment firms in more than one country. This is a very broad definition for\na reason: MNEs include corporations, partnerships, state-run enterprises, and\nother types of business structures. MNEs can be private or state-owned and may\noperate in various sectors, such as manufacturing, services, or extractive\nindustries. MNCs are a specific type of MNE that takes the form of a\ncorporation. In sum, while all MNCs are MNEs, not all MNEs are MNCs.\n\nDeveloping an international presence can open up new markets where\nmultinationals can sell goods or produce the same quality of products at lower\ncosts. MNCs can thus reduce prices and increase the purchasing power of\nconsumers worldwide. They may also take advantage of lower tax rates in\ncountries eager for FDI, and critics point to their propensity for developing\nmonopolies where they operate. This can drive up prices, squelch competition,\nand inhibit innovation.\n\nCharacteristics of a Multinational Corporation Characteristic Description\nBenefits Challenges Examples Global Reach Operates and has a significant market\npresence in multiple countries. Access to diverse markets Navigating different\nregulations Coca-Cola, operating in over 200 countries and territories. Diverse\nOperations Engages in a wide range of business activities across different\nindustries and sectors. Diversification of risk and new markets Potential\noverextension Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (SSNLF), involved in electronics,\nconstruction, shipbuilding, and financial services. Intricate Business Structure\nMaintains a complicated business model and organizational structure to manage\nglobal operations.

Brand Recognition\nTypically have strong brand recognition and global marketing strategies. Enables\nMNCs to command premium prices and foster customer loyalty Maintaining a\nconsistent and positive brand image across different cultures and regulatory\nenvironments can be challenging and costly McDonald's Corp. (MCD), with its\niconic golden arches recognized worldwide. International Taxation Pays taxes in\nmultiple countries, navigating different statutory tax rates. Potential tax\nsavings through optimization Complex tax compliance, risk of penalties Starbucks\nCorp. (SBUX) has faced scrutiny controversy for using complex tax structures to\nshift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Financial Reporting Standards Reports\nfinancial information according to International Financial Reporting Standards.\nTransparency, comparability across borders Adhering to different accounting\nstandards Siemens AG (SIEGY), the German conglomerate, must adhere to diverse\nfinancial reporting standards across across jurisdictions.\n\n\nTYPES OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS\n\n * Decentralized corporation: This type of MNC maintains a presence in its home\n   country and has autonomous offices and other facilities globally. Each office\n   manages the local business itself, making its own decisions.\n * Centralized global corporation: A central headquarters is located in the home\n   country. Executive officers and management manage the overseas offices and\n   operations, as well as domestic operations. The subsidiaries must get\n   approval from headquarters for significant activities.\n * International division of a corporation: This is the part of an MNC\n   responsible for all global operations. They can function independently of\n   domestic operations, which can pose problems when overall corporate consensus\n   and action are required.\n * Transnational corporation: A parent-subsidiary structure in which the parent\n   company oversees the operations of subsidiaries in foreign countries and the\n   home country. Subsidiaries can use the parent's assets, such as research and\n   development data. Subsidiaries may be different brands. Though differentiated\n   in the past, the term is now virtually synonymous with MNCs.\n\n\nMULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS\n\nThe post-World War II era saw a significant acceleration in the growth of MNCs,\nfueled by advances in transportation, shipping, communication, and trade\nliberalization. The rise of global brands like Coca-Cola, International Business\nMachines Corporation (IBM), and McDonald's exhibited the growing reach and\ninfluence of MNCs.\n\nThese global entities had the power to shape economies, industries, and\nsocieties across borders, making them a force to be reckoned with in the modern\nworld. For critics, it seemed that as the armies of Europe receded from their\ncolonies, MNCs stepped in to take their place.\n\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MNCS\n\nSpanning continents and with the ability to mobilize resources larger than many\nnations' annual revenues, MNCs can drive economic growth and development for\nmillions. Multinationals have attracted praise for their benefits to economic\ngrowth and criticism for their potential to exert undue influence over so-called\n\"host\" countries\u2014those nations where their subsidiaries set up shop.\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and other economists generally credit MNCs'\npositive contributions to global development. Among the most significant is\ntheir ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), which can inject\nmuch-needed capital, technology, and expertise into an economy.\n\nThe most common method of FDI is when a multinational acquires a local firm, but\nit can include foreign joint ventures, constructing new plants, and reinvesting\nearnings in a foreign subsidiary. Given the natural involvement of MNCs in these\ninvestments, it's an indirect measure of their spread into new markets.\nAccording to the World Bank, total FDI inflows to developing countries were\n$1.37 trillion in 2023.\n\nTypically, economists analyze inflows for specific nations to see if MNCs and\nothers are finding a country a good place to invest. The more FDI coming into a\ncountry, the more jobs it can produce and the more taxes it can collect. FDI\ninflows don't include portfolio investments like buying bonds, stocks, and other\nassets in a foreign country without gaining ownership control.\n\nFor decades, the IMF argued for countries to increase their FDI inflows through\nlower taxes and less regulation (hence shrinking the size of the state), which\nits economists typically couch in the moral language of \"macroeconomic\ndiscipline.\" As such, for much of the post-colonial period, the IMF and other\nmultinational organizations have been pushing developing economies to attract\nMNCs to set up shop there, making FDI the most capital flows into less-developed\ncountries for the decades after decolonization.\n\n\nCRITIQUES OF MNCS\n\nHowever, this push for increased FDI has not been without its critics,\nparticularly those in developing countries. MNC influence has raised complex\nquestions about the role of foreign investment, the distribution of benefits,\nand popular and local sovereignty. Once an MNC moves into an area, it can often\nsideline local industries and then use its monopolistic hold to gain significant\npolitical influence in the country. Then, in moves reminiscent, for some, of the\nflows of capital during the era of state colonialism, the profits might be\nrepatriated by MNCs to their home country, limiting the benefits of FDI for host\ncountries. These issues have led to various responses from host governments,\nincluding protests, restrictions, exclusion, and even expropriation of MNCs.\n\nMeanwhile, it's become clear that many MNCs aren't returning their funds to\nwhere they're headquartered. As a percentage of GDP, the highest FDI inflows\naren't into the U.S. or newly opened markets but tax havens like the Cayman\nIslands, which have no corporate income, capital gains, or payroll taxes.\u00a0This\nmakes it an attractive destination for multinational corporations to park funds\nto minimize their taxes to the countries where that wealth was earned.\n\nCritiques of MNCs tend to fall under the following categories:\n\n * Environmental devastation: MNCs have been accused of prioritizing profits\n   over environmental protection, leading to deforestation, pollution, and\n   unsustainable resource extraction in the pursuit of cheap inputs.\n * Labor exploitation: Critics point to poor working conditions, low wages, and\n   lack of worker rights in many places where MNCs operate, amounting to a race\n   to the bottom in labor standards among the countries competing for FDI\n   inflows.\n * Tax avoidance: Countries worldwide lose billions in tax revenues due to\n   aggressive tax planning strategies MNCs use to shift profits to low-tax\n   jurisdictions.\n * Crowding out local businesses: The market power and economies of scale of\n   large MNCs make it difficult for local firms to compete, stifling local\n   entrepreneurs.\n * Political blackmail: Some argue that the IMF and World Bank's policy\n   prescriptions to attract FDI, such as deregulation and austerity, undermine\n   governments' ability to invest in public services and protect national\n   interests. However, giving up FDI would mean turning away funds needed for\n   local development, leading to Faustian bargains for many developing\n   countries.\n\n\nTHE SLOWDOWN IN FDI FLOWS\n\nBelow is a chart of the global FDI inflows as a percentage of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) in recent decades. As you can see, the percentage spikes at the\nturn of the millennium, during the financial crisis, and then immediately after.\nThis indicates a substantial increase in the flow of foreign capital into\neconomies worldwide, reflecting a growing interest from multinational\ncorporations and investors in expanding their operations and investments abroad.\nIt could also, of course, suggest moments when capital flowed abroad, when there\nwas significant volatility in the home markets. The largest FDI inflows occur\ninto the U.S. and other developed economies.\n\n\nDeveloping countries have encouraged FDI\u2014that is, the expansion of MNCs\u2014to\nfinance infrastructure and create new jobs for local workers. For their part,\nthe MNCs gain from FDI by expanding further into international markets.\n\nSeveral factors are said to drive increases in FDI inflows, a measure of MNC\nexpansion beyond their home countries' borders:\n\n * Economic liberalization: Many countries have opened up their economies to\n   foreign investment by reducing trade barriers, easing restrictions on capital\n   flows, and creating more favorable investment climates.\n * Technological advances: Improvements in communication and transportation have\n   made it easier for companies to operate across borders and manage global\n   supply chains.\n * Emerging markets: The rapid growth of emerging markets has created new\n   prospects for foreign investors seeking higher returns in relatively untapped\n   markets.\n * Financial globalization: The increasing integration of financial markets has\n   made cross-border capital flows possible and made it easier for investors to\n   invest in foreign projects.\n\nGlobal FDI flows have declined significantly as a share of GDP from around 3.3%\nin the 2000s to only 1.5% or so in recent years, and this drop has\ndisproportionately affected emerging markets. While FDI flows to developed\ncountries like the U.S. increased by 29% in 2023, flows to developing countries\ndecreased by 9%.\u00a0\n\nWhile the percentages and acronyms thrown around in many of these discussions\ncan seem abstract, the consequences are not. These represent millions of jobs,\nthe aspirations of local and regional economies, and massive inequalities\nworldwide that keep poverty entrenched in some regions of the globe.\n\nThe political stakes couldn't be higher. The terms economists use for the recent\ndrop in FDI flows include \"global economic fragmentation,\" which suggests a\nmovement away from a previous era's economic integration and globalization. The\ntrade wars between the U.S. and China, the pandemic, rising nationalism, and\nregional wars have upended earlier investment patterns, just as they have\nbillions of lives. We seem to have entered a new chapter, perhaps, in the\nhistory of the multinational corporation.\n\n\n\nWHY WOULD A BUSINESS WANT TO BECOME A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY?\n\nUsually, a business's primary goal is to increase profits and growth. If it can\ngrow a global customer base and increase its market share abroad, it may believe\nopening offices in foreign countries is worth the expense and effort. Companies\nmay benefit from certain tax structures or regulatory regimes found abroad.\n\n\nHOW DO MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS INFLUENCE GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES?\n\nMNCs greatly affect trade policies through lobbying efforts and economic\ndiplomacy. They advocate for trade agreements and regulations that favor their\nbusiness operations, often helping to shape policies to reduce tariffs, improve\nmarket access, and protect intellectual property rights. MNCs leverage their\neconomic might to negotiate favorable terms with governments, influencing\ninternational trade to attain environments conducive to their growth.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME RISKS MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS FACE?\n\nMultinational corporations are exposed to risks related to the different\ncountries and regions in which they operate. These can include regulatory or\nlegal risks, political instability, crime and violence, cultural sensitivities,\nand fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nMultinational corporations are as influential as any stakeholders in the global\neconomy, with the potential to drive economic growth and development in the\ncountries where they operate. However, their impact on host countries,\nparticularly in the developing world, is not without controversy. While MNCs can\nbring valuable foreign direct investment, technology, and expertise, they also\nraise concerns about exploitation, loss of sovereignty, and uneven distribution\nof benefits.\n\nAs global FDI flows decline, especially in developing countries, policymakers,\nbusinesses, and civil society must work together to create a more balanced and\nequitable framework for international investment. Ultimately, the role of MNCs\nin global development is complex and constantly evolving, shaped by the actions\nand decisions of countless stakeholders worldwide.",

        "content": "We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart\nproductivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. Yet it\ncould also replace jobs and deepen inequality.\n\nThe rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated the world, causing\nboth excitement and alarm, and raising important questions about its potential\nimpact on the global economy. The net effect is difficult to foresee, as AI will\nripple through economies in complex ways. What we can say with some confidence\nis that we will need to come up with a set of policies to safely leverage the\nvast potential of AI for the benefit of humanity.\n\nReshaping the Nature of Work\n\nIn a new analysis, IMF staff examine the potential impact of AI on the global\nlabor market. Many studies have predicted the likelihood that jobs will be\nreplaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases AI is likely to complement human\nwork. The IMF analysis captures both these forces.\n\nThe findings are striking: almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to\nAI. Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect\nroutine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact\nhigh-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from\nAI\u2014but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits\u2014compared with emerging\nmarket and developing economies.\n\nIn advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly\nhalf the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity.\nFor the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by\nhumans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced\nhiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.\n\nIn emerging markets and low-income countries, by contrast, AI exposure is\nexpected to be 40 percent and 26 percent, respectively. These findings suggest\nemerging market and developing economies face fewer immediate disruptions from\nAI. At the same time, many of these countries don\u2019t have the infrastructure or\nskilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over\ntime the technology could worsen inequality among nations.\n\n\n\nAI could also affect income and wealth inequality within countries. We may see\npolarization within income brackets, with workers who can harness AI seeing an\nincrease in their productivity and wages\u2014and those who cannot falling behind.\nResearch\u00a0shows that AI can help less experienced workers enhance their\nproductivity more quickly. Younger workers may find it easier to exploit\nopportunities, while older workers could struggle to adapt.\n\nThe effect on labor income will largely depend on the extent to which AI will\ncomplement high-income workers. If AI significantly complements higher-income\nworkers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase in their labor income.\nMoreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI will likely boost\ncapital returns, which may also favor high earners. Both of these phenomena\ncould exacerbate inequality.\n\nIn most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend\nthat policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from\nfurther stoking social tensions. It is crucial for countries to establish\ncomprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programs for vulnerable\nworkers. In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting\nlivelihoods and curbing inequality.\n\nAn Inclusive AI-Driven World\n\nAI is being integrated into businesses around the world at remarkable speed,\nunderscoring the need for policymakers to act.\n\nTo help countries craft the right policies, the IMF has developed an AI\nPreparedness Index that measures readiness in areas such as digital\ninfrastructure, human-capital and labor-market policies, innovation and economic\nintegration, and regulation and ethics.\n\nThe human-capital and labor-market policies component, for example, evaluates\nelements such as years of schooling and job-market mobility, as well as the\nproportion of the population covered by social safety nets. The regulation and\nethics component assesses the adaptability to digital business models of a\ncountry\u2019s legal framework and the presence of strong governance for effective\nenforcement.\n\nUsing the index, IMF staff assessed the readiness of 125 countries. The findings\nreveal that wealthier economies, including advanced and some emerging market\neconomies, tend to be better equipped for AI adoption than low-income countries,\nthough there is considerable variation across countries. Singapore, the United\nStates and Denmark posted the highest scores on the index, based on their strong\nresults in all four categories tracked.\n\n\n\nGuided by the insights from the AI Preparedness Index, advanced economies should\nprioritize AI innovation and integration while developing robust regulatory\nframeworks. This approach will cultivate a safe and responsible AI environment,\nhelping maintain public trust. For emerging market and developing economies, the\npriority should be laying a strong foundation through investments in digital\ninfrastructure and a digitally competent workforce.\n\nThe AI era is upon us, and it is still within our power to ensure it brings\nprosperity for all.\n\n\u2014For more on artificial intelligence and the economy, see the December issue\u00a0of\nFinance & Development, the IMF\u2019s quarterly magazine.\n\n",

        "content": "Insiders were net sellers of China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited's (HKG:2319 )\nstock during the past year. That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to\nlong-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what\ninsiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\n\nCHINA MENGNIU DAIRY INSIDER TRANSACTIONS OVER THE LAST YEAR\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the\nExecutive Vice-Chairman, Minfang Lu, sold HK$13m worth of shares at a price of\nHK$26.33 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's\nmore concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort\nthat this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price,\nwhich is HK$14.76. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at\ncurrent levels. The only individual insider seller over the last year was\nMinfang Lu.\n\nMinfang Lu sold a total of 634.00k shares over the year at an average price of\nCN\u00a526.40.

(Hint: Most of them are flying\nunder the radar).\n\n\nINSIDER OWNERSHIP\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your\nview of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider\nownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests.\nIt appears that China Mengniu Dairy insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth\nabout HK$84m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere,\nbut these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the\nother shareholders.\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES THIS DATA SUGGEST ABOUT CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY INSIDERS?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded China Mengniu Dairy\nshares in the last quarter. Still, the insider transactions at China Mengniu\nDairy in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But we do like the fact\nthat insiders own a fair chunk of the company. In addition to knowing about\ninsider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing\nChina Mengniu Dairy.

        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next\nmulti-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed\n(ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed.\nPut simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are\ncontinually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However,\nafter investigating China Mengniu Dairy (HKG:2319), we don't think it's current\ntrends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\n\nRETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE): WHAT IS IT?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much\npre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in\nits business. To calculate this metric for China Mengniu Dairy, this is the\nformula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total\nAssets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.066 = CN\u00a55.5b \u00f7 (CN\u00a5115b - CN\u00a533b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to\nDecember 2023).\n\nTherefore, China Mengniu Dairy has an ROCE of 6.6%. In absolute terms, that's a\nlow return and it also under-performs the Food industry average of 8.6%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nSEHK:2319 Return on Capital Employed July 14th 2024\n\nIn the above chart we have measured China Mengniu Dairy's prior ROCE against its\nprior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you\ncan check out the forecasts from the analysts covering China Mengniu Dairy for\nfree.\n\n\nTHE TREND OF ROCE\n\nIn terms of China Mengniu Dairy's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly\ndemand attention. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at\naround 6.6% and the business has deployed 100% more capital into its operations.\nThis poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in\ncapital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into\nhigh return investments.\n\n\nOUR TAKE ON CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY'S ROCE\n\nIn summary, China Mengniu Dairy has simply been reinvesting capital and\ngenerating the same low rate of return as before. And investors appear hesitant\nthat the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 50% in the last five\nyears. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger\ndiscussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more\nluck elsewhere.\n\nLike most companies, China Mengniu Dairy does come with some risks, and we've\nfound 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of\ncompanies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The\nstate-owned company held the largest share of the domestic milk market until\n2014. Mengniu Dairy became the first dairy products maker to be included on the\nHang Seng Index in 2014.\n\nIn August 1999, Mengniu Dairy was established as a private company in Hohhot,\nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In 2009, however, China National Cereals,\nOils and Foodstuffs (COFCO), China's largest state-owned agricultural\nconglomerate, acquired a stake in the company, becoming its biggest shareholder.\nIt listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) in June 2004.

In 2008, it was revealed that milk\npowder manufactured by Chinese dairy company Sanlu Group was contaminated with\nthe toxic chemical melamine. Mengniu Dairy's milk powder was also found to be\ntainted with the substance, shaking the Chinese public's sense of safety\nregarding domestic milk powder.\n\nIt plans to expand its business overseas. In April, the company announced its\nstrategic alliance with Shanghai Disney Resort, scheduled to open in the spring\nof 2016. It aims to increase its name recognition among overseas visitors by\nselling its own-brand milk and ice cream, along with other products, at the\ntheme park.",

        "content": "When close to half the companies in Hong Kong have price-to-earnings ratios (or\n\"P/E's\") below 8x, you may consider China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited\n(HKG:2319) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 15.4x P/E ratio. Although, it's\nnot wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why\nit's so lofty.\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy could be doing better as its earnings have been going\nbackwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings\ngrowth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this\npoor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise\nyou're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nSEHK:2319 Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry March 26th 2024\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report\non China Mengniu Dairy will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\n\nDOES GROWTH MATCH THE HIGH P/E?\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market\nfor P/E ratios like China Mengniu Dairy's to be considered reasonable.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits\nfell to the tune of 22%. However, a few very strong years before that means that\nit was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 41% in total over the last three\nyears. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going,\nshareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest\nearnings should grow by 16% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the\nrest of the market is forecast to expand by 15% per year, which is not\nmaterially different.\n\nIn light of this, it's curious that China Mengniu Dairy's P/E sits above the\nmajority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly\naverage growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock.\nThese shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E\nfalls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.\n\n\nTHE FINAL WORD\n\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within\ncertain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\n\nWe've established that China Mengniu Dairy currently trades on a higher than\nexpected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market.\nWhen we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the\nshare price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places\nshareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an\nunnecessary premium.\n\nBefore you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for China\nMengniu Dairy that you should be aware of.\n\nYou might be able to find a better investment than China Mengniu Dairy.

        "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about.\nWhat we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the\nsmart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a\nvery important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many\nother companies China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) makes use of\ndebt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\n\nWHAT RISK DOES DEBT BRING?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying\noff its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't\nfulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with\nnothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a\ncompany must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under\ncontrol. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any\nnegative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first\nlook at cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\n\nHOW MUCH DEBT DOES CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY CARRY?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that\nChina Mengniu Dairy had CN\u00a536.2b of debt in December 2023, down from CN\u00a538.0b,\none year before. However, it does have CN\u00a513.7b in cash offsetting this, leading\nto net debt of about CN\u00a522.6b.\n\nSEHK:2319 Debt to Equity History April 30th 2024\n\n\nHOW HEALTHY IS CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY'S BALANCE SHEET?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, China Mengniu Dairy had\nliabilities of CN\u00a532.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of CN\u00a532.0b due\nbeyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had CN\u00a513.7b in cash and CN\u00a512.5b in\nreceivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum\nof its cash and (near-term) receivables by CN\u00a538.4b.\n\nThis is a mountain of leverage relative to its market capitalization of\nCN\u00a559.8b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company\nneeded to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its\nnet debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and\namortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by\nits interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the\nabsolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.7, which signals significant\ndebt, but is still pretty reasonable for most types of business. However, its\ninterest coverage of 1k is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on\nthe debt is currently quite low. One way China Mengniu Dairy could vanquish its\ndebt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around\n18%, as it did over the last year. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet\nis the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the\nbusiness will decide if China Mengniu Dairy can strengthen its balance sheet\nover time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report\nshowing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept\ncold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free\ncash flow. Over the most recent three years, China Mengniu Dairy recorded free\ncash flow worth 63% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow\nexcludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when\nit wants to.\n\n\nOUR VIEW\n\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for China Mengniu\nDairy was the fact that it seems able to cover its interest expense with its\nEBIT confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging.\nFor instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to handle its total\nliabilities. Considering this range of data points, we think China Mengniu Dairy\nis in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think\ndebt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt\nlevels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all\ninvestment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. We've identified\n1 warning sign with China Mengniu Dairy , and understanding them should be part\nof your investment process.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a\nrock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks\nwithout delay.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

While many\nwould remain nervous, there could be further gains if the business can put its\nbest foot forward.\n\nIt's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in\nlockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some\ndisparity between the two. So let's do just that.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett\ndescribed how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a\nbusiness. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to\nlook at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per\nshare (EPS).\n\nDuring the unfortunate three years of share price decline, China Mengniu Dairy\nactually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 11% per year. This is quite\na puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share\nprice. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has\ndisappointed.\n\nSince the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share\nprice, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.\n\nWe note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 7.4% annual rate,\nso that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. It's probably worth\ninvestigating China Mengniu Dairy further; while we may be missing something on\nthis analysis, there might also be an opportunity.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you\nclick on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nSEHK:2319 Earnings and Revenue Growth May 21st 2024\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage,\nsuggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to\ncheck out what analysts think China Mengniu Dairy will earn in the future (free\nanalyst consensus estimates)\n\n\nA DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE\n\nInvestors in China Mengniu Dairy had a tough year, with a total loss of 45%\n(including dividends), against a market gain of about 7.1%. Even the share\nprices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the\nfundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably,\nlast year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total\nloss of 7% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said\ninvestors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that\ninvestors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find\nit very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for\nbusiness performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other\ninformation, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for China\nMengniu Dairy that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued\nsmall caps that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market\nweighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Hong Kong exchanges.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Revenue rose 6.5 percent\nto CNY98.6 billion (USD13.6 billion).\n\nGrowth slowed in China\u2019s dairy industry last year amid an excess supply of raw\nmilk, and Mengniu stored the excess, resulting in asset impairment, Lu Minfang,\nwho was promoted to vice chairman from president yesterday, said on the firm\u2019s\nearnings conference call.\n\nAnother factor was greater competition, which led to higher sales costs, Lu\nnoted.\n\nVice President Gao Fei will take over as the new president, Mengniu said. Lu was\npresident for seven years and will remain as an executive director.\n\nGao, 47, joined Mengniu when it was set up in 1999 and was promoted to vice\npresident and head of the firm\u2019s core room temperature business group in 2016.\n\nLu instituted changes in Mengniu\u2019s supply chain, talent system, and digital\noperations during his tenure as president, boosting the firm\u2019s business\nsignificantly, Song Liang, a dairy industry analyst, told Yicai.\u00a0\n\nMengniu likely chose Gao as the new president because of his wealth of frontline\nexperience, which will help the firm better respond to the increased market\ncompetition, he added.\n\nEditors: Dou Shicong, Tom Litting",

        "content": "On the evening of June 12, Shanghai-based Miaoke Landuo Food Technology Co.,\nLtd. (600882.SH, referred to as \"Miaoke Landuo\") announced that it would acquire\n100% equity in Inner Mongolia Mengniu Cheese Co., Ltd. (referred to as \"Mengniu\nCheese\") from its controlling shareholder, Inner Mongolia Mengniu Dairy (Group)\nCo., Ltd. (referred to as \"Mengniu\"), for 448 million yuan in cash.\n\nBoth Miaoke Landuo and Mengniu Cheese are subsidiaries of Mengniu. This\nadjustment represents Mengniu's restructuring of its cheese business segment,\nconsolidating the cheese operations under the listed company Miaoke Landuo to\nresolve issues of internal competition. Miaoke Landuo stated that this move aims\nto leverage the advantages of both entities, enhance quality and efficiency, and\npromote coordinated development, ultimately boosting the listed company's\nprofitability and core competitiveness.\n\nAccording to Miaoke Landuo's disclosure, Mengniu Cheese's annual revenue exceeds\n1.2 billion yuan but remains loss-making. The transaction did not bolster Miaoke\nLanduo's stock price, which fell on June 13, with a market value of 6.815\nbillion yuan.\n\nNotably, Miaoke Landuo was once a \"star stock\" in the dairy industry, with\nsignificant performance growth driving its stock price above 80 yuan per share\nin May 2021. Since 2020, Mengniu has repeatedly acquired Miaoke Landuo shares at\nhigh valuations. Now, this decision has resulted in a paper loss for Mengniu,\nand the investment return is under market scrutiny.\n\nThe roots of this acquisition trace back to 2021. In July 2021, after Miaoke\nLanduo issued private shares to Mengniu, Mengniu became its controlling\nshareholder. Due to overlapping and competitive businesses, Mengniu promised to\ninject its cheese operations, including related raw material trade, into Miaoke\nLanduo within two years. This commitment was later extended to be fulfilled by\nJuly 9 of this year, with shareholder approval.\n\nAs per Miaoke Landuo's announcement, as of December 31, 2023, the audited book\nvalue of Mengniu Cheese's consolidated balance sheet stood at 438 million yuan.\nIncluding government subsidies and other factors, the transaction price was set\nat 448 million yuan. Miaoke Landuo stated it would use its own or self-raised\nfunds for the acquisition, without directly or indirectly using raised funds.\n\nEstablished in December 2018, Mengniu Cheese currently operates two wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries engaged in cheese production: Tianjin Aishireen Dairy Products Co.,\nLtd. and Aishireen Dairy Products Import and Export Co., Ltd. According to the\nannouncement, Mengniu Cheese's revenue in 2023 was 1.273 billion yuan, with a\nnet loss attributable to the parent company of 3.373 million yuan. In the first\nquarter of 2024, it reported revenue of 211 million yuan and a net loss of 2.952\nmillion yuan.\n\nIn 2023, Miaoke Landuo's revenue was 4.049 billion yuan, a year-on-year decline\nof 16.16%, with net profit at 63.4395 million yuan, down 53.9%. In the first\nquarter of 2024, revenue was 950 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 7.14%,\nwith net profit at 41.2975 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 70.63%.\n\nMiaoke Landuo's focus on cheese coincided with a hot segment in the dairy\nindustry. After specializing in cheese, the company experienced rapid growth. In\n2020, its revenue was 2.847 billion yuan, up 63.2% year-on-year, with net profit\nrising 208.16% to 59.258 million yuan. In 2021, revenue and net profit increased\nby 57.31% and 160.6%, respectively.\n\nThe remarkable performance of Miaoke Landuo and its cheese segment attracted\nMengniu's attention, leading to multiple rounds of acquisition starting in early\n2020.\n\nMengniu's acquisition of Miaoke Landuo was conducted in several phases: In\nJanuary 2020, Mengniu first invested 287 million yuan to acquire 5% of Miaoke\nLanduo at 14 yuan per share. Subsequently, Mengniu increased its stake through\nvarious means, including private placements and centralized bidding, at\nprogressively higher prices. For instance, in December 2020, Mengniu invested 3\nbillion yuan to purchase Miaoke Landuo shares at 29.71 yuan per share; by\nOctober 2022, the purchase price had risen to 30.92 yuan per share.\n\nAs Mengniu continued its acquisitions, Miaoke Landuo's stock price soared,\nreaching 84.5 yuan per share in May 2021, with a market value exceeding 40\nbillion yuan. However, the current market value of Miaoke Landuo has since\nshrunk to around 6.8 billion yuan, with its stock price significantly lower than\nduring Mengniu's various acquisitions. This has led to external skepticism and\nchallenges regarding the large investments Mengniu made in Miaoke Landuo.\n\nSong Liang, head of the expert group of the China Dairy Industry Alliance,\nbelieves Mengniu's investment in Miaoke Landuo is strategically significant. At\nthe time of the acquisition, Mengniu was expanding its business landscape into\nareas like raw milk and infant formula, including acquiring Modern Dairy and\nAustralian formula brand Bellamy's. Post-acquisition, Mengniu gained a\nfirst-mover advantage in the cheese segment. Mengniu's management has repeatedly\nexpressed optimism about the cheese business segment.\n\nCheese, often called \"milk gold\" due to its high protein and calcium content,\nrepresents a high-end form of dairy products, typically made from ten pounds of\nmilk to produce one pound of cheese. Given its high gross profit margin, the\ncheese sector has attracted numerous enterprises, particularly with the rise of\nchildren's cheese stick products, creating new growth points for companies like\nYili and Mengniu and nurturing new brands like Dr. Cheese and Miaofei.\n\nHowever, rapid development has also led to price wars and increased raw material\ncosts, negatively impacting company profits.\n\nAn executive from a cheese company in East China told the Economic Observer that\nthe cheese market faces another variable: due to cost constraints, cheese is\npriced higher than other dairy products, and consumer eating habits are not yet\nfully developed. When consumer spending becomes more cautious, the cheese market\nfaces challenges. As a result, many cheese companies, after years of rapid\ngrowth, are now at a crossroads, seeking new points of leverage beyond the\ncheese stick product.\n\nSong Liang stated that with the integration of Mengniu's cheese business into\nMiaoke Landuo, resource sharing can be achieved, such as using Mengniu's raw\nmaterials instead of importing from companies like Fonterra. He believes that\ncompanies should develop cheese products more suited to Chinese consumer dietary\nhabits and seek growth by expanding into baking and food service markets.\n\nBeyond the cheese business, Mengniu is also undergoing other internal\nadjustments. In July 2023, Mengniu privatized the publicly listed infant formula\ncompany Yashili and rebranded its products under the \"Mengniu\" trademark.\n\n\"By packaging the cheese business into Miaoke Landuo, Mengniu is making more\nconcrete adjustments to its business segments, aiming to create a concentrated\nresource platform for each category,\" Song Liang concluded.",

        "content": "KEY INSIGHTS\n\n * Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, China Mengniu Dairy's\n   stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n * A total of 5 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51%\n   ownership\n * Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good\n   understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nA look at the shareholders of China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) can\ntell us which group is most powerful. With 53% stake, institutions possess the\nmaximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum\nupside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal,\ninstitutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with\nindividual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money\ninvested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of China Mengniu Dairy, beginning\nwith the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nSEHK:2319 Ownership Breakdown June 25th 2024\n\n\nWHAT DOES THE INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP TELL US ABOUT CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates\nthe local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are\nincluded in major indices.\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they\nown a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for\nthose institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like\nanyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on\na stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's\ntherefore worth looking at China Mengniu Dairy's earnings history below. Of\ncourse, the future is what really matters.\n\nSEHK:2319 Earnings and Revenue Growth June 25th 2024\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board\nwill likely have to pay attention to their preferences. China Mengniu Dairy is\nnot owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest\nshareholder is COFCO Corporation with 24% of shares outstanding. First Sentier\nInvestors (Australia) IM Ltd is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of\ncommon stock, and Fidelity International Ltd holds about 7.0% of the company\nstock.\n\nOn looking further, we found that 51% of the shares are owned by the top 5\nshareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the\ndecisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it\nalso makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is\nblowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it\nmight be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\n\nINSIDER OWNERSHIP OF CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between\njurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at\nthe very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should\nrepresent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers\nare on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is\nwell aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power\nis concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of China Mengniu Dairy Company\nLimited in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an\nindirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even\na small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and\nshareholders. In this case insiders own HK$75m worth of shares. Arguably, recent\nbuying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see\nif insiders have been buying or selling.\n\n\nGENERAL PUBLIC OWNERSHIP\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in\nChina Mengniu Dairy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can\ncertainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPANY OWNERSHIP\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 24%, of the China Mengniu Dairy stock. It's\nhard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who\nowns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have\nan interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a\ncompany. But to understand China Mengniu Dairy better, we need to consider many\nother factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for China Mengniu\nDairy that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow\nor shrink.

        "content": "According to Jiangxi Business Daily, Shanghai Mengniu Yogurt Technology Co.,\nLtd. was established at the beginning of 2024 with a registered capital of 10\nmillion yuan. Its activities include internet sales, brand management, supply\nchain management services, home goods sales, food sales, and other areas. The\nsole shareholder of the company is Inner Mongolia Mengniu Dairy (Group) Co.,\nLtd.\n\nOn March 26, Mengniu made important personnel changes. According to the\ncompany's official statement, the group's president, Lu Minfan, was appointed\nvice chairman with the functional role of executive director. Gao Fei, former\nsenior vice president and head of the fresh product division, assumed the\nposition of company president and became an executive director.\n\nOn March 27, at the Mengniu 2023 performance conference, new president Gao Fei\nstated that regardless of who holds the position of president today, Mengniu's\nstrategy remains unchanged. Currently, the industry is facing some challenges,\nand Mengniu will actively respond to them.\n\nThe annual report showed that in 2023, Mengniu Dairy achieved operating income\nof 98.624 billion yuan, an increase of 6.5% over the previous year, while net\nprofit was 4.809 billion yuan per year, a decrease of 9.31% from the previous\nyear.\n\nAt a briefing on March 27, Lu Minfan stated that the decrease in net profit was\nmainly due to the devaluation of large packages of powdered milk caused by\nexcess fresh powdered milk storage, dividend taxes, intensified market\ncompetition, and increased sales expenses.\n\nIn 2020, Mengniu Dairy's operating profit was 76.035 billion yuan. In 2023,\noperating profit was closest to the target of 100 billion yuan set by Lu Minfan\nin 2017.\n\nMengniu has long held a leading position in the dairy industry. The company was\nfounded in 1999 by Niu Genshen. In just 8 years, Mengniu became the two-time\nchampion of the global liquid milk market and China's dairy industry.\n\nNiu Genshen's successor, Yang Wenzhun, continued his efforts. In 2007, Mengniu\nDairy's operating profit reached 21.318 billion yuan, surpassing Yili's 19.360\nbillion yuan, becoming the largest dairy company in China. This status was\nmaintained until 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Mengniu Dairy's operating profit reached 37.388 billion yuan, ranking\nsecond in China. In 2012, Yili's operating profit reached 41.991 billion yuan,\nwhile Mengniu Dairy's operating profit fell to 36.080 billion yuan.\n\nIn 2012, Sun Yiping, who worked at Coca-Cola, became the third president of\nMengniu Dairy. In 2014, Sun Yiping pushed Mengniu to acquire 75.3% of Yashili's\nshares for 11.3 billion Hong Kong dollars. However, during Sun Yiping's era,\nMengniu slowed its growth pace, while Yili accelerated, widening the gap between\nthem.\n\nAfter Lu Minfan took over the company, he carried out a series of radical\nreforms and large-scale mergers and acquisitions to achieve the goal of\nincreasing profits to 100 billion.\n\nMengniu Dairy acquired Modern Dairy in 2017 and Shengmu Hi-Tech in 2018. From\n2020 to 2021, it controlled Magic Lando, and in 2022, it acquired Shanghai-based\nDanone's business for low-temperature products.\n\nAfter these acquisitions, Mengniu Dairy's operating profit exceeded 60 billion\nyuan in 2017, approached 80 billion yuan in 2019, and approached 100 billion\nyuan in 2023. However, whether it is operating profit or net profit, the gap\nbetween Mengniu Dairy and Yili remains significant.\n\nIn 2022, Yili's operating profit will reach 123.171 billion yuan. For the first\nnine months of 2023, Yili's operating profit was 97.404 billion yuan, close to\nMengniu Dairy's annual operating income.\n\n\nThe gap in net profit is even greater. For the first nine months of 2023, Yili's\nnet profit was 9.380 billion yuan, almost double that of Mengniu Dairy.\n\nAnalysts believe that the key factors contributing to Mengniu's growth slowdown\nare poor sales of fresh white milk and devaluation of significant volumes of\npowdered milk. The company often participates in actions to reduce prices for\nfresh milk, leading to increased costs. In addition, previous mergers and\nacquisitions did not meet expectations.\n\nHow will Gao Fei change the situation after taking over leadership?\n\n\nGao Fei, 47, joined Mengniu in 1999 and held positions as vice president of\nsales, general sales manager, marketing general manager, and group vice\npresident.\n\nAnalysts say that China's dairy industry is currently facing problems such as\nexcess raw milk and intensified competition in the industry, entering a period\nof growth constraints. The hope that Gao Fei brings to Mengniu and the market is\nthat besides being a veteran of Mengniu and charismatic, Gao Fei's advantage\nlies in understanding the market and being good at marketing.\n\n\"He is one of those who knows Mengniu best and has created the company's most\nsuccessful products,\" colleagues say.",

        "content": "China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) stock is about to trade\nex-dividend in 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a\ncompany's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which\nshareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of\nconsequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least\ntwo business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase China Mengniu Dairy's shares\nbefore the 14th of June in order to receive the dividend, which the company will\npay on the 26th of June.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is CN\u00a50.489 a share, following on from the last\n12 months, when the company distributed a total of CN\u00a50.49 per share to\nshareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that China Mengniu Dairy\nhas a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current share price of HK$14.30. Dividends\nare an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the\nbusiness is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should\nalways check whether China Mengniu Dairy has been able to grow its dividends, or\nif the dividend might be cut.\n\nSee our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more\nthan it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut.\nFortunately China Mengniu Dairy's payout ratio is modest, at just 40% of profit.\nA useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether China Mengniu Dairy\ngenerated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 37% of\nits free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash\nflow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings\ndon't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its\nfuture dividends.\n\nSEHK:2319 Historic Dividend June 10th 2024\n\n\nHAVE EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS BEEN GROWING?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers,\nbecause it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving.\nInvestors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced,\nexpect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're\nencouraged by the steady growth at China Mengniu Dairy, with earnings per share\nup 9.4% on average over the last five years. Management have been reinvested\nmore than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company\nhas been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. We think this is\ngenerally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination\nof earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its\nhistorical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, China Mengniu Dairy\nhas lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's encouraging\nto see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at\nleast some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nShould investors buy China Mengniu Dairy for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per\nshare growth has been growing somewhat, and China Mengniu Dairy is paying out\nless than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for\na few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the\nbusiness, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might\nbe nice to see earnings growing faster, but China Mengniu Dairy is being\nconservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over\nthe long run. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of\nfurther research.\n\nOn that note, you'll want to research what risks China Mengniu Dairy is facing.\nFor example, we've found 2 warning signs for China Mengniu Dairy that we\nrecommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.\nHere's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether China Mengniu Dairy is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The organizations estimate\nthat the new technology could help upcycle billions of pounds of dairy\nco-products each year. \u201cWe are innovating to continue our trajectory as\nenvironmental stewards that take care of our world and create value for dairy\nfarm families by potentially lowering manufacturing costs and creating a\nsignificant new revenue stream for those farmers,\u201d said Greg Schlafer, president\nand CEO of Foremost Farms. (Company reports)\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s Fonterra Co-operative Group announced at its annual meeting\nseveral new initiatives supporting its climate ambitions. The first, an on-farm\nemissions reduction target, seeks to reduce the intensity of on-farm emissions\n(which comprises 86% of the co-op\u2019s total emissions) by 30% by the year 2030.\nFonterra said it plans to achieve this new target through reduction efforts,\nincluding sharing farming best practices\u202fsuch as feed quality and improving herd\nperformance; novel technologies being developed through the agribusiness and\ngovernment joint venture AgriZeroNZ; carbon removals from existing and new\nvegetation; and historical land-use change conversions to dairy. To support this\nplan, Fonterra launched a Climate Roadmap, a plan that outlines the actions the\nco-op will take toward its 2030 targets and ambition to be \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050.\nIn addition, Fonterra voluntarily released its first climate-related disclosure\nreport, which identifies risks and opportunities related to climate and helps\nthe co-op plan for the future. New Zealand claims to be the first country to\npass a law introducing mandatory climate-related risk reporting. This\nrequirement will become mandatory next year for roughly 200 New Zealand\ncompanies, including Fonterra. Separate from Fonterra, New Zealand regional\ngovernments continue to advance new sustainability regulations. Proposed land\nand water regulations for the Otago region would cause several changes for area\nfarmers. The regs include proposed changes around setbacks from waterbodies for\nvarious farming activities, suggested limits on the number of cows per hectare\nas a measure of intensity, suggested restrictions on the amount of nitrogen\nfertilizer used per hectare, and changes around minimum flows for the\nManuherekia River. Farmers have expressed significant concerns regarding the\nproposals, which are still in the draft stage. The deadline to finalize the plan\nis June 2024.

        "content": "The premium infant formula maker is taking a hit from China\u2019s low birth rate,\nbut investors may like its dividends and transition to other dairy products\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n\n * China Feihe posted declines in both profits and sales last year, as it is\n   heavily exposed to the country\u2019s falling birth rate\n * The company, which gets 91% of its revenue from infant milk formula, may\n   remain attractive to investors due to its pledge to pay much of its profits\n   as dividends\n\nBy Edith Terry\n\nChina Feihe Ltd.\u2019s (6186.HK) 2023 year-end results, announced last week, were\ndismal enough to leave investors crying over plenty of spilled milk. The infant\nformula maker\u2019s annual revenue sank 8.3% year-on-year to 19.5 billion yuan\n($2.69 billion), and its profit fell by an even larger 33.5% to 3.3 billion\nyuan. But rather than cry, investors applauded the results with a rise of over\n9% in the company\u2019s stock. So, what do they see in this homegrown infant powder\nstar?\n\nOne answer is the healthy dividends it is spinning off. It paid an interim\ndividend amounting to 1.1 billion yuan last September, equal to 30% of profits.\nAnd in its latest results announcement, it promised to return another 40% of its\nprofit in a dividend whose amount will be determined and approved at its annual\nmeeting.\n\nSuch dividend payments are a popular strategy for attracting investors by\nconsumer stocks like Feihe, which tend to soak up plenty of revenue but whose\nslower growth stories tend to be less attractive than sexier companies from\nsectors like tech and new energy.\n\nDividends aside, Feihe\u2019s latest results offer clues that the company may be\nworking hard to diversify beyond its core infant formula into powdered milk for\nchildren and adults, as well as new milk products with better growth potential.\nAnd it has 10.5 billion yuan in cash to cushion it through any transition. While\nits sales of infant milk formula products fell 10.3% to 17.8 billion last year,\nsales of its \u201cother dairy products\u201d actually rose by 23.4%.\n\nInfant milk formula makes up 91.5% of Feihe\u2019s revenue, with \u201cother\u201d dairy\nproducts, such as adult milk powder, liquid milk and rice powder supplements,\naccounting for a far smaller but faster-growing 7.3%. The shift to those other\ngroups looks like a positive trend in the face of demographic inevitability with\nChina\u2019s plunging birth rate.\n\nA total of 9.02 million babies were born in the country last year, the lowest\nnumber since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949 and the second year\nof sharp declines. In addition to falling birth rates, companies like Feihe are\nalso facing the challenge of recently overhauled government regulations on\ninfant milk powder quality that some are calling the toughest in the world.\n\nThe objective is to set standards as close as possible to breast milk. The\ntoughness is also partly in response to a 2008 scandal where six infants died\nand another 300,000 fell ill after drinking infant formula spiked with melamine,\na toxic chemical that some producers used to boost their scores in milk protein\ntests.\n\nMany of the 400 brands in the market before the new regulations have now left,\nand remaining players have had to re-certify their products. The market\nturbulence forced at least one major international player, Nestl\u00e9 (NESN.SW), to\nclose a baby milk factory in Ireland last October that produced milk solely for\nthe Chinese market.\n\nFALLING MARGINS\n\nOther metrics for China Feihe\u2019s 2023 fiscal year were equally dismal as its top-\nand bottom-line numbers. Its gross profit margin fell to 64.8% from 65.5% in\n2022. And 2022\u2019s results were nothing to get excited about either, with revenue\nand profit down 6.4% and 28.4% from 2021 levels, respectively.\n\nThe company\u2019s 2021 annual report, whose cover featured a gold star and a can of\nmilk powder, included the last time revenue increased, rising 22.5% to 22.7\nbillion yuan. But even in the peak year of 2021, profit was down by 7%.\n\nThe year 2021 was also when China officially adopted its \u201cthree-child\u201d policy,\nraising the permissible number of children to three from the previous two. In\n2016 the government abandoned its decades-old \u201cone child\u201d policy that imposed\nfines and other restrictions on couples who went beyond the limit. Feihe\u2019s\nshares were hitting record highs around that time, rising to more than three\ntimes their IPO price of HK$7.50 from 2019, as investors bet it could become a\nbig beneficiary of the government\u2019s call for people to have more children.\n\nBut the policy changes have failed to have the desired effects of improving\nbirth rates, with many people citing the high cost of raising children as a\nmajor deterrent. Feihe\u2019s shares sagged as its revenue began contracting with the\nfalling birth rates, and its current share price is now about half its IPO\nprice.\n\nFeihe\u2019s stock certainly isn\u2019t alone in feeling the shrinking pains of China\u2019s\ndeclining fertility rates. Shares of leading dairy Yili Industrial (600887.SS)\nalso peaked in 2021 before falling. But unlike Feihe, Yili\u2019s top and bottom\nlines have both been rising since 2020. The same is true for Mengniu Dairy\n(2319.HK), whose shares also peaked in 2021, but whose revenue and profit\ncontinue to rise. Mengniu subsidiary China Modern Dairy (1117.HK) has similar\nstock trends, but has recorded falling profits despite growing revenue.\n\nThose differences might imply that the regulatory change has favored older\nplayers like Mengniu and Yili with closer state ties, at the expense of newer\ncompanies like Feihei and Modern Dairy. Feihe\u2019s heavy reliance on infant formula\nis also working against it, while its peers have more diverse product lines. Its\nrecent diversification moves are aimed at weaning it from overreliance on the\ninfant market, but the transition is taking time.\n\nAll those differences show up in Feihe\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is\nmarkedly lower than the other three companies. Its stock currently trades at a\nratio of 7.4, compared with 13 and 17 for Mengniu and Yili, respectively. China\nModern Dairy trades at the highest ratio of 33.\n\nThe strong market reaction to Feihe\u2019s latest earnings could partly reflect the\nstock\u2019s current low valuation as well as enthusiasm about the company\u2019s dividend\npolicy. Investors may also like Feihe for its position in the relatively\nrecession-proof consumer space, which should help to stabilize its revenue even\nas people cut back on spending in more discretionary areas in the current\nclimate of economic uncertainty.\n\nTo subscribe to Bamboo Works free weekly newsletter, click\u00a0here\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "With its stock down 18% over the past month, it is easy to disregard China\nMengniu Dairy (HKG:2319). But if you pay close attention, you might find that\nits key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock\ncould potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more\nresilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study China\nMengniu Dairy's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a\ncompany's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used\nto assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for China Mengniu Dairy\n\n\nHOW IS ROE CALCULATED?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders'\nEquity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for China Mengniu Dairy is:\n\n9.6% = CN\u00a54.9b \u00f7 CN\u00a551b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every HK$1 of its\nshareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of HK$0.10.\n\n\nWHAT HAS ROE GOT TO DO WITH EARNINGS GROWTH?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is\ngenerating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company\nreinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the\ngrowth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal,\nfirms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth\nrate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\n\nCHINA MENGNIU DAIRY'S EARNINGS GROWTH AND 9.6% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, China Mengniu Dairy's ROE is not much to talk about. However,\nits ROE is similar to the industry average of 8.7%, so we won't completely\ndismiss the company. Having said that, China Mengniu Dairy has shown a modest\nnet income growth of 9.8% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE,\nit is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this\ngrowth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed\nefficiently.\n\nAs a next step, we compared China Mengniu Dairy's net income growth with the\nindustry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher\nthan the average industry growth of 0.7%.\n\nSEHK:2319 Past Earnings Growth April 15th 2024\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its\nearnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has\npriced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they\nwill have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy\nwaters await. If you're wondering about China Mengniu Dairy's's valuation, check\nout this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\n\nIS CHINA MENGNIU DAIRY MAKING EFFICIENT USE OF ITS PROFITS?\n\nChina Mengniu Dairy has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median\npayout ratio of 29% (or a retention ratio of 71%) and a respectable amount of\ngrowth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making\nefficient use of its profits.\n\nBesides, China Mengniu Dairy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or\nmore. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its\nshareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the\ncompany is expected to rise to 43% over the next three years. Still, forecasts\nsuggest that China Mengniu Dairy's future ROE will rise to 12% even though the\nthe company's payout ratio is expected to rise.

Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company\nreinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt\ncontributed to its high earnings growth.

For the full year of 2022, the company\nachieved revenue of 46,736 billion yuan (YoY +52.32%), gross profit of 9.892\nbillion yuan (YoY +37.44%), non-IFRS net profit of 2,616 million yuan (YoY\n+86.61%), and 154 million annual active users (YoY +25.14%).\n\nCore views:\n\n1. Revenue growth, increased profits, and abundant cash flow showed strong\ngrowth performance, and subsequent development was full of confidence. Revenue\nin 2022 was 46.7 billion yuan, an increase of 52.3% over the previous year; the\nannual non-IFRS net profit was 26.02 billion yuan, an increase of 86.6% over the\nprevious year. Company owners should account for the annual profit of 380\nmillion yuan, turning a loss into a profit; cash flow from operating activities\nreached 5.91 billion yuan, an increase of 72.1% over the previous year. By\nbusiness, product revenue in 2022 was 404 billion yuan (YOY +54.2%), mainly due\nto the increase in the number of active users and additional purchases by users,\nthe continuous increase in the online penetration rate of pharmaceutical and\nhealth product sales, and the diversification of product categories; service\nrevenue of 6.4 billion yuan (+41.4%), mainly due to the increase in the number\nof advertisers on the platform, the increase in digital marketing service fees\nand the increase in sales of third-party merchants on online platforms, which\nled to increased commissions and platform usage fees.\n\nBy category, drug revenue continues to grow rapidly. Pharmaceuticals, especially\nprescription drugs, have lower gross margins at this stage than\nnon-pharmaceuticals, and the gross margin of medical devices and health products\nis steadily rising slightly. With a high base growth base in 2022, the company\nis full of confidence in revenue and profit growth in 2023. The driving force\ncomes from the fact that there is still plenty of room for user penetration, and\nthe pandemic has increased users' attention to health and online channel trust;\ntechnological progress, user choice, and economic form recovery will boost\nindustry confidence and enrich the supply side at low cost; the company's\nbusiness development level is leading in the industry, rich in products and\nservices, and strong capabilities. In 2023, the main work will focus on\nmaintaining rapid growth, innovative breakthroughs, and opening up the\necosystem. We are confident that it will reach 60 billion dollars in sales\nrevenue and a revenue growth rate of more than 30%. It is expected that gross\nprofit will stop falling or even rise slightly.\n\n2. The number of users has grown brilliantly, and the mentality and habits of\nonline consumption of pharmaceutical products and healthcare services have\ngradually developed. The pandemic has become a good market education\nopportunity. Users' trust in the platform has increased and will be maintained\nand widely spread over the long term. The company has further strengthened the\nuser platform's mentality of medical treatment and drug purchase through rich\ncategories and optimized service processes and product experience. In 2022, the\nnumber of annual active users reached 154 million, an increase of 31 million\ncompared to 2021. The penetration rate of the number of annual active users, the\nfrequency of consumption, and total consumption continued to increase\nyear-on-month and month-on-month. There is still plenty of room for exploration\nin user management in the three categories of pharmaceuticals, devices, and\nhealth products.\n\n3. Category expansion, supply chain optimization, service improvement,\ncomprehensive strengthening of comprehensive strength. The company continues to\nexpand the range of medical and health products, cooperate deeply with\nsuppliers, continuously strengthen the medical and health product supply chain\nnetwork covering all scenarios, and make full use of digital infrastructure to\nfurther improve supply chain management efficiency. In 2022, the number of\npharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical warehouses nationwide increased to 22 and\nmore than 500, respectively, and the pharmaceutical self-operated cold chain\ncapacity has also covered more than 300 cities across the country. In terms of\nmedical and health services, the company has established a new healthcare\nservice ecosystem composed of serious medical treatment, family health\nmanagement and consumer medical care, and has continuously improved online and\noffline integrated service capabilities. Furthermore, the medical service\ncapacity of the Jingdong Health Internet Hospital will be further enhanced, and\nthe department settings will be improved. By the end of 2022, 27 specialist\ncenters with top experts as subject leaders had been set up, more than 150\nlevel-II clinical departments had been established, and the average number of\nonline consultations was over 300,000 per day throughout the year.\n\nProfit forecasts and investment suggestions: We continue to be optimistic about\nthe long-term health and sustainability of the company's overall business. The\nrapid increase in ARPU value due to increased service revenue, number of users,\nand user stickiness drove steady growth in the company's performance. Since 2022\nresults exceeded our expectations, we adjusted JD Health's revenue from 2023 to\n2024 to 626.0/83.5 billion yuan respectively (the previous forecast was\n588.84/780.1 billion yuan for 2023-2024). Since the revenue side exceeded\nexpectations, our net profit adjusted to non-international accounting standards\nwas 35.95/5.317 billion yuan respectively (the previous forecast was 2023-2024\nfor 2023-2024 3372/4,959 billion yuan). Since JD Health is the industry leader\nand has a huge user base and user stickiness, the company will enjoy a certain\nvaluation premium. We will give the target company 2022 PS 3.5X, corresponding\nto the target market value of 219.1 billion yuan in 2022. Maintain a \u201cbuy\u201d\nrating.\n\nRisk warning: Decline in macroeconomic growth, intensification of market\ncompetition, industry growth falling short of expectations, policy risks,\nincrease in monetization rate and gross profit margin falling short of\nexpectations, insufficient business collaboration, falling short of\nexpectations, etc.",

        "content": "China's internet medical service sector, after nearly a decade of highs and\nlows, is facing critical challenges that will shape its future. Initially driven\nby technological advances and increased healthcare demand, the industry exploded\ninto a nearly 380-billion-yuan ($52.2 billion) market serving over 360 million\npeople through various services like web-based health consulting, disease\nmanagement, and pharmacy offerings [para. 1][para. 2]. Despite this growth, most\ncompanies struggle to find sustainable business models, particularly amid\nChina's slowing economy and sluggish capital markets, leading to job cuts and\nmarket exits for smaller competitors [para. 3][para. 4].\n\nHaoDF, Chunyu Yisheng, and Ping An Good Doctor are among those affected, with\nmany investors wary of further investing in this sector. The debut of Fangzhou\nInc. on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which saw a 45% drop on its first trading\nday, underscores this caution [para. 5][para. 6]. Initially considered\ntransformative, internet healthcare remains peripheral with primary medical\nresources controlled by public hospitals, limiting its reach [para. 7].\nEntrepreneurs face the challenge of adapting to regulatory and economic changes\nwhile leveraging new technologies and consumer trends [para. 8].\n\nHaoDF, a pioneering platform founded in 2006, expanded its services with the\nrise of mobile internet but struggled post-2014 due to capital market downturns.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic temporarily boosted online medical services, with the\nnumber of online consultations at 44 public hospitals multiplying 17-fold in\n2020 [para. 12][para. 13]. Despite this, sustainable gains eluded providers as\ndemand declined post-pandemic [para. 14][para. 15]. By the end of 2022, many\nplatforms grappled with funding shortages and unsustainable business modes,\nleading to significant workforce reductions [para. 20][para. 21].\n\nProfit generation remains a critical issue. HaoDF's Wang Hang insists on\nprofitability through platform service fees and corporate membership services,\nthough market responses have been tepid. Most platforms focus on low-value\nservices like basic health consultations and prescription refills, which do not\ndrive significant revenue [para. 24][para. 25]. Some have piloted membership\nsystems, but consumer interest remains low, and selling medicines remains the\nonly profitable venture. In 2022, online pharmaceutical sales reached 235.8\nbillion yuan, growing 32.6% from 2020, driven by health supplements and OTC\ntreatments [para. 32][para. 33].\n\nMajor players like JD Health and Alibaba Health dominate the online pharmacy\nmarket, leveraging extensive e-commerce networks. JD Health, the largest online\nmedication provider by the end of 2023, saw a 14.5% revenue increase to 53.5\nbillion yuan and a 463% surge in net profits to 2.1 billion yuan [para. 36]. The\nmarket, however, is increasingly competitive with new players like Meituan and\nEle.me entering, emphasizing rapid delivery services [para. 37].\n\nThe industry remains a focal point for investment but with reduced valuations\nand fewer \"unicorns\" than earlier years. Investment priorities have shifted\ntowards securing funding and survival [para. 40]. While some investors have\nretreated, others still see potential in digital healthcare, emphasizing the\nneed for patience and strategic utilization of public hospital physicians and\nmedical insurance coverage [para. 45][para. 46]. The consensus is mixed, with\nsome optimistic about future opportunities despite current struggles [para. 48].\n\n### Contributing Reporters:\n\nHan Wei, Zhou Xinda, Liu Denghui, Zhong Tengda contributed to this report.

But if you're\nwondering whether JD.com could rebound, transform its fortunes, and someday\ndeliver big gains from here to savvy investors, the place to start is with a\nmeasured look at its recent performance and the nuances of its markets.\n\n\nMARKET DOMINANCE AND COMPETITIVE EDGE\n\nJD.com holds a commanding 26% share of China's e-commerce gross merchandise\nvolume, according to Statista, positioning it as a rising competitor to industry\nleader Alibaba (NYSE: BABA). Its strategic investments in digital and logistics\ninfrastructure align with the digital economy's continued growth. Such a\nsignificant market presence, bolstered by its position as an intermediary\nbetween businesses and buyers, fortifies the company's competitive edge.\n\nJD.com's stellar market position rests against the backdrop of fierce\ncompetition in the e-commerce sector. Significant market share in a growth-prone\nsegment suggests strong potential for capital appreciation. JD.com must still\ninnovate continually to maintain its market stronghold and grow. Its strategy to\nintegrate advanced digital infrastructure into its business model both cements\nits position in the e-commerce market and provides a scalable platform for\nfuture growth. This approach may help disrupt traditional market dynamics,\noffering JD.com an edge in capturing new market segments.\n\n\nFINANCIAL STRENGTH AND STABILITY\n\nJD.com's stable revenue growth and operational income indicate it possesses a\nsturdy foundation. Its most recent quarterly earnings report demonstrated\nresilience amid market volatility, with net revenues reaching $34 billion, up\n1.7% year over year. This growth, albeit modest, confirms a steady market\npresence. Operational income rose to $1.3 billion from the prior-year period's\n$1.2 billion, showcasing effective cost management strategies. Financial\nstability is crucial in the fluctuating e-commerce market, potentially heralding\nsustainable growth.\n\nThe company's ability to effectively manage costs and optimize its operations\ncould signal its readiness to capitalize on new business opportunities, thus\nensuring sustained growth in the long term. However, such a modest revenue\nincrease also indicates that investor confidence -- and its stock price -- may\ngrow slowly instead of skyrocketing, a major point in weighing JD.com's value as\na long-term investment.\n\n\nTHE CHINESE CALCULATION\n\nThe digital economy significantly contributes to China's GDP, with the portion\nof its retail sales conducted online surpassing the global average. This robust\ne-commerce environment is a promising sign for companies like JD.com. With\nnearly 850 million digital buyers, according to Statista, China's market offers\nimmense growth opportunities for JD.com. The e-commerce company's alignment with\nChina's burgeoning digital economy positions it to tap into the expanding pool\nof digital consumers. This alignment could be key in capturing emerging market\ntrends and meeting the evolving needs of China's vast consumer base.\n\nHowever, geopolitical concerns ensured a rough year for Chinese markets in 2023,\ncontributing heavily to JD.com's share price drop over the last year. The\nChinese government continues to consider stimulus measurements amid these\neconomic woes, which could bode well for beaten-down investor confidence.\nFurther government intervention could either bolster or erode JD.com's efforts\nin the near future, and courts recently sided with JD.com in an anti-monopoly\ncase against industry-leading Alibaba. Continual development also favors\ne-commerce, as Statista projects that the Chinese e-commerce market will grow at\na compound annual rate close to 10% over the next five years, resulting in a\nprojected market volume of over $2.1 trillion.\n\n\nDIVIDENDS\n\nJD.com's dividend yield of 2.6% and its forward annual dividend payout of $0.62\nper share indicate its ability to generate steady income for investors, a factor\nparticularly appealing for those focused on income generation through their\ninvestments. Its payout ratio of 28.33% signifies JD.com's balance in allocating\nprofits; it returns a significant portion to shareholders while retaining\nsufficient funds to reinvest in the business for future growth.\n\nThis approach suggests a strategic focus on both shareholder value and the\nlong-term expansion of the company. This blend of stability in income with\npotential for growth makes JD.com a more attractive option for those seeking a\nmix of income and capital appreciation.\n\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD\n\nJD.com's low rate of revenue growth indicates a slower pace in market expansion\nrecently, especially when contrasted with Alibaba's dominance. With a profit\nmargin of 2.2% and an operating margin of 3.8%, it has a long way to go to match\nAlibaba's margins of 14.5% and 14.9%, respectively. Profit and operating margins\ndemonstrate efficacy and the ability to transform revenues into value for the\ncompany.\n\nThe dynamic and highly competitive nature of China's e-commerce sector demands\nconstant innovation and strategic agility. JD.com's future growth hinges on its\nability to navigate these market intricacies and sustain its expansion momentum.\nTo surmount these challenges, JD.com must capitalize on supply chain management\nand customer service. Efficiency improvements and cost reductions in its supply\nchain can bolster profitability. Exploring new market segments could further\ncounteract its slower revenue growth and help build market position.\n\n\nEYES ON THE PRIZE\n\nJD.com's path to creating millionaires through investment is laden with\nchallenges, yet the company's financial stability, market strength, and\nshareholder value focus present it as a highly viable candidate for long-term\ninvestment. While immediate returns might not be soaring, JD.com's gradual\ngrowth trajectory could significantly contribute to wealth accumulation over\ntime.\n\nThe best way to shoot for millions remains to adopt a diversified portfolio\napproach and hold for long-term growth as your investments accumulate wealth\ngradually. JD.com could very well represent a strong choice for such a portfolio\nin the years to come, though one that comes with the caveat of navigating tricky\ninternational waters.\n\nNicholas Robbins has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "content": "These undervalued e-commerce stocks have steady revenue growth with EBITDA\nmargin expansion on operating leverage\n\nJul 8, 2024, 4:15 pm EDT July 8, 2024\n\nE-commerce stocks were among the hottest names to buy during the pandemic. As\nonline shopping surged, some of the best e-commerce stocks traded at rich\nvaluations. However, the tables turned in a post-pandemic world and with\ndownward growth adjustments, e-commerce stocks plunged. As always, markets tend\nto react to the extremes and e-commerce stocks now seem undervalued. This column\nfocuses on three undervalued e-commerce stocks to buy and hold until 2030.\n\nAn important point is that the global e-commerce industry is expected to grow\nsteadily. The global e-commerce market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16.9%\nbetween 2023 and 2030, and by the end of the decade, it will be worth $21.2\ntrillion.\n\nTherefore, some of the top e-commerce companies have ample headroom for growth.\nI have investigated undervalued e-commerce stocks focused on emerging markets\nlike China, Southeast Asia and other emerging Asian countries. Given the\nrelatively under-penetrated market, the growth potential for the discussed ideas\nis significant.\n\n\nCOUPANG (CPNG)\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock touched 52-week lows of $13.5 in February. Since then,\nthe stock has traded 60% higher, and I expect the uptrend to be sustained. The\nkey factor is an improvement in business fundamentals.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Coupang reported healthy revenue growth of 23% on a year-on-year\nbasis to $7.1 billion. The acquisition of Farfetch supported top-line growth.\nAnother big positive is that the company\u2019s active customers in the product\ncommerce segment increased by 16% to 21.5 million.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Coupang has reported a free cash flow of $1.5 billion.\nKey business and financial metrics are therefore encouraging. With the expansion\nin emerging Asia and Southeast Asia, I expect continued upside in active users\nand cash flows.\n\nFrom the perspective of margins, Coupang expects that Farfetch will achieve\npositive adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2024. While the EBITDA margin declined in\nQ1, the long-term trend will likely be upward.\n\n\nSEA LIMITED (SE)\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter touching highs of $360 in October 2021, Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) stock was in\na meltdown mode and touched 52-week lows of $32.3 in January. However, there has\nbeen a sharp reversal rally from those levels, and SE stock trades at $72. It\nseems clear that the e-commerce stock has bottomed out. Based on growth and\nEBITDA margin expansion, I expect the uptrend to be sustained in the coming\nyears.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sea Limited\u2019s concern was not related to top-line growth.\nThe company operates in an attractive Southeast Asian market.\n\nHowever, SE stock plunged on the back of a significant cash burn on a sustained\nbasis. There finally seems to be good news, with Q1 2024 adjusted EBITDA at\n$401.1 million. With operating leverage, the e-commerce segment EBITDA will\nlikely continue to improve. With integrated logistics capabilities as a\ndifferentiating factor, the outlook is bullish for the e-commerce business.\n\nSea Limited ended Q1 2024 with a strong cash buffer of $8.6 billion. This\nprovides ample flexibility to improve the service quality in the e-commerce\nsegment and drive technological advancement in the digital financial services\nbusiness.\n\n\nJD.COM (JD)\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce stock trading at a significant\nvaluation gap. A forward P/E of 8.2 implies limited downside but significant\nupside potential. JD stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.84%.\n\nEven with regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds, JD.com has delivered revenue\ngrowth at a CAGR of 19% between 2018 and 2023. With diversification, healthy\ngrowth will likely sustain.\n\nFor Q1 2024, JD Retail reported revenue growth of 7% year over year. For the\nsame period, JD Logistics reported 15% growth. Additionally, JD has been\ninvesting in new businesses, and these early-stage companies are setting the\nstage for growth in the next five years.\n\nFor 2023, JD.com reported a free cash flow of 40.7 billion renminbi. This\nprovides high flexibility for capital investments and dividends. Therefore, the\nfundamentals are strong and the current valuation does not reflect the growth\nand value creation potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This marks a year over year increase of over $300\n   million, primarily due to working capital improvements.\u00a0\n * Full-year 2023 capital expenditures were $18.8 billion, down from $23.1\n   billion in 2022.\u00a0\n * The company ended 2023 with free cash flow1 of $18.7 billion, an increase\n   from $14.1 billion in 2022.\n * Consolidated net loss for the fourth-quarter 2023 was $2.6 billion, compared\n   to consolidated net income of $6.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2022, and\n   consolidated adjusted EBITDA1 was $11.7 billion, in line with the 2022\n   result.\u00a0\n * Verizon's total unsecured debt as of the end of the year was $128.5 billion,\n   a $2.1 billion increase sequentially, but $2.1 billion lower year over year.\n   The company's net unsecured debt1 at the end of the year was $126.4 billion,\n   a $4.2 billion increase from third-quarter 2023, but $1.6 billion lower year\n   over year. At the end of fourth-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured\n   debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 10.6 times and net unsecured debt\n   to adjusted EBITDA ratio1 was approximately 2.6 times.\n\n\nVERIZON CONSUMER RESULTS\n\n * Total Verizon Consumer revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 was $27.0 billion, an\n   increase of 0.7 percent year over year as growth in service revenue was\n   offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue and other revenue. For\n   full-year 2023, total Consumer revenue was $101.6 billion, a decrease of 1.8\n   percent from full-year 2022.\n * Wireless service revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 increased 3.2 percent year\n   over year driven primarily by growth in Consumer wireless postpaid Average\n   Revenue Per Account (ARPA) resulting from pricing actions implemented in\n   recent quarters, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco\n   recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, higher\n   premium price plan adoption, and growth from fixed wireless access offerings.\n   For full-year 2023, total Consumer wireless service revenue was $63.4\n   billion, an increase of 3.0 percent from full-year 2022.\u00a0\n * Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.08 percent in fourth-quarter\n   2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.88 percent.\u00a0\n * In fourth-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 318,000 wireless retail postpaid\n   phone net additions, representing an improvement of 369,000 from\n   third-quarter 2023 and 277,000 from fourth-quarter 2022. Consumer postpaid\n   phone gross additions in the fourth-quarter 2023 increased 16.9 percent year\n   over year, the best performance in four years.\u00a0\n * Verizon continues to see better performance in the markets where C-Band is\n   deployed. In Verizon's first 76 C-Band markets, fourth-quarter growth in\n   Consumer postpaid phone gross additions was more than 8 percentage points\n   better than in non C-Band markets and postpaid phone churn remains lower than\n   non C-Band markets.\u00a0\n * Consumer reported 289,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in\n   fourth-quarter 2023.\u00a0\n * Consumer reported 231,000 fixed wireless net additions and 53,000 Fios\n   Internet net additions in fourth-quarter 2023. Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9\n   billion in fourth-quarter 2023, an increase of 1.0 percent year over year.\n   Full-year 2023 Consumer Fios revenue was $11.6 billion, relatively flat year\n   over year.\n * In fourth-quarter 2023, Consumer operating income was $7.0 billion, an\n   increase of 0.1 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin\n   was 26.1 percent, a decrease from 26.3 percent in fourth-quarter 2022.\n   Full-year 2023 Consumer operating income was $29.0 billion, an increase of\n   0.6 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 28.5\n   percent, an increase from 27.9 percent in full-year 2022. Segment EBITDA1 in\n   fourth-quarter 2023 was $10.4 billion, an increase of 2.4 percent year over\n   year. This improvement can be attributed to wireless service revenue growth\n   and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin1 in fourth-quarter 2023 was\n   38.5 percent, an increase from 37.9 percent in fourth-quarter 2022. Full-year\n   2023 segment EBITDA margin1 was 41.4 percent, an increase from 40.2 percent\n   in 2022.\n\n\nVERIZON BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n * Total Verizon Business revenue was $7.6 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, a\n   decrease of 3.6 percent year over year as lower wireline revenue and lower\n   wireless equipment revenue was partially offset by higher wireless service\n   revenue. For full-year 2023, total Business revenue was $30.1 billion, a 3.1\n   percent decrease year over year.\u00a0\n * Business wireless service revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 was $3.4 billion, an\n   increase of 3.0 percent year over year. This was driven by the larger\n   allocation of our administration and telco recovery fees from other revenue\n   into wireless service revenue, continued strong net additions and the benefit\n   of pricing actions implemented earlier in the year. Full-year 2023 Business\n   wireless service revenue was $13.4 billion, an increase of 4.1 percent\n   compared to full-year 2022.\u00a0\n * Business reported 292,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in\n   fourth-quarter 2023, including 131,000 postpaid phone net additions.

Business continues to grow volumes and expand\n   its relationships with customers strengthening its position as a wireless\n   market share leader.\n * Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48 percent in fourth-quarter\n   2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.12 percent.\n * Business reported 144,000 fixed wireless net additions in fourth-quarter\n   2023.\u00a0\n * In fourth-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $443 million, a\n   decrease of 24.3 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin\n   was 5.8 percent, a decrease from 7.4 percent in fourth-quarter 2022.\n   Full-year 2023 segment operating income was $2.1 billion, a decrease of 21.5\n   percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 6.9 percent,\n   compared with 8.5 percent in full-year 2022. Segment EBITDA1 in\n   fourth-quarter 2023 was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 4.5 percent year over\n   year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues. Segment\n   EBITDA margin1 in fourth-quarter 2023 was 21.1 percent, a decrease from 21.3\n   percent in fourth-quarter 2022. For the full year, segment EBITDA margin1 was\n   21.8 percent, a decrease from 22.3 percent in 2022.\n   \n\n\nOUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE\n\nThe company does not provide a reconciliation for any of the following adjusted\n(non-GAAP) forecasts because it cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the\nspecial items that could arise, and the company is unable to address the\nprobable significance of the unavailable information.\u00a0\n\nFor 2024, Verizon expects the following:\u00a0\n\n * Total wireless service revenue growth2 of 2.0 percent to 3.5 percent.\n * Adjusted EBITDA growth1 of 1.0 percent to 3.0 percent.\n * Adjusted EPS1 of $4.50 to $4.70.\n * Capital expenditures between $17.0 billion and $17.5 billion.\u00a0\n * Adjusted effective income tax rate1 in the range of 22.5 percent to 24.0\n   percent.\n\n1 Non-GAAP financial measure.

        "content": "KEY INSIGHTS\n\n * The considerable ownership by public companies in JD Health International\n   indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and\n   business strategy\n * JD.com, Inc. owns 67% of the company\n * Insiders have been selling lately\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of JD Health International Inc.\n(HKG:6618), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the\nbusiness. With 67% stake, public companies possess the maximum shares in the\ncompany. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or\nlose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nAs market cap fell to HK$67b last week, public companies would have faced the\nhighest losses than any other shareholder groups of the company.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of JD Health\nInternational.\n\nView our latest analysis for JD Health International\n\nSEHK:6618 Ownership Breakdown July 3rd 2024\n\n\nWHAT DOES THE INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP TELL US ABOUT JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to\ntheir own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once\nit's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some\ninstitutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nJD Health International already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed,\nthey own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company\nhas a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is\nbest to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with\ninstitutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to\nsee a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out\nof a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings\ntrajectory of JD Health International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that\nthere are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSEHK:6618 Earnings and Revenue Growth July 3rd 2024\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in JD Health International. JD.com, Inc. is\ncurrently the company's largest shareholder with 67% of shares outstanding. With\nsuch a huge stake in the ownership, we infer that they have significant control\nof the future of the company. The second and third largest shareholders are The\nVanguard Group, Inc. and Krane Funds Advisors, LLC, with an equal amount of\nshares to their name at 1.3%.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your\nresearch, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get\na deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts\ncover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\n\nINSIDER OWNERSHIP OF JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between\njurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at\nthe very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not\nuncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a\nfounder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is\nwell aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power\nis concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that JD Health International Inc. insiders own under 1%\nof the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see\ninsiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to\nless than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own HK$193m worth of\nshares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more\ninteresting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\n\nGENERAL PUBLIC OWNERSHIP\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company,\nand hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be\nenough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a\ncollective impact on company policies.\n\n\nPUBLIC COMPANY OWNERSHIP\n\nPublic companies currently own 67% of JD Health International stock. This may be\na strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests.\nIt could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth\ninvestigating further.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly\ngain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Another way\nto think of that is that for every HK$1 worth of equity, the company was able to\nearn HK$0.04 in profit.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ROE AND EARNINGS GROWTH?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is\ngenerating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company\nreinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the\ngrowth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the\nhigher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company\ncompared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\n\nA SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL'S EARNINGS GROWTH AND 4.3%\nROE\n\nAt first glance, JD Health International's ROE doesn't look very promising. We\nthen compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to\nsee that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 10%. Despite this,\nsurprisingly, JD Health International saw an exceptional 43% net income growth\nover the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively\ninfluencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or\nan efficient management in place.\n\nAs a next step, we compared JD Health International's net income growth with the\nindustry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher\nthan the average industry growth of 31%.\n\nSEHK:6618 Past Earnings Growth June 7th 2024\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What\ninvestors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack\nof it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if\nthe stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is 6618 worth today? The\nintrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether\n6618 is currently mispriced by the market.\n\n\nIS JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL EFFICIENTLY RE-INVESTING ITS PROFITS?\n\nJD Health International doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which\nessentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the\nbusiness. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we\ndiscussed above.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that JD Health International has some positive\nattributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests\na very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to\nits high earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is\nexpected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. To know\nmore about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this\nfree report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\n\nVALUATION IS COMPLEX, BUT WE'RE HELPING MAKE IT SIMPLE.\n\nFind out whether JD Health International is potentially over or undervalued by\nchecking out our comprehensive analysis, which includes fair value estimates,\nrisks and warnings, dividends, insider transactions and financial health.\n\nView the Free Analysis\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "link": "https://fortune.com/2024/07/16/what-you-need-to-know-about-j-d-vances-vc-career/",
        "content": "J.D. Vance was a VC\u2014is a VC?\n\nI hedge here because, candidly, Vance\u2019s track record as a venture capitalist\njust doesn\u2019t strike me as all that deep\u2014there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, to be\nsure. The tech resume for Donald Trump\u2019s newly named running mate looks\nsomething like this: After a spell in corporate law, Vance went on to work at\nPeter Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital, and then moved to Steve Case\u2019s Revolution, before\nlaunching his own firm.\n\nVance\u2019s time at Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital seems to have overlapped with a pivotal\ntime in his life: In 2016, he published Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family\nand Culture in Crisis. The success of that book made Vance something of a brand\nname. And his gig at Revolution was connected to the firm\u2019s Rise of the Rest\nfund, which was focused on investing in startups in the heartland.\u00a0\n\nHis stint at Rise of the Rest was unremarkable, according to a 2021 Business\nInsider article, which says he was not especially versed in the intricacies of\ndeal terms or diligence, and quotes one investor saying, \u201cI don\u2019t recall anyone\nat Rise of the Rest bragging about something J.D. Vance brought to the fund.\u201d\u00a0\n\nStill, after a couple of years, Vance launched his own fund, Narya Capital, and\nraised $93 million from big names like Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Eric Schmidt.\n(Narya, if you\u2019re wondering, is another one of those J.R.R. Tolkien references.)\n\nNarya\u2019s been doing deals, as recently as this year. Per Crunchbase, Vance\u2019s firm\ninvested in real estate assessment software company ValueBase in June, and the\nfirm has done 19 deals to date. Other Narya portfolio companies include\naerospace startup True Anomaly, insurtech Branch, and farmland-focused real\nestate investing company AcreTrader.\u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t read Vance\u2019s Hillbilly book (a terrible inconvenience for me today, I\nmust say) but as I was writing this I felt it was time to start. So, huddled in\nmy hotel room at Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm Tech Conference, I bought the book on\nKindle and started. (I probably wasn\u2019t the only one doing that today.)\n\nEven from the first few pages, I can already see how this book became a\nbestseller\u2014and how it was this book that made Vance\u2019s ascension from hanger-on\nVC to presidential running mate possible. The very first lines of Hillbilly\nElegy read:\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy name is J.D. Vance, and I think I should start with a confession: I find the\nexistence of the book you hold in your hands somewhat absurd. It says right\nthere on the cover that it\u2019s a memoir, but I\u2019m thirty-one years old, and I\u2019ll be\nthe first to admit that I\u2019ve accomplished nothing great in my life, certainly\nnothing that would justify a complete stranger paying money to read about it.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to be clear that he\u2019s \u201cnot a senator, a governor, or a former cabinet\nsecretary.\u201d Well, he\u2019s now a senator, thanks in part to Thiel\u2019s support. And,\ndepending on what happens in November, he could be the second in line for the\npresidency of the United States.\u00a0\n\nSo, the venture business may have a man in the White House, a potential turn of\nevents that will likely be celebrated in the industry (including, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, by Elon Musk) regardless of Vance\u2019s investing track record. And\nVance, whatever happens in the elections, will have a nice postscript for\nHillbilly Elegy.\n\nGee Wiz\u2026Yesterday, I interviewed Wiz CEO and cofounder Assaf Rappaport and\nThrive Capital\u2019s Philip Clark at Fortune Brainstorm Tech, about a day after the\nWall Street Journal reported that Alphabet is looking at acquiring Wiz for $23\nbillion. And believe me, I attempted to get Rappaport to talk about it. If the\nold saying is\u00a0\u201cthe door is closed, try a window,\u201d I tried many windows. But\nRappaport and Clark did talk through how they\u2019re thinking about\u2026an exit.

That single transaction was for HK$507m worth of shares at a price of\nHK$57.60 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative\nif the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale\nwas at well above current price of HK$32.10. So it may not tell us anything\nabout how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nInsiders in JD Health International didn't buy any shares in the last year. You\ncan see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last\nyear depicted in the chart below.

A high insider ownership\noften makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders\nown 0.3% of JD Health International shares, worth about HK$294m. This level of\ninsider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It\ncertainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES THIS DATA SUGGEST ABOUT JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL INSIDERS?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that\ndoesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but\nlooking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the JD Health\nInternational insiders selling.

        "content": "Investors may have expected e-commerce to slow down after the global pandemic.\n\nHowever, this has not been the case.\n\nAccording to EMarketer, global e-commerce sales grew from US$4.98 trillion to\nUS$5.82 trillion from 2021 to 2023, showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis trend is underscored by Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ: AMZN) first-quarter beat in\nfiscal year 2024 (FY2024), where net sales increased 13% year on year to\nUS$143.3 billion, clearly indicating that e-commerce is here to stay.\n\nNet profit leapt to US$10.4 billion, 225% higher than the prior year.\n\nIn line with its strong financial performance, Amazon\u2019s share price has\nincreased by 25% year to date.\n\nHowever, it is not the only e-commerce player riding this trend.\u00a0\n\nWe will look at three other e-commerce stocks that have displayed significant\ngrowth this year.\n\nJD.com (JD) is a major e-commerce company based in China.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has jumped over 22% this year, comparable to Amazon\u2019s share\nprice gain.\n\nInitially just an e-commerce platform, the company has transformed into a\nleading technology and service provider with a focus on supply chain management.\n\nIts business can be categorised into five main segments, with its retail\ndivision, JD Retail, at the forefront. Beyond retail, JD also engages in the\nlogistics, technology, health, industrial, and property sectors.\u00a0\n\nIn online retail, JD sources products directly from suppliers and sells them to\nconsumers.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, in the online marketplace, JD connects customers with merchandisers,\nearning a commission on sales.\n\nFor fiscal year 2023 (FY2023), the company saw its net revenue inch up by 3.7%\nyear on year, from RMB 1.05 trillion to RMB 1.09 trillion.\u00a0\n\nNet profit more than doubled to RMB 24.2 million from RMB 10.4 billion in 2022.\n\nThe e-commerce giant generated a positive free cash flow of RMB 40.7 billion, an\nincrease from RMB 35.6 billion from the previous year.\n\nLooking at its revenue composition, its online retail business generated 88.1%\nof total revenue. The company\u2019s operating margin also improved year on year,\nfrom 1.9% to 2.4%.\u00a0\n\nThe graph below shows JD.com\u2019s operating margin over the last five years.\n\n\nJD\u2019s Operating Margin (Author\u2019s Calculation)\n\nSource: JD\u2019s Annual Report\n\nThis growth in operating margin can be attributed to the extensive logistics\nsystem the company has developed over recent years.\n\nWith over 1,600 warehouses, JD uses advanced technology and logistics expertise\nto enhance supply chain efficiency.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, in 2022, JD also partnered with the Chinese ride-hailing app DADA\n(NASDAQ: DADA) to boost its on-demand delivery volume.\u00a0\n\nThe company\u2019s expansion into high-growth markets, particularly healthcare and\ntechnology, ensures sustained demand for its services despite the dour economic\nclimate in China.\n\nLastly, JD trades at a relatively low Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.6x.\u00a0\n\nThis is a significant difference compared to the P/E multiple of its US peers,\nsuch as market leader Amazon\u2019s P/E of 64.5x and Etsy\u2019s (NASDAQ: ETSY) P/E of\n22x.\n\nThis makes JD an attractive stock for value investors.\n\n\nCOUPANG (NYSE: CPNG)\n\nCoupang, often referred to as the \u2018Amazon of South Korea\u2019, is Korea\u2019s most\nvisited e-commerce website.\n\nCoupang offers a wide array of services, ranging from its flagship \u201cRocket\nDelivery\u201d to its online services that facilitate activities such as payments,\nfood delivery, and entertainment.\n\nUnder its \u201cRocket Delivery\u201d service, Coupang promises same-day delivery, with\n99% of orders delivered within a day nationwide, powered by its technology\ninfrastructure and logistic operations.\n\nIts stock value has rocketed up more than 40% this year.\n\nAccording to its first quarterly report for 2024, active customers have grown\n16% year on year, reaching 21.5 million. This growth in users has translated\ninto a robust performance.\n\nNet sales soared 23% year on year, from US$5.8 billion to US$7.1 billion.\n\nHowever, net income fell sharply from US$86 million to US$5 million, primarily\ndue to the inclusion of the losses incurred from Coupang\u2019s latest acquisition of\nthe luxury e-commerce platform Farfetch.\n\nExcluding the impact from Farfetch, net income stood at US$98 million.\n\nCoupang\u2019s acquisition of FarFetch highlights Coupang\u2019s strategic intent to\nexpand internationally.\n\nThis acquisition positions the company as a leader in the US$400 billion global\npersonal luxury goods segment.\u00a0\n\nFree cash flow for the quarter came in at US$1.5 billion, a US$1 billion\nincrease year on year.\u00a0\n\nLike Amazon\u2019s Amazon Prime loyalty programme, Coupang also has its own\nmembership service, Coupang WOW.\n\nCoupang WOW offers several perks, such as free shipping, 30-day free returns,\nand access to an online streaming platform.\n\nThese benefits have contributed to a considerable rise in membership numbers.\u00a0\n\nWOW membership programme had 14 million paid members at the end of 2023, an\nincrease of 27% from 2022.\u00a0\n\nThis loyalty scheme ensures recurring business for the company.\u00a0\n\nLastly, the development of Coupang Pay, Coupang\u2019s fintech ecosystem, further\nenhances customer experience by streamlining transactions and securing user base\nretention.\n\n\nEBAY (NASDAQ: EBAY)\n\neBay is recognised as one of the world\u2019s largest e-commerce platforms, with a\ngross merchandise value of more than US$73 billion in 2023.\n\neBay\u2019s share price has grown considerably this year, rising by 18.8% year to\ndate.\n\nUnlike JD or Coupang, eBay conducts its business in several countries worldwide.\nThe platform operates globally, reaching over 190+ markets and serving 132\nmillion buyers last year.\u00a0\n\nDiffering from Amazon, which acts primarily as a direct seller, eBay functions\nas an auction house while also facilitating consumer to consumer (C2C)\ntransactions.\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, with its auction system, eBay distinguishes itself from other\nmarketplaces by carving its own niche.\n\nThis C2C model allows eBay to operate without the high costs associated with\nmaintaining physical inventories and warehouses, contributing to its competitive\noperating margins.\n\n\n\u00a0Operating Margin of E-commerce Companies 2024 (Author\u2019s Calculation)\n\nFollowing the first quarter of 2024, eBay\u2019s revenue witnessed a slight year on\nyear uptick of 2%, moving from US$2.51 billion to US$2.56 billion.\u00a0\n\nHowever, net income declined over 20% year on year, dropping from US$569 million\nto US$439 million.\n\nStill, the company generated a healthy free cash flow of US$472 million.\n\nFurther bolstering its appeal to investors, eBay declared a cash dividend of\nUS$0.27 per share, which will be payable on June 14 this year. This is a slight\nincrease from US$0.25 paid out the previous year.\n\nThis marks the fifth consecutive year that eBay has raised its dividend payout,\ncementing its reputation as a reliable dividend stock.\u00a0\n\nDive into the future of technology with our newest FREE report, \u201cThe Rise of\nTitans.\u201d Discover how the big 7 US tech stocks can be your ticket to huge\nlong-term gains.

(HKG:6618) shareholders won't be pleased to see\nthat the share price has had a very rough month, dropping 30% and undoing the\nprior period's positive performance. The recent drop completes a disastrous\ntwelve months for shareholders, who are sitting on a 60% loss during that time.\n\nAlthough its price has dipped substantially, given close to half the companies\nin Hong Kong have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 9x, you may still\nconsider JD Health International as a stock to avoid entirely with its 31.8x P/E\nratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a\nrational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, JD Health\nInternational has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because\ninvestors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really\nhope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nView our latest analysis for JD Health International\n\nSEHK:6618 Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry April 17th 2024\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think JD Health International's future stacks up\nagainst the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.\n\n\nHOW IS JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL'S GROWTH TRENDING?\n\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, JD Health International would need to produce\noutstanding growth well in excess of the market.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific\nincrease of 460%. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong\nwith three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. So it appears\nto us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing earnings over\nthat time.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest\nearnings should grow by 22% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping\nup to be materially higher than the 15% per annum growth forecast for the\nbroader market.\n\nWith this information, we can see why JD Health International is trading at such\na high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to\noffload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\n\n\nWHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM JD HEALTH INTERNATIONAL'S P/E?\n\nEven after such a strong price drop, JD Health International's P/E still exceeds\nthe rest of the market significantly. While the price-to-earnings ratio\nshouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a\ncapable barometer of earnings expectations.\n\nWe've established that JD Health International maintains its high P/E on the\nstrength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected.\nRight now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident\nfuture earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling\nstrongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nThe company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis.

        "content": "To say Chinese stocks have struggled lately is an understatement: The\nMorningstar China Index has lost nearly 17% annually during the past three\nyears, while the Morningstar US Market Index has gained almost 8% annually\nduring the same time period, as of April 10.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nMorningstar Indexes strategist Dan Lefkovitz explains:\n\n\u201cIn the years following the 2007-09 financial crisis, China became the largest\nemerging market. By the end of 2020, Chinese internet companies Alibaba BABA and\nTencent TCEHY were among the 10 largest public companies globally. Then came a\ngovernment crackdown, which saw leading companies\u2019 market values slashed. At the\nmacroeconomic level, China was widely anticipated to bounce back strongly in\n2023 from \u201cZero Covid\u201d lockdowns, but a property-market downturn and other woes\nundermined recovery.\u201d\n\nLong-term investors willing to accept the regulatory and geopolitical risks that\ncome with investing in China will find many undervalued Chinese stocks of\nwell-managed, competitively sound companies to choose from.\n\nTo come up with our list of the best Chinese stocks to buy now, we screened for:\n\n * Chinese companies whose stocks trade on a US exchange.\n * Chinese companies that earn wide Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings. We think\n   companies with wide economic moats should remain competitive for 20 years or\n   more.\n * Chinese stocks that are undervalued, as measured by our price/fair value\n   metric.\n\nThe stocks of these Chinese companies with wide economic moats are the most\nundervalued according to our metrics as of April 10, 2024.\n\n 1. Tencent TCEHY\n 2. Yum China YUMC\n 3. Baidu BIDU\n 4. JD.com JD\n 5. Alibaba BABA\n\nHere\u2019s a little more about each of the best Chinese stocks to buy, including\ncommentary from the Morningstar analyst who covers the company. All data is as\nof April 10, 2024.\n\n\nTENCENT\n\n * Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.44\n * Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: High\n * Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n * Industry: Internet Content & Information\n\nTencent is the cheapest stock on our list of the best Chinese stocks to buy. The\nstock of this company from the content and information industry is trading 56%\nbelow our fair value estimate of $90. Management earns an exemplary capital\nallocation rating.\n\n> Over the past decade, Tencent has capitalized on the industry shift toward\n> mobile gaming. The firm owns some of the world\u2019s most popular titles, like\n> Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile. To date, games remain Tencent\u2019s primary\n> monetization model\u2014as we estimate more than 40% of the group\u2019s operating\n> income comes from this segment. Tencent should continue to leverage its\n> unrivaled access to user data and financial capital to create innovative,\n> high-quality, and long-cycle games with a mobile-first approach.\n> \n> Outside of games, other key businesses under the Tencent empire include\n> WeChat, QQ, WePay, music streaming, on-demand cloud, and a host of other\n> ventures. We see a tremendous amount of untapped value in WeChat, as it\n> continues to increase monetization through advertising and acts as a major\n> gateway for other internet services (payment, delivery, insurance, and so on)\n> looking to access the 1.2 billion-plus WeChat users.\n> \n> Given WeChat's huge and engaged user base, advertisers will continue to find\n> it one of the top marketing channels. We think there are ample advertising\n> revenue opportunities ahead, driven by 1) rising advertising inventory, 2)\n> higher ad loads, and 3) improving ad-targeting efficiency.\n> \n> While games and advertising will remain Tencent's core cash flow driver, we\n> think the firm's investments in other areas (cloud storage, business services,\n> enterprise software, and so on) also offer long-term value-creation potential.\n> Given the size of China's economy and the prevalence of digital adoption, we\n> surmise that there are enormous opportunities ahead for enterprise technology\n> (think Zoom, Slack, and Teams), and Tencent will most likely turn these\n> services into recurring revenue streams.\n> \n> Tencent is also an investment powerhouse, and it loves using deals to expand\n> its reach. Once invested, Tencent tends to add value through highlighting\n> investees\u2019 services on WeChat and other in-house traffic platforms\u2014reducing\n> customer acquisition costs while helping them scale rapidly. This strategy has\n> paid off nicely, as external investments have generated an estimated internal\n> rate of return of above 20% over the past decade.\n> \n> Ivan Su, Morningstar Analyst\n\n\nYUM CHINA\n\n * Morningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.48\n * Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Medium\n * Morningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n * Industry: Restaurants\n\nYum China operates in the restaurant industry and earns a standard rating for\nmanagement\u2019s capital allocation activities. Yum China stock is 52% undervalued;\nwe think the stock is worth $80.\n\n> The covid-19 pandemic provided Yum China the opportunity to accelerate store\n> openings at more favorable lease terms. The company added more than 3,700\n> locations from 2020 to 2022, equivalent to a 36% increase from 2019. Now that\n> China\u2019s zero-covid-19 policy is in the rearview mirror, we expect these new\n> restaurants to not only deliver significant incremental revenue but also be\n> accretive to the overall margins. Over the next several years, we expect Yum\n> China to speed up new unit openings. We share management\u2019s view that there\n> remain plenty of expansion opportunities in lower-tier cities\u2014evidenced by\n> nearly 1,200 Chinese cities still with no KFC presence.\n> \n> Over the longer term, we believe there are several opportunities for Yum China\n> to gain a share in the fragmented, USD 700 billion Chinese restaurant market.\n> In China, chains account for roughly 18% of restaurant spending, compared with\n> 61% in the US and 34% across the globe.

It was on the eve of the Chinese New Year, and my shout\nof excitement echoed through our home, startling my family, startling my family\nmembers,\u201d said Yushuai Luan, a courier with JD.com.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics are set to transform the experience for\nspectators, marking the first time in history that the public can alongside\nOlympian on the same marathon. Among the 40,048 international participants is\nJD.com courier Yushuai Luan, who is eager to showcase his running prowess on\nthis global stage.\n\n\n\nYushuai is diligently preparing for the August race, running nearly 400\nkilometers every month. In a heartfelt gesture of appreciation, he penned a\nthank-you letter to the Paris 2024 Mass Participation Marathon organizing team,\nwhich was sent using JD Logistics\u2019 international express delivery service.\n\n\u201cIn school, I was always one of the fastest,\u201d Yushuai said humbly. Hailing from\nthe chilly hills of Jilin province in Northeast China, he grew up running in\ndemanding conditions, though he never envisioned competing in a marathon.\n\nYushuai Luan also participated in Olympic Winter Game Beijing 2022 Torch Relay\n\nYushuai\u2019s journey with JD Logistics began in 2015 in Beijing\u2019s Haidian district,\nknown for its exacting delivery standards. Initially, the learning curve was\nsteep as he familiarized himself with the intricate maze of streets and alleys,\nopting to run\u2014rather than walk\u2014his routes.\n\n\u201cI often sprinted up stairs in a single breath. It was an amazing feeling.\u201d His\nexceptional speed allowed him to deliver hundreds of parcels during peak\npromotional periods, significantly above the average courier\u2019s capacity.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, when JD Logistics sponsored the Beijing International Marathon and\nformed a team from its staff, Yushuai was hesitant to participate due to fears\nof impacting his work, potential injury, or not finishing. However, he completed\nhis first marathon in an impressive 4:23:23, without any formal training, and\nreturned to work the following day.\n\nFrom there, he never looked back. Yushuai\u2019s marathon times have improved\nremarkably since then, with his personal best now standing at 2:25:55. His\nsecret? A deep, abiding love for running. Despite a hectic work schedule, he\nconsistently finds time to run 10-20 kilometers daily.\n\n\n\n\u201cMastering this professional sport through rigorous training has been incredibly\nfulfilling,\u201d said Yushuai. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely rewarding, boosting my confidence and\ndeepening my passion for running.\u201d\n\nYushuai\u2019s reputation in the Beijing running community is as much about his speed\nas it is about his warmth and resilience.\n\nHe vividly remembers a night when he answered a customer\u2019s urgent call. The\ncaller was in a different city, and their parent urgently needed medication\nwithout which there could be dire consequences. Yushuai navigated the streets,\ndelivering the medication on time. The customer was grateful and apologetic, but\nfor Yushuai, it was another opportunity to excel in his service.\n\nSome of Yushuai\u2019s marathon medals\n\nYushuai Luan doesn\u2019t just see the glass as half full; he sees it brimming over\nwith opportunity\u2014a mindset that carries him across every finish line with a\nsmile.\n\n(yuchuan.wang@jd.com)",

        "link": "https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/notes-from-the-barclays-24th-annual-not-3012201/",
        "content": "This week in New York, many leading health systems came together for the\nlong-running Not-For-Profit Health Care Investors Conference, now sponsored by\nBarclays, HFMA and the American Hospital Association. The conference allowed\ninvestors and industry observers to take the pulse of the nation\u2019s non-profit\nhealth systems and to note some interesting trends.\n\nAmbient Listening:\u00a0Six health systems discussed their use of \u201cambient listening\u201d\nto reduce physicians\u2019 \u201cpajama time.\u201d What does that mean? Well, as we all know,\nwith EHRs, physicians now have to do data entry for their patients, filling in\nthe blanks on their EHR forms if they can\u2019t finish up their work during their\npatient session. That occurs during the workday or at night at home (i.e.,\npajama time), and it has been a source of physician frustration and burn-out.\nThere are multiple vendors looking to solve that through \u201cambient listening\u201d\nwhere patient and physician interactions are listened to and captured by a\nsoftware system that then uses natural language processing and other artificial\nintelligence capabilities to enter the data into the proper fields in the EHR\nmedical record for the patient. It\u2019s essentially a robot scribe, without the\ncreepy robot sitting in the corner of the exam room. This has been in trial for\nyears, including prior to the pandemic, but now every health system using this\napproach reported at the conference that it was working well and was generally\nsaving physicians between 45 minutes to two hours per day of data entry. As one\nsystem reported, the physicians are much happier to be able to spend more of\ntheir time doctoring instead of typing, patients are happier that the physician\nis looking at them and not at their computer or tablet, and between 1-2 more\npatient visits per day now is possible.\u00a0This is definitely a step in the right\ndirection and hopeful news for the rest of the healthcare ecosystem.\u00a0We\u2019ll be\nwatching to see if this effectiveness continues and grows as it rolls out\nfurther across the industry.\u00a0\n\nHave You Noticed the \u201cJourney?\u201d: I should have been playing turkey bingo at the\nconference, or perhaps a drinking game where you took a shot every time someone\nsaid the word \u201cjourney.\u201d\u00a0It now appears that the entire conference is on a\njourney, as presenter after presenter characterized everything as a journey \u2013\nour transformation journey, our quality journey, our leadership journey, our\nvalue-based journey.\u00a0They weren\u2019t the only ones using \u201cjourney\u201d more than usual\n\u2013 it\u2019s evidently a journey pandemic out there, with everything being\ncharacterized as a journey, per the New York Times recent article (\u201cWhen Did\nEverything Become a Journey?,\u201d May 13, 2024) and especially one\u2019s heath journey.\nKnew I should have bought travel insurance before starting this journey\u2026.\n\nProvider-Sponsored Health Plans:\u00a0For many years, health plans owned by health\nsystems often were the ugly stepchild. Not really prioritized by the system,\nseparate and unequal and not well coordinated between the plan and providers.\nThere were some clear examples of better integration, such as Geisinger, but\nthey were the exception.\u00a0This state of affairs may well be changing. Sentara,\nCorewell and UW Health all set out interesting theses for growing \u201cSystemness\u201d\nand connecting the dots between their plans and their provider assets.\u00a0Sentara\nat this point is approximately 50/50 in revenue between the two lines of\nbusiness, with recent expansion of their plan business into Florida to be\nfollowed by provider expansion. This expansion of their share of the premium\ndollar can allow a health system to undertake innovative changes, such as\nSentara is doing. They have decided to allocate enterprise responsibility for\ncare management to their health plan with the ability now to direct care\nmanagement assets in the acute, post-acute and outpatient/ambulatory\nsectors.\u00a0Previously, a patient upon discharge from the hospital could receive\ncare management calls from three Sentara care managers, including the health\nplan, the acute or post-acute and the physician care management groups. That now\nwill be centralized and improved.\u00a0Similarly, Sentara is centralizing\nresponsibility for its enterprise pharmacy, reducing the previous fragmentation\nthat commonly is seen in the industry among doctors, facilities and the health\nplan.\u00a0By centralizing the function under a single leader with profit and loss\nresponsibility, it allows for more effective accountability and innovation.\u00a0\n\nThis also is a prelude to readiness for taking provider risk downstream from the\nhealth plans \u2013 a key element in risk readiness when shifting into downside\nrisk-based reimbursement structures such as in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.\nIn lines of business where the government does not fully cover the cost of care,\na way to control rising healthcare expenditures is to invest in prevention,\nchronic disease management and access improvements to reduce unnecessary\nutilization of higher cost emergency and inpatient resources. It is difficult to\nachieve the necessary cash flow in a fee for service environment (which\nrepresents more than 70% of all downstream Medicare Advantage payments today,\naccording to the Advisory Board) but the prepayment under value-based and\nrisk-based reimbursement systems allows for the necessary capital allocation.\u00a0\n\nDays Cash On Hand: The presenting systems generally reported days cash on hand\nof at least the mid 200 days, and often into 300 days or higher.\u00a0This is\nencouraging news for health systems, but conversely EBITDA margins for reporting\nentities \u2013 even at the top of the list \u2013 remained lower than pre-pandemic. While\nrecovering somewhat, there remains significant margin pressure, in large part\nfrom continuing higher labor costs, higher financing costs and declining federal\nreimbursement rates.\u00a0So, not necessarily a light at the end of the tunnel, but\nat least not an immediate crash for many of the larger health systems that were\nreporting their results.\n\nContinuing Growth and Innovation: Many systems focused their presentations on\nrecent and continuing growth. We expect to see more acquisitions, joint ventures\nand strategic alliances in the hospital sector in the next few years as health\nsystems continue to look to not only achieving greater scale, but also aim to\nintegrate and coordinate their service offering across the entire system. As one\nsystem CEO noted, we often found ourselves having two subscale programs in\ngeographic proximity to each other, and not doing enough of a specialty surgery\nat a location can result in worse outcomes due to lack off enough experience for\nthe team. So, they are moving and consolidating lines of business to get to\nscale and to determine what services have to be at what facility. This building\noutwards, while rebuilding inside is, as one health system leader said, like\ntrying to repair the airplane while it is flying, but it is necessary for\nsuccess and survival.\u00a0\n\nThe Many Uses of Artificial Intelligence: Coming in as second most mentioned\nbehind \u201cjourney\u201d was \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d There were opinions galore at\nthe conference but little yet in the way of consensus as to how to best use\nartificial intelligence (AI). Some interesting notes included the use of AI to\nscreen all X-ray images for secondary diagnoses \u2013 the things that may be found\non an X-ray that were not the focus of the primary area of inquiry by the\ntreating physician.\u00a0Northwestern Medicine reported this effort and has screened\napproximately 2.5 million images to date, attempting to improve clinical\ndiagnosis and give physicians more time.\u00a0\n\nThe Mayo Clinic has a multi-faceted AI strategy. Mayo solicited input from all\nof its employees as to what functions and services could be improved through the\napplication of AI, received many submissions and funded fifteen ideas. A key\nelement of their strategy is its \u201cfoundation model\u201d that will identify best\npractices for patients who meet certain criteria and can be grouped into\ncategories.\u00a0Mayo suggested that this could effectively make integrated\nknowledge, such as that obtained through a top-notch tumor board review\napproach, available through this AI model for patients globally.\u00a0Other\ninteresting Mayo areas were using AI in the context of genetic testing and\ncounselling identification, as they reported a shortage of qualified genetic\ncounselors which may be remedied in part through the appropriate use of AI as\nrequested by treating physicians.\u00a0More mundane but important uses included\nproviding effective summarization of patient records for physicians who, in the\ncase of a patient with a long treatment history, may take a physician over an\nhour in the absence of effective summaries. Mayo also was linking the source\ndocuments directly into the summaries to make access easier for the reviewing\nphysician.\u00a0That approach solved the \u201csearch\u201d issue for physicians of making sure\nthey had looked at everything and could go as deep or shallow as they wished in\ntheir review. This is a simple use of generative AI (genAI) but Mayo reported\nthat it was saving a half-hour each time for its physicians who were looking to\ndo patient whole record reviews.\u00a0To make sure the AI app was being clinically\nappropriate, Mayo ran a volunteer \u201cred team\u201d event, where physicians on a\nSaturday could volunteer to evaluate the AI output and quality check it. Mayo\nsaid that they had high engagement from their physicians who were supportive of\nthis effort.\u00a0\n\nAnother health system reported that, using AI, automated licensure review was\nnow being done and is almost fully automated. It also is reviewing 45% of its\npurchase orders using bots to ensure accuracy and compliance with purchasing\nguidelines. Another area of low value but high intensity was the required notice\nof admission to payors for patients entering the hospital.\u00a0That has been\nrequiring approximately 11,000 hours of work per year from multiple employees,\nand now can automated and reduce the staff allocated to this mindless task to\none FTE.\n\nOn an AI discussion panel, an AI entrepreneur took issue with the clinical use\ncases and suggested that AI should stay away from clinical diagnosis \u2013 leaving\nthat for the physician \u2013 and focus on other areas where there is immediate need,\nsuch as expanding and improving communications with patients. For example,\nHippocrates AI has a generative AI driven service that can call patients shortly\nafter hospital discharge or after prescription of a new medicine to check on how\nthe patient is doing, check for side effects or issues, do a compliance check\nand see if the patient has questions.\u00a0A demonstration of this genAI ability was\ninteresting to listen to without a single cringe during the three to four minute\ninteraction, and, due to genAI capabilities, could be undertaken easily in\nmultiple languages to meet the patients\u2019 preferred language choice. More\nprogress to be made, but it illustrated an interesting opportunity.\n\nThe CEO of Hippocrates AI posited that the healthcare industry recently has been\nan environment of a \u201chigh acuity, low volume\u201d profile for resource utilization \u2013\nwhere healthcare resources are more rare and focus on higher acuity or \u201ctipping\npoint\u201d events/conditions \u2013 and now could move to a \u201chigh volume, all acuity\u201d\napproach where consumers could have an \u201cAI healthcare friend/app\u201d sitting on\ntheir shoulder and available as a first triage level with low cost and high\nscalability before a patient then would move onto a higher level interaction\nwith a person.\u00a0The genAI function also could be used to move effectively provide\nkey educational themes to patients and their caregivers.\u00a0\n\nThat said, the general consensus of the conference presenters was that AI was\nhere and taking more and more health system mindshare but: (i) the \u201ckiller app\u201d\nfor AI (like Uber, social media or food delivery) has not yet arrived, and (ii)\nthere is growing concern and exhaustion among health systems for taking on too\nmany AI point solutions. Instead, there is a clear preference for an integrated\nAI platform that can allow multiple use solutions to be integrated and easily\naccessed, with data and other interoperability.\u00a0\n\nKudos to Barclays, HFMA and AHA for another excellent conference!",

The\ncompany\u2019s cutting-edge retail infrastructure seeks to enable consumers to buy\nwhatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it. The company has opened\nits technology and infrastructure to partners, brands and other sectors, as part\nof its Retail as a Service offering to help drive productivity and innovation\nacross a range of industries.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\nIn evaluating the business, the company considers and uses non-GAAP measures,\nsuch as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin,\nnon-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders,\nnon-GAAP net margin attributable to the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders, free\ncash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss)\nper share and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to\nreview and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as\nincome/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization\nof intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of\nbusiness cooperation arrangements, gain on sale of development properties and\nimpairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. The company defines non-GAAP net\nincome/(loss) attributable to the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders as net\nincome/(loss) attributable to the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders excluding\nshare-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from\nassets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements\nand non-compete agreements, gain/(loss) on disposals/deemed disposals of\ninvestments and others, reconciling items on the share of equity method\ninvestments, loss/(gain) from fair value change of long-term investments,\nimpairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments, gain in relation to\nsale of development properties and tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. The\ncompany defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusting the impact from\nJD Baitiao receivables included in the operating cash flow and capital\nexpenditures, net of the proceeds from sale of development properties. Capital\nexpenditures include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for\nconstruction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The\ncompany defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus\ndepreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets\nresulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP basic net\nincome/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss)\nattributable to the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Non-GAAP diluted net\nincome/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss)\nattributable to the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding\nduring the periods, including the dilutive effect of share-based awards as\ndetermined under the treasury stock method. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS\nis equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share multiplied by two.\n\nThe company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by\nmanagement to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans.\nNon-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable\nto the company\u2019s ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the company\u2019s\nongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful\nperiod-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess\nliquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from JD Baitiao\nreceivables included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the\nexpansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on\nfinancial resources. The company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the company\u2019s current\noperating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management\ndoes, if they so choose. The company also believes that the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provide useful information to both management and investors by\nexcluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to\nresult in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be\nindicative of the company\u2019s core operating results and business outlook.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The\ncompany\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and\nexpense that affect the company\u2019s operations or not represent the residual cash\nflow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures\nmay differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer\ncompanies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The company\ncompensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures\nto the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered\nwhen evaluating performance. The company encourages you to review the company\u2019s\nfinancial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial\nmeasure.\n\nCONTACTS:\n\nInvestor Relations\nSean Zhang\n+86 (10) 8912-6804\nIR@JD.com\n\nMedia Relations\n+86 (10) 8911-6155\nPress@JD.com\n\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

        "content": "During the Republican National Convention\u2019s opening night, Sen. J.D. Vance\n(R-Ohio) spoke to Fox News for his first interview as former President Donald\nTrump\u2019s vice presidential nominee.\n\nSitting in the Fiserv Forum, the convention\u2019s Milwaukee venue, Vance took\nquestions from host Sean Hannity and addressed criticism about his previous\ncomments on domestic violence, abortion, and his 2016 disapproval of Trump.\n\nA couple of times, Vance accused the media of twisting controversial comments\nabout violent marriages and abortion exemptions. We took a closer look at four\nof his claims.\n\nVance Mischaracterizes Biden\u2019s Stance on Abortion\n\nVance addressed his own and Trump\u2019s position on abortion. He described Trump\u2019s\nposition \u201cto let voters in states\u201d decide abortion laws as \u201creasonable,\u201d\ncontrasting it with Biden\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is running against a Joe Biden president who wants taxpayer-funded\nabortions up until the moment of birth,\u201d Vance said.\n\nThis is\u00a0False\u00a0and misleads about how rarely abortions are performed late in\npregnancy.\u00a0\n\nEMAIL SIGN-UP\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\nThe vast majority\u00a0of abortions in the U.S. \u2014 about 91% \u2014 occur in the first\ntrimester. About 1% take place after 21 weeks, and far fewer than 1% occur in\nthe third trimester and typically involve emergencies such as fatal fetal\nanomalies or life-threatening medical emergencies affecting the pregnant woman.\n\nBiden has said he supported Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court\nruling that legalized abortion and was overturned in June 2022, and\nwants\u00a0federally protected\u00a0abortion access.\u00a0\n\nRoe didn\u2019t provide unrestricted access to abortion. It legalized abortion\nfederally but also enabled the states to restrict or ban abortions once a fetus\nis viable, typically around 24 weeks into pregnancy. Exceptions to that time\nframe typically were allowed when the pregnant woman\u2019s life or health was at\nrisk.\n\nThe Democratic-led\u00a0Women\u2019s Health Protection Act\u00a0of 2021, which failed to pass\nthe Senate, would have effectively codified a right to abortion while allowing\nfor post-viability restrictions similar to Roe\u2018s.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden\u00a0promised\u00a0to repeal the Hyde\nAmendment, which says federal funds can\u2019t be used to pay for abortions, except\nin cases of rape or incest or to save the woman\u2019s life. However, the amendment\nhas continued to be included in congressional spending bills.\u00a0\n\nVance\u2019s Comments About Women in Violent Marriages\n\nHannity asked Vance to explain controversial 2021 comments about women staying\nin violent marriages.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBoth me and my mom actually were victims of domestic violence,\u201d Vance told\nHannity. \u201cSo, to say \u2018Vance has supported women staying in violent marriages,\u2019 I\nthink it\u2019s shameful for them to take a guy with my history and my background and\nsay that that\u2019s what I believe. It\u2019s not what I believe. It\u2019s not what I said.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe comments in question came from a 2021\u00a0event\u00a0Vance participated in at\nPacifica Christian High School in California. In a conversation about his 2016\nmemoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d the\u00a0event\u00a0moderator asked Vance about his experience\nbeing raised by his grandparents, following his mother\u2019s divorces and struggles\nwith drug addiction.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat is causing one generation to give up on fatherhood when the other one was\nso doggedly determined to stick it out even in tough times?\u201d the moderator\nasked.\u00a0\n\nVance talked about the economic effect of men losing manufacturing jobs then\ndiscussed his grandparents\u2019 marriage.\u00a0\n\nIn his memoirs, Vance detailed his grandparents\u2019 relationship and told a story\nabout Vance\u2019s grandmother pouring lighter fluid on his grandfather and striking\na match after he came home drunk. She had previously threatened to kill her\nhusband if he came home drunk again, according to a 2016\u00a0book review\u00a0published\nby The Washington Post.\u00a0\n\nVance commended his grandparents for staying together, comparing it with younger\ngenerations.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on\nthe American populace, which is the idea that, like, \u2018Well, OK, these marriages\nwere fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they\nwere unhappy. And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to\nshift spouses like they change their underwear, that\u2019s going to make people\nhappier in the long term.\u2019\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I\u2019m skeptical. But it\nreally didn\u2019t work out for the kids of those marriages.\u201d\n\nIn response to a 2022\u00a0Vice News story\u00a0highlighting the comments, Jai Chabria, a\nstrategist for Vance,\u00a0said\u00a0the media missed Vance\u2019s point.\n\n\u201cThis is a comment that he made where he\u2019s talking about how it\u2019s important that\ncouples stay together for the kids, that we actually have good kids first,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cAll he is saying is that it is far too often the case where couples get\ndivorced, they split up, and they don\u2019t take the kids\u2019 needs into\nconsideration.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s Comments About\u00a0Rape, Abortion, and \u2018Inconvenience\u2019\n\nHannity asked Vance to discuss his position on abortion, allowing the senator to\naddress his past comments that have been criticized.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet me go back to the issue of abortion,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cAnd there was this\narticle that said, \u2018Oh, J.D. Vance said it\u2019s inconvenient.'\u201d\n\nVance told Hannity, \u201cThe Democrats have completely twisted my words. What I did\nsay is that we sometimes in this society see babies as inconveniences, and I\nabsolutely want us to change that.\u201d\n\nWe\u00a0looked\u00a0into comments Vance made on abortion while he was running for Senate\nin 2022. His opponent claimed Vance had said that rape was inconvenient, but we\nfound that\u2019s not directly what Vance said.\u00a0\n\nIn a 2021\u00a0interview,\u00a0Vance was asked whether laws should allow women to get\nabortions if they were victims of rape or incest. He said society should not\nview a pregnancy or birth resulting from rape or incest as \u201cinconvenient.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy view on this has been very clear, and I think the question betrays a certain\npresumption that is wrong,\u201d Vance said in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s not whether a woman should\nbe forced to bring a child to term, it\u2019s whether a child should be allowed to\nlive, even though the circumstances of that child\u2019s birth are somehow\ninconvenient or a problem to the society. The question really, to me, is about\nthe baby.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is excerpted from PolitiFact\u2019s full coverage. You can read\nthe full story here.",

        "link": "https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/15/jd-vance-trump-vp-healthcare-abortion-investments/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. J.D. Vance, who was tapped to be former President Trump\u2019s\nrunning mate on Monday, has a history of investing in health care companies \u2014\nand of pursuing health care policies that are sometimes at odds with his party\u2019s\nbase.\n\nVance, as a Yale-educated venture capitalist, has invested in biotech startups\ndeveloping new therapies, companies that aim to aid in drug discovery, health\ndata companies, and health tech platforms, according to his federal financial\ndisclosures.\n\nVance rose to prominence after his book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d about his impoverished\nchildhood in Appalachia was published in 2016. He\u2019s found friends in wealthy\nplaces since. He co-founded a venture capital firm, called Narya Capital, with\nfunding from billionaire Peter Thiel and support from venture capital titan Marc\nAndreessen and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The firm has portfolio companies\nfocused on health care.\n\nTrump in the past has taken cues on health care from his vice president. Former\nvice president Mike Pence had significant influence over the administration\u2019s\nhealth care officials. Trump\u2019s second confirmed Health secretary, Alex Azar, was\na former executive at Eli Lilly, a drugmaker headquartered in Indiana. Medicare\nand Medicaid chief Seema Verma had deep roots in Indiana as well, as did former\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams. Trump also used Pence to bolster his anti-abortion\ncredentials with evangelical voters.\u00a0\n\nWhile Pence was a more traditional conservative evangelical who brought decades\nof political experience to the ticket, Vance at 39 is younger and less\nexperienced politically. He is a politician who rode the wave of populism that\nTrump started into office, and he offers less of a contrast to the former\npresident than Pence did with his staunch conservatism.\u00a0\n\nTrump has now nudged the Republican party away from advocating for a national\nabortion ban, and toward a stance that abortion policy should be left to the\nstates.\n\nThe party\u2019s 2024 platform isn\u2019t heavy on health care policy, besides a promise\nthat Trump \u201cwill not cut one penny\u201d from Medicare and Social Security. The\nplatform shows Trump wants to intensify the party\u2019s battle against\ngender-affirming care, and increase transparency and access to new and\naffordable options in health care.\u00a0\n\nVance hails from the populist wing of the Republican party, and at times has\nbeen willing to buck his party on health care issues. In 2022, Vance voiced\nsupport to AARP for Democrats\u2019 plans to negotiate drug prices in Medicare.\nHowever, he\u2019s toed the party line on other issues, like a bill proposing to\nexclude children brought to the U.S. by parents without legal immigration status\nfrom federal health insurance programs \u2014 an issue Trump brought up during the\nfirst presidential debate.\n\nAt the same time, he has some ties to the drug industry. Vance has found a major\nsupporter in former Celgene chairman Bob Hugin, who faced criticism for price\nhikes on a cancer drug during his failed Senate bid. Hugin donated $50,000 to a\nsuper PAC supporting Vance in 2022, according to the campaign finance tracking\nsite OpenSecrets, and gave another $3,000 to his campaign in October 2023.\n\n\nVANCE\u2019S EVOLVING HEALTH CARE AGENDA\u00a0\n\nThe Ohio senator has in recent weeks pulled his health care policy platforms\nmore in line with Trump, at times drawing flak from conservatives.\u00a0\n\nFor instance, Vance has previously said he objects to exceptions to abortion\nbans in case of rape and incest, running counter to Trump\u2019s emphasis this year\non the need for those conditions in any abortion restrictions. The Ohio senator\ntold the state\u2019s Spectrum News in 2021 that: \u201cIt\u2019s not whether a woman should be\nforced to bring a child to term, it\u2019s whether a child should be allowed to live,\neven though the circumstances of that child\u2019s birth are somehow inconvenient or\na problem to the society.\u201d\n\nVance softened his position this month, telling NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that he\nsupports the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision preserving access to the abortion\npill mifepristone.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOn the question of the abortion pill, what so many of us have said is look, the\nSupreme Court made a decision saying the American people should have access to\nthat medication. Donald Trump has supported that opinion. I support that\nopinion,\u201d Vance said on July 7.\n\nThe turnabout drew criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including some GOP\nstate lawmakers.\u00a0\n\n\u201c[J.D.] Vance claims to be a Christian. But now he suddenly wants abortion\npills, by which two-thirds of abortions occur in our land, to be legal,\u201d Ben\nZeisloft, editor of conservative news site The Sentinel, wrote on X. \u201cThis is\nprobably because Donald Trump now supports abortion pills as well and because\nJ.D. Vance wants the vice presidential nod.\u201d\n\nYet Vance has also been one of the Senate\u2019s most visible proponents of another\ntenet of the Republican party platform, limiting transgender people\u2019s rights.\u00a0\n\nThe senator last year introduced a bill that would make providing\ngender-affirming care to minors a felony with a 10- to 25-year prison sentence.\nThe bill would also bar taxpayer funding for gender-affirming care procedures \u2014\nregardless of age \u2014 running parallel to a Republican party priority in the RNC\nplatform.\u00a0\n\n\nOPIOID EPIDEMIC\n\nVance\u2019s mother struggled with drug addiction, which has underpinned Vance\u2019s\nemphasis on addressing the opioid epidemic. He has said that prescription\nopioids landed his mother in the hospital before she started using heroin.\n\nIn 2016, Vance warned in an op-ed in The Atlantic that then-presidential\ncandidate Trump had to address the opioid epidemic. His stance has been that\nsubstance use disorder is especially widespread due to hopelessness caused by\neconomic, social, and cultural challenges. He has called \u201cdignified work\u201d the\nway out of addiction.\u00a0\n\nBut his efforts to address the issue himself have been stunted. Following the\n2016 presidential election, Vance founded a charity to help solve the opioid\nepidemic that he witnessed in his childhood, though it shuttered just a year\nlater. An Associated Press investigation found that the addiction specialist the\norganization chose for a yearlong residency had ties to Purdue Pharma, which\npushed the painkiller OxyContin for years.\n\nIn the Senate, Vance authored legislation that would allow parents to request\ninformation about controlled substances prescribed to adult children on their\nhealth insurance.\u00a0\n\n\nHEALTH CARE FOR IMMIGRANTS\u00a0\n\nVance last year introduced legislation that would deny federal health care\ncoverage to people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or DACA\nprogram, long referred to as \u201cDreamers\u201d by Democrats. The Biden administration\nfinalized a policy this May that would broaden Medicare and Medicaid coverage\nfor DACA recipients.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTrump has repeatedly brought up immigrants\u2019 access to federal health programs,\ncharging that illegal immigrants sap Medicare\u2019s funding.\u00a0\n\n\u201c[Biden]\u2026is destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in,\nthey\u2019re putting them on Medicare,\u201d he said in last month\u2019s debate.\u00a0\n\nAdvocates have said that Vance\u2019s legislation would strip some 710,000 people of\ntheir health insurance.\n\n\nVANCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH\n\nVance received Trump\u2019s praise for how he handled the fallout of the East\nPalestine, Ohio, train derailment and ensuing concerns about the chemical\nspill\u2019s lingering impact on residents\u2019 health.\u00a0\n\n\u201cJ.D. Vance has been incredible,\u201d Trump told reporters during an Ohio event last\nFebruary, as the senator stood to his side.\u00a0\n\nVance joined with both Republicans and Democrats from the state to push federal\nhealth officials\u2019 response to the disaster. Their letter included a call for the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to deploy a little-known provision of\nthe Affordable Care Act that allows Medicare coverage for people exposed to\ncertain environmental hazards.\u00a0\n\nHis advocacy for East Palestine has at times pushed Vance away from his party,\nparticularly as he joined with Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown on legislation to\nboost railway safety and oversight.\n\nThis May, the senator joined Ohio attorney general Dave Yost in criticizing a\nfederal settlement with the residents that they said \u201crisks undercompensating\nthe residents of East Palestine.\u201d That same month, Vance introduced a bill that\nwould require HHS to conduct a follow-up study on the health impacts of\nresidents\u2019 chemical exposures.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn June, after transportation officials released their findings on the\nderailment, Vance ratcheted up his calls to reassess the agreement. The report\ncalled the \u201cBiden Department of Justice\u2019s premature settlement into serious\nquestion,\u201d Vance said in a statement.\u00a0\n\n\nTHE COVID-19 RESPONSE\u00a0\n\nThe senator has blasted Covid-era vaccine and mask requirements, writing in a\n2021 editorial that Covid-19 vaccine mandates are an \u201cinvasion of medical\nprivacy.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLast year, Vance introduced a bill that would prohibit mask mandates, calling\nthem a failed policy of the pandemic.\u00a0\n\nChildren \u201cneed us to not be Chicken Little about every single respiratory\npandemic and problem that confronts this country,\u201d he said in remarks on the\nSenate floor about the legislation.\n\n\nHEALTH CARE INVESTING\n\nVance\u2019s financial disclosures as a senator provide a window into his health care\ninvestments.\n\nHis largest investments are in AmplifyBio and Kriya Therapeutics, in the range\nof $50,000 to $100,000, according to his 2022 financial disclosures. Kriya is\ndeveloping gene therapies to treat conditions including eye diseases, diabetes,\nand epilepsy. AmplifyBio specializes in helping drugmakers study, develop, and\nmanufacture new medicines. Vance hasn\u2019t filed his 2023 documentation yet.\n\nHis smaller holdings include investments of between $1,000 and $15,000 in a\nbroad range of companies touching pharmaceutical development, provider training,\nmedical devices, and data and software development.\u00a0\n\nIn the pharmaceutical space, Vance\u2019s investments include Chase Therapeutics,\nwhich is focused on developing treatments for brain disease including\nParkinson\u2019s disease and depression, NeuScience, which aims to treat terminal\ncancers, and Pop Biotechnologies, which is developing platform technology to\ntreat cancer and infectious disease.\n\nHe also has apparently taken an interest in virtual care and health data. Vance\ninvested in Abartys Health, a health care data management company in Puerto\nRico; DeepConvo, a voice-based telehealth interface developer; MCH Ventures, a\nhealth software company, POPS! Diabetes Care, an online platform developer;\nReady Responders, a virtual emergency health care platform; and Healthcare\nInteractive, which offers online dementia care training.",
        "summary": "J.D. Vance is a Yale-educated venture capitalist. He has invested in biotech startups and companies that aid in drug discovery. The Ohio senator has in recent weeks pulled his health care policy platforms more in line with Trump. Vance has at times been willing to buck his party on health care issues.",

        "content": "Skip to content\n\nHealth Care\n\n\nJD VANCE\u2019S VIEWS ON HEALTH CARE: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nSen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who was tapped as former President Trump\u2019s running mate\nMonday, has been in the Senate for less than two years but has staked out health\ncare positions that both buck his party and toe the GOP line.\n\nVance is a Yale-educated venture capitalist, but rode the wave of Trump-era\npopulism to a Senate seat.\u00a0Like most Republicans, he is strongly anti-abortion,\nopposes gender-affirming care and wants to exclude \u201cDreamer\u201d immigrants from\nfederal health programs.\u00a0\n\nBut he\u2019s also expressed opposition to completely repealing ObamaCare, has\nsupported Medicare drug price negotiation, and worked across the aisle to push\nfederal health authorities to support the people of East Palestine, Ohio, after\na train derailment caused a chemical spill. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s where he stands on key issues:\u00a0\n\n\nOBAMACARE\n\nVance authored a 2017 New York Times op-ed in which he criticized the House and\nSenate efforts to repeal the health law because each would eliminate support for\nlow-income individuals and\u00a0leave too many people uninsured. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll rail against the way the government has destroyed our health care market\nin one breath and resist the support offered to the poor and middle class to\nnavigate this brokenness with the other. This is not conservative; it is\nincoherence masquerading as ideological purity,\u201d he wrote. \u00a0\n\nWhen Trump expressed support last year for reviving repeal efforts, Vance was\namong the many Senate Republicans who shrugged it off.\u00a0\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s comments, Vance told Semafor at the time that while\nhealth care was too expensive and \u201cripe for reform,\u201d\u00a0some parts of the law were\n\u201cbroadly popular,\u201d like protections for people with preexisting conditions. \u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any effort to try to change them,\u201d Vance told the\noutlet.\u00a0\n\nBut there will likely be a major battle in Congress next year about whether to\nextend enhanced ObamaCare subsidies that helped people afford insurance.\nCongressional Republicans and outside conservative groups are largely opposed to\nsuch a move, though Trump has not weighed in.\n\n\nMEDICARE DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION\n\nIn a 2022 interview with AARP during his Senate campaign, Vance said he supports\nallowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think we have to let Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices so that our\nseniors aren\u2019t paying through the roof for prescription drugs,\u201d Vance said.\u00a0\n\nDrug price negotiation is one of the key provisions of President Biden\u2019s\nInflation Reduction Act, which Republicans oppose. Many in the GOP argue\nMedicare negotiations are government price controls that could hurt new drug\ndevelopment.\u00a0\n\nTrump originally campaigned on Medicare drug price negotiations in the run-up to\nthe 2016 election, but later dropped it in favor of a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d\npolicy tying Medicare drug payments to overseas pricing. \u00a0\n\nVance also backed letting U.S. companies import drugs from overseas, another\npolicy Trump supported while in office. \u00a0\n\n\nHEALTH CARE FOR \u2018DREAMERS\u2018\n\nVance opposes using taxpayer money to provide health care for \u201cDreamers,\u201d people\nbrought to the country illegally as children but shielded from deportation under\nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\u00a0\n\nHe introduced a bill to explicitly exclude DACA recipients from ObamaCare and\nbar the use of any federal taxpayer dollars through Affordable Care Act waivers\nfor providing health insurance coverage for immigrants living in the country\nillegally. \u00a0\n\nVance blasted a Biden administration policy finalized in May that would allow\nDACA recipients to enroll in certain ObamaCare exchange plans, saying Biden was\n\u201cgiving your hard-earned money away to illegal immigrants in the form of\ntaxpayer-funded health care.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nTRANSGENDER HEALTH\u00a0\n\nVance last year introduced a bill that would make providing gender-affirming\ncare to minors a felony with a 10 to 25-year prison sentence. \u00a0\n\nThe bill mirrors state bans on the procedures, but also would block taxpayer\nfunding for it, including banning coverage of gender-affirming care from\nObamaCare plans. It banned universities from providing instruction on\n\u201cgender-affirming care,\u201d and deemed noncitizens who performed any gender-related\nprocedures\u00a0on a minor ineligible to receive visas or admittance to the United\nStates.\u00a0\n\nVance has also cast doubt on the mental health impact of such treatment. \u00a0\n\n\nABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS\u00a0\n\nVance has a strong anti-abortion record and was given an A+ ranking by Susan B.\nAnthony Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion group.\u00a0\n\nHe\u00a0campaigned against Ohio\u2019s 2023 ballot measure that guaranteed the right to\nabortion, and previously said he\u2019d vote for a nationwide abortion ban at 15\nweeks.\u00a0\n\nDuring his campaign for Senate, Vance applauded the overturning of Roe v. Wade\nand supported Texas\u2019s ban on abortion, which does not allow exceptions other\nthan cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk. \u00a0\n\n\u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d he said in 2021 when asked whether abortion\nlaws should allow for exceptions for rape and incest. \u00a0\n\nHowever, the next year, Vance said during a debate, \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in\nreasonable exceptions.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMuch like Trump, Vance has been trying to show he can moderate on the issue. \u00a0\n\nIn an interview on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d earlier this month, Vance said he supports\nmifepristone \u201cbeing accessible,\u201d despite many conservatives wanting the drug\nbanned. \u00a0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.
