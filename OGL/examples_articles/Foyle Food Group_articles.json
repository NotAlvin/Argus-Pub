        "link": "https://www.farmersjournal.ie/agribusiness/news/rollercoaster-year-for-factory-prices-801370",
        "content": "No matter what the price of beef is, there is always a big range of prices paid\nbetween factories for the exact same type of animal. Based on average slaughter\nweights, up to \u20ac225 per head more was paid for R3 cows and \u20ac180 per head more\nfor O=3= steers between the highest- and lowest-paying factories that reported\nprices for at least 10 weeks last year. The smallest gap in prices paid was \u20ac71\nfor U=3= heifers.\n\nOne of the frequent warnings we give in presenting this data is to be conscious\nof how external factors may influence the prices paid. These include the likes\nof organic and speciality breeds for which factories pay a premium \u2013 if there\nare substantial numbers of these in a factory\u2019s kill, then the prices they\nreport will be inflated. Similarly, some factories pay an extra bonus to attract\ncattle in a narrow weight range, which others buy off the grid, and deals at\nflat-rate prices will often reflect higher prices for lower grades and lower\nprices for the top grades.\n\nAnother variable that can distort the picture is the effect of a factory killing\na minuscule number of cattle over the year and if these were bought at either an\nexceptionally high or exceptionally low price, they won\u2019t necessarily reflect\nthe mainstream value.\n\nTo address this, an extra column has been added to this year\u2019s league tables\nidentifying the number of weeks in the year for which prices in each particular\ngrade for each factory were reported.\n\nMain findings\n\nThe categories chosen to reflect 2023 are four different grades from steers,\nheifers, young bulls and cows.\n\nThese are U=3=, R=3=, O=3= and P+ 3= giving 16 categories overall and cover the\nvast majority of cattle that are going through Irish factories.\n\nAll the factories that reported for 2022 are still reporting in 2023. Kavanagh\nMeats Enniscorthy started price reporting during 2023 but are excluded from the\nleagues as they don\u2019t have a full year of data. Kildare Chilling is separate\nfrom the Dawn group because that deal was only concluded during the year.\n\nWhile factories outside the main groups claimed several podium positions, some\nof which were based on a small number of cattle reported, several of them\nincluding ABP, Dawn and Kepak occupied positions in top half of the table. (See\nbelow)\n\nFoyle may have had less podium positions than previous years but it was still\nthere or thereabouts and it is one of the factories that pays extra for a narrow\nweight range on steers and heifers.\n\nAshbourne pushed into the top three for O=3= steers and was a consistent buyer\nas it reported for 52 weeks in that category. It was second for P+3= young bulls\nthough with a small sample size.\n\nMoyvalley claimed a first and second place in P+3= and O=3= young bulls, while\nEurofarm was second for R=3= young bulls with Foyle top for the U=3= grade.\nLiffey claimed a third place finish in the P+3= young bull category.\n\nCows\n\nWhen it comes to cows, the top positions are dominated by factories outside the\nmain groups. C&J Meats is widely known as a strong buyer of top-quality cows and\nthis is reflected in the table where it occupies the top position for U=3= and\nR=3= cows and a second place for O=3= cows.\n\nThese are the best-quality suckler-bred cows and C&J reported on these for 46\nand 52 weeks for the U and R grading cows, respectively, in 2023.\n\nTraditional Meat Company took top position for the O=3= and P+3= cows, reporting\non 50 and 25 weeks, respectively, and a second place for the R=3= grade based on\n51 weeks reporting.\n\nLiffey is also a strong cow buyer and had two third places, with Dawn\nBallyhaunis and ABP Nenagh claiming one each.\n\nGroup performance\n\nABP has the edge on U=3= and R=3= steers and heifers though it is pipped by Dawn\nfor the O=3= grade, who are also top for the P+3= grade followed by Kepak with\nABP back in third.\n\nThe top positions are divided between the big three for young bulls but when it\ncomes to cows, when the factories outside the main groups are taken together,\nthey are the top-payers in all categories apart from P+3= grade. There were some\nexcellent cow prices paid in 2023 and this merits further analysis.\n\nFactory margins\n\nIrish beef processing is privately owned and there are no accounts published\nwith the exception of Foyle and C&J Meats whose businesses operate both sides of\nthe border and in the case of Foyle it has two abattoirs in Britain as well.\n\nDunbia, which is the UK division of Dawn Meats also publishes accounts and while\nthis is outside the Republic of Ireland, between them they will give an\nindication of the financial performance. As well as being a very limited sample,\nwe also have to note that in these cases accounts are for the 2022 financial\nyear.\n\n\n\nSuckler cows and calves.\n\n\n\nC&J has a factory outside Lifford in Co Donegal, a cutting plant in Co Armagh\nand is a stakeholder in an abattoir in Co Antrim. In the year to 30 November\n2022, it had a turnover of \u00a369.1m (\u20ac80.3m), up from \u00a358.9m (\u20ac68.5m) in 2021.\n\nOperating profit for the year was \u00a3727,025 (\u20ac845,377) and after interest and\ntaxation, profit for the year was \u00a3490,692 (\u20ac570,572). The breakdown of sales is\n\u00a337m (\u20ac43m) to the UK with \u00a332m (\u20ac37m) to Europe.\n\nDunbia, the UK division of Dawn Meats since 2020, also continues to publish\nannual accounts. It is headquartered in Dungannon Co Tyrone, where it has a beef\nand sheep abattoir, cutting plant and retail packing unit. Across the UK, it has\n13 locations and for 2022 posted a \u00a31.37bn (\u20ac1.59bn) turnover with an operating\nprofit of \u00a312.79m (\u20ac14.87m).\n\nThe Foyle Food Group has an abattoir and cutting plant located in Cargins, Co\nDonegal, and two in Northern Ireland at Lisahally, Co Derry, and Omagh, Co\nTyrone. It also has two factories in Britain. Turnover at the Foyle Food Group\nHoldings Ltd increased to \u00a3482m (\u20ac560.4m) in 2022, up from \u00a3410m (\u20ac476.7m) in\n2021 with operating profit at \u00a312.9m (\u20ac15m) compared with \u00a314.6m (\u20ac17m) the\nprevious year and net profits were \u00a39.3m (\u20ac10.8m), down from \u00a310.7m (\u20ac12.4m) in\n2021.\n\nNumbers useful for guidance and an indication of trends\n\nLooking at factory profit figures where they exist, profits that are stated in\nmultiple millions look spectacular. There is do doubt that a well-run beef\nprocessing business can be extremely profitable but when the numbers are\nanalysed in these examples, we can see that profit margins are running between\njust under 1% and 2.7%.\n\nQuestion\n\nThe other question that remains unanswered is how representative are these\nnumbers for beef processing in the Republic of Ireland?\n\nAll of the Dunbia business is UK-based as is the largest percentage of the Foyle\nbusiness and the C&J business has a significant contribution from northern\ncattle, as well as from its Donegal factory. As with the factory league tables\nfor cattle prices, these numbers are useful for guidance and an indication of\ntrends.",

        "content": "The suckler herd involved in the trial\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 in Co. Tyrone has partnered with a\nNorwegian-based agri-tech company in a new hill-farm grazing trial.\n\nThe trial is set to examine how \u2018virtual fencing\u2019 can optimise the grazing\nmanagement of a suckler herd in a hill farm setting.\n\nSpeaking to Agriland, Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke explained what the\nresearch hopes to achieve.\n\nHe explained that the project is being initially trialled on 26 cows and a\nbreeding bull. No collars are placed on the calves.\n\nThe trial will examine how effective the virtual fencing is in the hill\nlandscape where phone signal is poor.\n\nInitial indications are showing the virtual fence is effective despite the low\nsignal in the region and the farm has plans to expand the project to more cattle\nin the near future.\n\nClarke added that the \u2018virtual fence\u2019 is essentially a collar that is placed on\nthe livestock. A phone app shows the farmer where the cattle are located.\n\nL-r: Foyle Food Group\u2019s Andrew Clarke, Ann Elinor Aasen from Monel, Wayne\nAcheson from Foyle Food Group and Christoffer Grindheim from Monel\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here in the office and if I want to give the cattle grazing on the\nhill a fresh area to graze, I can use the technology to create a bigger grazing\nzone for the cattle to make their way into.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s free entry for the cattle to get into the zone but once they try to go\n> out of the zone they hear a noise and they get that noise three times and then\n> it goes to a shock.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a solar panel on the collars. They\u2019re charged up at the start of the\nyear and the solar panel will keep them charged for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cThe phone app will tell you what each collar battery is and if you have a\ncollar not working or the battery\u2019s not charging, it will let you know,\u201d he\noutlined.\n\nThe collars were fitted last week and have been \u201cworking well\u201d on the herd so\nfar, according to the Foyle representative.\n\nWilson Marshall from the Foyle Food Group agri-team (left) pictured with Monil\nstaff\n\nClarke said: \u201cThere\u2019s two reasons we wanted to trial the collars. Firstly, we\nwant to better manage the grazing of the cattle on the hill.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the cattle to graze areas of the hill where they wouldn\u2019t\nnormally go as a group.\n\n> \u201cSecondly, whenever we\u2019re serving cows with a bull on the hill, sometimes the\n> cows could be on one end of the hill and the bull could be on the other. The\n> cow could be cycling and the bull would never see her within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the virtual fencing is to keep the livestock batched and moved\nacross the hill. We hope to be able to basically rotationally graze the hill.\nThat\u2019s what were trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe fence can be managed from a smartphone\n\nThe Norwegian-based company involved in the trial with Foyle is \u2018Monil\u2019.\n\nAccording to their website, Monil is \u201ca startup [business] challenging\ntraditional fences with our innovative virtual fencing technology, allowing\nanimals to roam freely while giving farmers complete control over their herd\u2019s\nlocation and well-being\u201d.\n\n\nFOYLE FARM\n\nFoyle Food Group\u2019s \u2018Farms of Excellence\u2019 is located in Co. Tyrone and the\noverall farming operation encompasses 1,100ac of land. 570ac of this is\nmountain-type ground, 250ac is lowland grazing and the rest is lowland silage\nground.\n\nThe farm is continuously conducting research and trials with the aim of\nproviding practical and up-to-date information to Foyle\u2019s beef suppliers on ways\nto further improve the economic and environmental sustainability of their farms.\n\nSome of the areas on which the farm is currently conducting research includes\nbest practice on grassland management, soil health, animal nutrition, and\nbedding for livestock.\n\nMore information on the farm can be found here.",
