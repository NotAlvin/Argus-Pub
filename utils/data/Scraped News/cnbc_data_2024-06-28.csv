Human rights law firm Leigh Day has written to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to urge the regulator to refuse any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE, it said.
Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the FCA declined to comment.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein's potential London initial public offering would be a ""badge of shame"" for the London Stock Exchange because of the fast-fashion firm's ""questionable"" labor and human rights standards.
Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain's markets regulator in June, two sources told Reuters on Monday, kicking off the process for a potential London listing later this year.
The company has previously said it was investing in strengthening governance and compliance across its supply chain.
The FCA has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation."
Webtoon Entertainment prices U.S. IPO at top of range to raise about $315 million,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/webtoon-entertainment-prices-us-ipo-at-top-range-to-raise-315-million.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107291275-1692861074782-gettyimages-1619655900-SKOREA_NAVER_AI.jpeg?v=1719452652&w=412&h=442&vtcrop=y,2 days ago - CNBC News,2024-06-26,"In this article
Webtoon Entertainment has priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its indicated range, seeking to raise about $315 million, the online comics platform said on Wednesday.
The company, majority-owned by South Korean tech giant Naver, priced its 15 million shares at $21 apiece, and had marketed the range of $18 to $21.
The IPO now values the Los Angeles, California-based company at $2.67 billion.
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore Group are the lead underwriters for the IPO.
Webtoon was founded in 2005 as a side project of CEO Junkoo Kim while he was working as a search engineer at Naver.
The company, whose roots are in Korea, is a storytelling platform that is home to thousands of titles across multiple genres including fantasy, action, romance, and horror.
Webtoon has about 170 million monthly active users in more than 150 countries around the world.
The company's offerings include Japanese web-comic and manga app Line Manga, web-novel platform Wattpad and Korean web-comic offering Naver Webtoon.
Certain funds and accounts managed by world's largest asset manager BlackRock had indicated an interest in buying up to $50 million worth of shares sold in the offering.
Separately, Naver's U.S. subsidiary Naver U.Hub had agreed to buy $50 million worth of shares of Webtoon in a concurrent private placement.
Webtoon's shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 27 under the symbol ""WBTN."""

Shein confidentially files for London IPO as U.S. listing stalls,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/shein-files-for-london-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107413924-1715606370233-gettyimages-2150274388-europapress_5918123_shein_sign_during_its_opening_at_abc_ser.jpeg?v=1719237369&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,4 days ago - CNBC News,2024-06-24,"Shein, the fast fashion giant with links to China, has confidentially filed for a public listing in London as it faces backlash in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.
The person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the discussions, which are private.
The company had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in November but began looking toward London after it failed to win the support of American lawmakers.
Elected officials in the U.S. have repeatedly expressed concerns about the use of forced labor in Shein's supply chain and its use of a U.S. tax law exemption known as de minimis. Under the provision, packages valued at less than $800 are not charged import duties and aren't subject to the same levels of oversight from U.S. customs, which is tasked with screening packages to ensure items from banned regions don't come into the country.
Shein would still prefer to go public in the U.S., people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, and its filing in London doesn't mean that an IPO will happen there. Shein had previously sought China's approval to go public in the U.S. It's unclear if Beijing has signed off on the London listing.
Shein declined to comment to CNBC.
Reuters first reported that Shein had confidentially filed in London.
Shein, which was founded in China, has gone to great lengths to establish itself as a ""global"" company, moving its headquarters to Singapore in 2021. Still, the vast majority of its supply chain is still based in China, and the fact that it needed to seek Beijing's approval to go public in the U.S. means regulators there view it as a Chinese company — and could exert control over its operations and data.
Shein's London filing marks another twist in the company's so-far long road to a public markets debut. It crashed onto the U.S. fashion scene during the Covid-19 pandemic and won over consumers with its ability to quickly offer the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. It's been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based competitors, which have ceded market share to the digital upstart and struggled to match its speed.
As Shein's prominence in the U.S. grew, so did its ambitions to go public. It began waging a U.S. charm offensive as it sought to win the approval of lawmakers and the retail industry, but those efforts have not yet succeeded. Shein has applied for membership in the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, multiple times and has repeatedly been rejected, CNBC reported.
It's found itself caught in the crossfire of a tense geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing. American lawmakers, concerned about the influence companies with Chinese links can have on the U.S. economy, ramped up their scrutiny of Shein after it filed to go public. Some elected officials at the federal and state level have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the company's listing because they say it would violate a U.S. law that bans the import of products made from the Xinjiang region in China, where the government has faced accusations of genocide against the Uyghur ethnic group.
Shein has acknowledged to CNBC that raw materials from banned regions have been found in its supply chain, but previous tests show that it's done a better job, on average, of ridding such materials from its garments than the industry overall.
In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shein was considering a London IPO after the SEC told the retailer that its listing wouldn't be accepted unless it made its filing public — a request that experts told the Journal was unusual. Typically, companies file to go public confidentially so they can protect sensitive information surrounding their operations and financials as regulators review the filing.
Even so, Shein's executive chairman insisted that its ambitions to go public are about transparency, not about raising capital.
""Most companies seek to go public for liquidity reasons,"" Donald Tang told the Journal. ""We seek to go public to embrace scrutiny and public diligence.""

Experts say Shein's U.S. IPO is all but dead,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/shein-us-ipo-is-dead-experts-say.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107413923-1715606369703-gettyimages-2150178097-20090101240429-99-852616.jpeg?v=1715606470&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-06-21,"China-founded e-commerce company Shein's hopes of going public in the United States are growing slimmer by the day, according to experts, as rising tensions between Beijing and the U.S. roil business and trade.
The company, last valued at $66 billion, confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. in November. Since then, it has faced resistance as it tries to join the American retail sphere, including through numerous rejected attempts to become a member of the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, CNBC previously reported.
The e-commerce upstart filed to go public while becoming a household name in the U.S. by offering low prices and a facility to offer new styles quickly. The company is poised to take major market share from U.S. retailers, particularly Gap, TJX Companies and Macy's, according to UBS data from last year, and continues to challenge Target, Walmart and Amazon.
But as political resistance to its U.S. IPO mounts, Shein is seemingly shifting gears, as it reportedly prepares to confidentially file for a £50 billion offering in London in the coming weeks. The company likely would have preferred to list in the U.S., because the offering could bring a higher valuation than in the U.K., said Angelo Bochanis, an IPO analyst at Renaissance Capital, which provides pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs. 
But its path hasn't been easy, as federal and state officials call on the Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize or even block the initial public offering in the U.S.
""Scrutinizing companies with high-profiles and roots in China is very politically in-vogue right now in the United States,"" Bochanis said.
A London IPO could, in theory, be easier than a U.S. offering, according to Bochanis. With the British parliament dissolved and the London Stock Exchange ""desperate for big wins"" as it suffers an IPO drought, Shein could circumvent some of the hurdles that it might have otherwise faced, he said.
If Shein's London IPO succeeds, it is unlikely to keep pursuing a U.S. offering, said University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who studies IPOs.
Not all China-linked companies are getting tangled in the webs of rising political tensions. Chinese electric vehicle company Zeekr went public in the U.S. last month. It became one of the first prominent Chinese companies to do so in the U.S. even as the Biden administration has increasingly cracked down on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
Shein is ""one of the few"" China-tied companies that have gained deep brand awareness with U.S. consumers, Bochanis said.
The size of the potential offering, and the long, high-profile process accompanying it, have helped to make Shein an attractive target for politicians from both parties who want to look tough on Beijing-linked companies.
Shein was founded in China and has since moved its headquarters to Singapore. But a good chunk of the company's supply chain is still based in the country.
In December, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent a letter to Shein seeking information about the company's user data collection and its relationship to the Chinese government, calling a potential link to Beijing a ""serious risk for e-commerce, consumer safety and people's data privacy and security.""
The panel sent a similar letter to TikTok, the popular social media platform owned by China-based parent ByteDance.
The Chinese Communist Party can by law request any Chinese-owned company to share information on its customers, according to George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson. While Shein is headquartered offshore, its manufacturing ties in China and reports that it sought Beijing's permission to go public in the U.S. raised concerns among U.S. officials about what data it could share with the Chinese government.
That relationship helped to spark a proposed U.S. ban on TikTok. Legislation that Congress passed last month aims to force the platform to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19 or cease all activity in the country.
ByteDance and several creators on the platform have filed lawsuits to block the bill.
While Shein does not have access to the magnitude of data that a social media giant like TikTok has, the proposed ban has raised more doubts about a U.S. IPO for the company.
""[Congress] just showed us that if a particular Chinese-owned company is perceived to be posing a threat, they can unify and pass a law, and that's much stronger than an executive order or presidential order,"" said Antonia Tzinova, a national security attorney at Holland & Knight.
The political scrutiny beyond data privacy may prove more difficult for Shein to overcome.
The retailer has long been criticized for its alleged use of forced labor in its supply chain and poor working conditions for its employees.
In 2021, the United States passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which prohibits companies that manufacture goods in the Xinjiang region of China notorious for its Uyghur detention camps from selling in the U.S. Although U.S. government agencies claim Shein's supply chain has links to the Xinjiang region, the company doesn't manufacture its own goods and instead uses China-based micro-manufacturers that make materials tougher to track.
Shein has repeatedly denied the forced-labor allegations, saying it implements a system to support compliance with the U.S. law within the company.
The company has also come under fire for its use of U.S. customs law loopholes.
Because the company doesn't import its products in bulk to sell from a U.S. warehouse and instead ships on an order-by-order basis, it's exempt from some of the heaviest U.S. import taxes. Rivals have criticized this practice as giving Shein an unfair competitive advantage.

China talks up support for IPOs. Investors are watching the speed of approval,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/china-talks-up-support-for-ipos-investors-are-watching-the-speed-of-approval.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106668476-15977683532020-08-18t094644z_966918122_rc29gi95b8sg_rtrmadp_0_usa-spac-wallstreet.jpeg?v=1664533041&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-06-21,"BEIJING — Chinese authorities this week announced new policy for supporting venture capital, raising hopes for faster approvals of initial public offerings in the near future.
A once-burgeoning ecosystem of investment capital and startups in China has slowed drastically in the last three years amid increased regulatory scrutiny.
In one of the latest efforts to shore up the industry, China's top executive body, the State Council, late on Wednesday published high-level measures for ""promoting the high-quality development of venture capital.""
""Everything is going to depend on the implementing regulations,"" said Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster.
""It's positive the government at the central level has realized there is a problem,"" Ellis said. ""At least with respect to investments in technology, venture capital can be a positive force in the market in China that frankly can help China compete with the U.S. in the tech race.""
In terms of actions to watch, Ellis said that ""really what we're looking for as far as IPOs, is if the approvals start coming out at a quicker pace.""
""Venture capital investors are not going to make investments unless they can see a reasonably clear path to an exit,"" she said, noting that has not been case for the past year or so.
The new policy included a section on expanding exit channels for venture capital, with an emphasis on supporting companies with technological breakthroughs. The measures also called for implementing a management system for overseas listings and smoothing the exit channels for venture capital funds not denominated in yuan.
""The real bottleneck for overseas listings is the overseas IPO process and foreign exchange rules,"" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law.
The pace of both onshore and overseas public offerings has slowed. Investors, especially those who put U.S. dollars into China-based venture capital funds, have preferred IPOs in the U.S. as the largest and most liquid market.
Looking ahead, ""the market is watching the speed of U.S. IPO approvals,"" Ming Liao, founding partner of Prospect Avenue Capital, said in Chinese translated by CNBC.
Chinese authorities tightened their scrutiny and introduced new rules for overseas IPOs after ride-hailing company Didi went ahead with a U.S. listing in 2021 despite reportedly being under government investigation. Separately, the U.S. has increased its scrutiny of U.S. capital going into China, especially military-related entities.
Previously, lack of regulation also resulted in a number of high-profile cases of fraud involving China-based IPOs in the U.S.
Morrison Foerster's Ellis cautioned how the new policy encouraged businesses and research institutions broadly to participate in venture capital.
""Unfortunately I think if companies that are not professional investors start doing this and are doing this because they are encouraged by the government, it may just be more damaging to the market in the long run because they're going to lose money and it's going to stain the venture capital market in China,"" Ellis said. ""You need professionals doing this.""
The China Securities Regulatory Commission has increased fines for misleading investors and clarified requirements for overseas IPOs. Last year it announced updated rules, effective March 31, 2023, that said domestic companies need to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas.
Since then, 73 companies have listed in the U.S. and 85 in Hong Kong, Fang Xinghai, vice chair of the commission, said during a conference Wednesday, according to state media.
The IPO processing speed hasn't been fast enough and will be accelerated, Fang said in the report, adding the commission supports mainland Chinese companies to list overseas, especially in Hong Kong.
Fast-fashion giant Shein, which has tried to distance itself from its Chinese roots, has reportedly shifted its plans for a U.S. listing to one in London amid regulatory scrutiny.
China has also sought to develop its domestic stock markets, which are only about 30 years old.
Morgan Stanley equity analysts noted separate comments Wednesday from Wu Qing, head of China's securities regulator, that capital markets should increase their targeted support for businesses in line with the country's efforts to develop new technologies.
""We think it implies capital markets could welcome more diverse IPO candidates as long as they can demonstrate innovation and drive productivity growth, although IPO volume might remain low near term given higher standards are also in place,"" the Morgan Stanley report said.
Wu took over as CSRC head in February after a volatile downturn in mainland stocks. Markets have since recouped losses for the year so far.
The new policy also called for supporting international investment institutions to establish yuan-denominated funds.
""If foreign funds were able to set up RMB funds more easily, then there is money that wants to do that,"" Ellis said.
""There are a lot of China-focused funds that are headquartered in Asia,"" she said. ""They are USD funds but their management companies also want to manage onshore RMB funds because they feel like they can actually raise money in China for China investments, whereas raising USD from the U.S. and potentially Europe for China-focused funds is now very difficult."""

Golden Goose, known for its worn-looking trainers which have been made popular by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, was aiming for a market capitalization of up to 1.86 billion euros ($2 billion).
The ""current market backdrop is not the right environment to take the company public,"" the firm said in a Tuesday statement, adding that an IPO will be reassessed in due course.
The European Parliament elections and the calling of a general election in France impacted not only markets in Europe but the luxury sector in particular, Golden Goose said.
It stressed that the brand's IPO process had been ""engaged widely"" with investors. The first day of trading was due to take place on Friday.
France's far-right National Rally (RN) party won around 31% of the vote in the recent European Parliament elections, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap national election.
The record gains for the RN party sparked nationwide protests in France as demonstrators pushed back against rising nationalist sentiment. The French CAC 40 lost more than 6.2% last week to record its worst weekly loss since March 2022.
Golden Goose, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, announced last week that Invesco had committed 100 million euros to the listing as a cornerstone backer.

An alternative trading platform CEO wants to revolutionize private equity investing to help mitigate a stalling initial public offering market.
So, Forge Global's Kelly Rodriques partnered with Accuidity to launch the Forge Accuidity Private Market Index this spring.
The ultimate goal: Give more investors easier access to unicorns.
""This is a major financial innovation that's just happening now,"" Rodriques told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""There is a future … where index products and other financial innovations are making it possible for every investor to participate.""
The Forge Accuidity Private Market Index consists of 60 private companies including SpaceX, Stripe and Epic Games, according to Forge Global's website. But as of right now, access is still closed off to everyday investors. 
""Today, the regulations are such that you need to have a minimum net worth to meet the threshold of being accredited,"" Rodriques said. 
That means even with Forge's new initiative, only institutional investors and individuals with a high net worth can purchase shares. But anyone, accredited or not, can sell their shares of private companies on the platform. However, those same companies still have a right to refuse transactions on the platform.  
Rodriques hopes as interest in private investing increases, those regulations will shift. 
""We see a world very soon, where nonaccredited investors can come into a basket of index stocks and make a bet across 60 to 70 names, thematics, the same way you do in the public market, and that will really open it up,"" he said.

Healthcare software firm Waystar raises $968 million in IPO ,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/healthcare-software-firm-waystar-raises-968-million-in-ipo-.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107381117-1709309019431-gettyimages-2050750214-_s1_0157_y7jyzton.jpeg?v=1717714465&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,3 weeks ago - CNBC News,2024-06-06,"Waystar, a private equity-owned provider of software that helps hospitals and doctors' practices manage their finances, has raised $968 million in its initial public offering, the company said on Thursday.
The IPO of 45 million shares was priced at $21.50 a share, Waystar said. The pricing, which was in the middle of its indicated range, gives Waystar a fully diluted valuation of $3.69 billion.
Reuters reported the pricing earlier based on sources.
The progress in Waystar's IPO shows the market for new listings remains open after aluminum recycler Novelis pulled its stock market debut that would have raised as much as $945 million earlier this week.
Novelis blamed ""adverse market conditions,"" but sources close to the IPO effort said its owner, India's Hindalco Industries, could have gone ahead.
Companies have raised more than $15 billion this year via IPOs on U.S. exchanges, according to Dealogic, up sharply from about $9.1 billion at this point last year, the data show.
Waystar's major shareholders are buyout firm EQT, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and alternative investment firm Bain Capital. Following the IPO, EQT, CPPIB, and Bain will own about 29.2%, 22.3%, and 16.8% respectively.
Waystar was formed in 2017 through the merger of Navicure and ZirMed. The company develops payment software helping clients such as large hospital systems with the collection of bills from patients.
It reported a net loss of $51.3 million on revenue of $791 million for 2023, compared to a net loss of $51.5 million on revenue of $705 million in the previous year.
The company was valued at $2.7 billion in 2019 when Swedish private equity firm EQT and CPPIB acquired a majority stake in the company from Bain Capital.
Under EQT and Canadian pension giant CPPIB's ownership, Waystar has gained scale by acquiring some of its competitors, including eSolutions in 2020, which boosted its presence in the lucrative government health insurance market for the elderly, known as Medicare.
The company now works with 1 million healthcare providers and handles more than 2.5 billion transactions annually, according to its website.
Waystar will list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ""WAY"", with its shares expected to start trading on Friday.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group and Barclays are the lead underwriters for the IPO."

Fat Brands said Tuesday it has confidentially filed to take its Twin Peaks and Smokey Bones restaurant chains public through an initial public offering, less than a week after federal authorities charged the restaurant company and its chair Andy Wiederhorn for an alleged $47 million bogus loan scheme.
Fat Brands announced its intention to spin off Twin Peaks through an IPO last year. At that time, the company had already disclosed a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Wiederhorn.
On Thursday, Fat Brands, Wiederhorn and a few other people were criminally indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles for wire fraud, tax evasion and other counts related to the alleged scheme. In a separate civil complaint filed on Friday, the SEC accused the company and Wiederhorn of violations related to the same conduct.
Both Fat Brands and Wiederhorn, through an attorney, have denied the charges.
Since its founding in 2005, Twin Peaks has grown to nearly 115 restaurant locations in the U.S. and Mexico. Fat Brands bought the company in 2021. The sports bar chain is known for its female staff's revealing uniforms, similar to Hooters.
Smokey Bones is a newer addition to Fat Brands' portfolio, which currently includes 18 chains. Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants created the barbecue chain in 1999 but later sold the brand. Fat Brands acquired it in September 2023, with the goal of converting more than half its 61 corporate-owned restaurants into Twin Peaks locations.
""Our priority is to use the proceeds from any transaction to deleverage the balance sheet,"" Wiederhorn said about the potential IPO on the company's first-quarter conference call on May 1.
Wiederhorn owns 45% of Fat Brands' common shares through Fog Cutter Holdings, according to FactSet.
Shares of the company have fallen 9% this year, dragging its market value down to about $90 million.

Shares traded as high as 166,100 South Korean won ($121.59) apiece, representing a 99.1% surge from the IPO price of 83,400 won. The stock closed at 163,900 won, representing a gain of 96.52%. 
The ship-repair unit of South Korea's largest shipping conglomerate HD Hyundai Group sold 8.9 million shares in the initial public offering. The IPO totaled 742.26 billion won, valuing the newly public unit around 3.71 trillion won at the offering price.
Half — or 4.45 million—of the IPO shares are newly issued.
The company's IPO showed strong investor interest, with both the institutional and retail offering oversubscribed by over 200 times combined.
The Wall Street Journal, citing HD Hyundai officials, reported that the parent conglomerate, which held a 62% stake in its unit ahead of the IPO, will continue to be in control.
Meanwhile, KKR, the second-largest shareholder since 2021, plans to gradually reduce its stake, which currently stands at 38%."
Viking shares rise 8% after cruise line operator's market debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/viking-ipo-vik-cruise-line-company-trading-on-nyse.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107409108-17145964132024-05-01t203558z_73565243_rc2vh7aqxfrj_rtrmadp_0_usa-stocks-viking.jpeg?v=1714596793&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-05-01,"In this article
Viking is not your typical cruise operator.
Aboard its smaller, upscale vessels, you won't find any kids. In fact, the cruise line doesn't hide the fact that it is going after the high-income baby boomer.
Casinos? Not on these cruise ships.
In Viking Holdings' prospectus, the company said its cruises are for the ""thinking person,"" underscoring its efforts to appeal to the baby boomer traveler who seeks adventure and new experiences.
""They have the money, they have the time and, in my belief, the moment you try to do everything for everybody, you know what happens? You do nothing well. So we are very, very clear focused,"" Torstein Hagen, CEO and chairman of Viking, told CNBC.
The luxury cruise line was targeting a $10.4 billion valuation in its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, making it the third-largest cruise operator after Royal Caribbean and Carnival. Norwegian Cruise Line is the fourth largest. Viking started trading Wednesday at $26.15 a share under the ticker ""VIK"" after pricing at $24 a share.
It closed its first trading day with a gain of more than 8%, ending at $26.10 per share.
Viking upsized its IPO after existing shareholders decided to sell an additional 9 million shares amid strong demand from mutual fund investors, according to a source familiar with the situation.
In 1997, Viking had four ships. It has quickly grown its fleet to 92 vessels, 80 of which are river-based ships that travel down the world's biggest rivers, including the Seine in France and the Nile in Egypt.
""We're different because when you talk about the big cruise lines, they're large in the Caribbean,"" Hagen said. ""We have a tiny sliver in the Caribbean. The rest is Europe.""
The timing of Viking's IPO coincides with a strong rebound in cruise bookings. On April 25, Royal Caribbean raised its guidance for 2024 amid a bright outlook for the sector.
""Cruising has really come into the forefront as a competitive choice in travel,"" Jason Liberty, CEO of Royal Caribbean, said to CNBC in a recent interview. ""The overall travel industry is $1.9 trillion. The cruise industry is $56 billion of that. I think cruising is at a much different level than it was pre-pandemic.""
While the company's prospectus showed Viking brought in $4.71 billion in sales in 2023, it did report a net loss for the year. What is getting investors excited is the company's revenue per passenger of $7,251, which is much higher than that of any other publicly traded cruise line. Viking's premium price point allows it to make more money on each customer.
Investors will also be looking for details on Viking's expansion plans. Earlier this month, Norwegian Cruise Line said it ordered eight new ships scheduled for delivery over the next 12 years.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean and MSC Cruises all have robust portfolios, which has raised concerns of overcapacity weighing on demand. But for now, the industry is focused on how well demand has rebounded from the pandemic and that, even with higher prices, cruising is still cheaper on average than hotel vacations.
UBS leisure analyst Robin Farley said land-based hotel rates are 25% higher than in 2019. During that same time frame, cruise line rates are up 10%.
""The gap between cruising and hotels is wide. That makes cruise compelling right now,"" Farley said.

Rubrik stock pops 16% in NYSE debut after company prices IPO above range,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/rubrik-ipo-rbrk-starts-trading-on-new-york-stock-exchange.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107406459-17140664872024-04-25t170109z_885663634_rc2pd7a0mchq_rtrmadp_0_rubrik-ipo.jpeg?v=1714066599&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-04-26,"In this article
Shares of data management software maker Rubrik jumped in its New York Stock Exchange debut Thursday, the latest sign that public market investors are showing an appetite for tech IPOs. The stock opened at $38.60 per share, after the Microsoft-backed company priced its IPO at $32 a share on Wednesday, above its expected range of $28 to $31 per share.
Rubrik ended trading Thursday up 16% at $37.
In selling 23.5 million shares, it raised $752 million, leaving it with a valuation of $5.6 billion. Rubrik shares are trading under the ticker ""RBRK.""
Many technology companies appeared on public markets in the 2010s as central banks kept interest rates low. Worries about a weakening economy starting in late 2021 led investors to become less interested in unprofitable companies. Since then, few young technology companies have been willing to try going public. But that could be changing. Reddit and Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips, went public in March.
Rubrik, founded a decade ago, reported a $354 million net loss in the latest fiscal year, compared with a $278 million loss in the year prior. The company now generates 91% of its revenue from subscriptions, up from 59% two years ago. 
Microsoft invested in the company in 2021. Rubrik's co-founder and CEO, Bipul Sinha, has 8% control. Lightspeed Venture Partners, where Sinha was previously a startup investor, has 25% of the voting power.
Sinha said Rubrik isn't able to control market conditions but was able to prepare itself to go public.
""When we see the market is receptive and we were ready, we go,"" he said in an interview.
A company will decide on the timing for its IPO six to eight weeks ahead, relying partly on input from bankers, said Ravi Mhatre, managing director at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which was the sole investor in Rubrik's first round of venture capital.
Input from investors was also critical.
""Bipul spent a lot of time with public market investors both in 2023 and then in 2024,"" said Mhatre, whose firm invested some $362 million in Rubrik.
From those conversations, Sinha has gotten a sense of what investors would be interested in.
""Folks are looking for strong companies to go public, companies that have the potential to be a durable business, a moat in the marketplace, has something to unique to offer in the marketplace and clearly winning in the marketplace,"" Sinha said. ""Staying public is the key, not going public."""
Shares of bubble tea firm Chabaidao plunge nearly 40% in Hong Kong debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/chabaidao-share-price-plunges-as-much-as-40percent-in-hong-kong-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107404854-1713840395649-gettyimages-1007652080-dscf8774.jpeg?v=1713840451&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-04-23,"Shares of Chinese bubble tea chain Chabaidao tumbled almost 40% on its trading debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
The stock, officially listed as Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial, fell as low as 10.84 Hong Kong dollars in the late morning — about 38% below its IPO price of HK$17.50. The stock ended the day at HK$12.80, 26.8% lower than the IPO price.
The bubble tea firm's IPO was the largest listing in Hong Kong in 2024 so far, with the company garnering net proceeds of HK$2.59 billion from its IPO, before listing expenses, according to its prospectus filed to the Hong Kong exchange.
The company said it ranked third in China's freshly made tea shop market in terms of retail sales value in 2023, with a market share of 6.8%
Chabaidao offered 90% of its 147.7 million shares in a global offering, while the remainder 10% were offered in a public offer in Hong Kong.
However, the public offer was only 0.5 times subscribed, leading the firm to reallocate the remainder of the shares to the global offer, which was 1.11 times subscribed.
In the prospectus, Chabaidao revealed that revenue for the financial year ended 2023 stood at 5.7 billion yuan ($786.8 million) and gross profit came in at 1.96 billion yuan in the same period.
From 2021 to 2023, the compounded annual growth rate for its net profit reached 21.6%, it added."
