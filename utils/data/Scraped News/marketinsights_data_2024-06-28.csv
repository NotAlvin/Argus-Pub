said on Wednesday it has priced a $756 million
secondary offering by an entity affiliated with L Catterton at
$54 apiece.
U.S. private equity firm L Catterton, backed by French
billionaire Bernard Arnault and luxury goods giant LVMH
, is looking to reduce its stake to 73.2% from 81.1% in
the German firm.
Birkenstock is not selling any shares in the offering and
will not receive any proceeds from the sale by L Catterton, the
footwear brand said in a statement.
In May, Birkenstock raised its annual revenue and core
profit forecasts, betting on full-price selling and strong
demand for its cork-based sandals and newer closed-toe styles
mainly at its own stores.

2,Bryan Sheffield-backed Tamboran raises $75 mln in US IPO,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TAMBORAN-RESOURCES-CORPOR-124598243/news/Bryan-Sheffield-backed-Tamboran-raises-75-mln-in-US-IPO-47251702/,TBN,08:08pm,Reuters,"June 26 (Reuters) - Tamboran Resources, a
natural gas exploration and production company backed by
billionaire Bryan Sheffield, said on Wednesday it had raised $75
million in its initial public offering (IPO) in the United
States.
The IPO valued Tamboran at $421.3 million and the price at
which the shares were sold was lower than the $24 to $27 range
the Sydney-based company had marketed earlier, when it set a
target of raising up to $175.5 million from the offering.
Tamboran is focused on extracting natural gas from the
Beetaloo basin in Australia's Northern Territory, but it expects
no material revenue until at least 2026.
BofA Securities, Citigroup and RBC Capital Markets were the
underwriters for Tamboran's IPO.
Sheffield Holdings - an affiliate of Bryan Sheffield, the
son of Texas oilman Scott Sheffield and founder of shale
producer Parsley Energy - is the company's largest shareholder.
Parsley was acquired by Pioneer Natural Resources in
2021.
Since it releases fewer pollutants, natural gas has been
billed as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil. Some believe it
can be a viable stand-in as the world gradually shifts towards
renewable sources of energy.
But critics have questioned this narrative, arguing that the
methane emissions tied to natural gas make it too harmful to be
a so-called ""transition fuel.""
Companies listing in the U.S. can command a more favorable
valuation due to the availability of a bigger capital pool. U.S.
IPOs from Australian companies, however, have been rare.
Tamboran's share sale could be a barometer for other
IPO-bound companies. Despite the listings of some big names such
as Reddit, public markets have been wary of backing companies
with limited financial history and are scrutinizing business
models much more closely than during the pandemic-era boom.
Zeekr, a China-based player in the buzzy EV industry, was
trading merely 1% above its IPO price as of Tuesday while
SoftBank-backed Tempus AI's stock has lost a third of its value.

Altria Group has submitted a premarket tobacco product application for its on! Plus oral nicotine pouches to the Food and Drug Administration.
The company said on Wednesday its wholly owned subsidiary Helix Innovations submitted the application for three on! Plus varieties, tobacco, mint and wintergreen, the company said.
Altria, the biggest cigarette company in the U.S., said the nicotine pouches are used by those who chew and smoke tobacco. The pouches are also larger than those of the leading U.S. tobacco-derived nicotine brands, the company said.
The maker of Marlboro cigarettes in 2019 entered the growing oral nicotine products market after signing a deal with Burger Söhne to acquire an 80% ownership stake in some companies that commercialized on! products. In December 2020 and April 2021, Altria subsidiaries concluded transactions to buy the remaining 20% stake of the global on! business for about $250 million.
In the latest quarter, Altria's oral tobacco revenue increased 3.7% to $651 million.
The news comes after the maker of Zyn nicotine pouches, acquired by Philip Morris International in 2022, suspended nationwide sales on its U.S. website as local officials in Washington, D.C. investigate whether the company is in compliance with the district's ban on the sale of flavored products.

Company (MC4) plans to list 162 million shares, equal to a 30%
stake, on its local bourse, according to a statement by the
Saudi capital markets authority (CMA) on Wednesday.
Saudi regulator CMA said it had approved the firm's public
listing application, without providing a timeline for the
flotation. MC4 did not immediately respond to a request for
comment outside of normal business hours.
The company is involved in the production of flour, feed,
bran, and diverse wheat derivatives and operates factories in
Riyadh, Medina, and the country's eastern region, with a daily
milling capacity of 3,150 metric tons of wheat grains and daily
production of 450 tons of animal feed.
Established in 2017, MC4 was part of a wider privatisation
programme under Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 strategy aimed at
diversifying the oil-dominated economy.
It was sold in 2021 to a consortium comprising Al Othaim
Markets, Allana International and United Feed Manufacturing
Company for 859 million riyals ($229 million).
MC4's IPO would add to a string of listings in the Gulf
country and follow the flotation in March of Modern Mills -
previously known as MC3, in which the company raised $314.6
million by selling a 30% stake.
On Monday, the CMA also said it had approved the IPO
application of Arabian Mills, previously known as MC2.

India
* Hyundai to pay 1.3% of IPO to banks, lower than US, Hong
Kong,
sources say
* Bankers see tide turning after years of low-paying deals
MUMBAI, June 26 (Reuters) - Banks advising South Korean
automaker Hyundai on its India IPO are set to make as much as
$40 million in fees, three sources said, a windfall in a market
where banks typically struggle to make money given
cost-conscious clients and fewer big deals.
That would be the second-highest fee pot ever for investment
banks working on an initial public offering (IPO) in India and
it comes amid a sharp surge in equity deals in the country,
making it a bright spot in an otherwise dull Asia.
Hyundai Motor's India unit this month filed for
regulatory approval for a listing, which could be the nation's
biggest and will see the South Korean parent raise around
$2.5-$3 billion at a valuation for the unit of up to $30
billion.
Hyundai India will pay banks, including JPMorgan,
Citigroup and HSBC, 1.3% of the IPO size, the
sources, who have direct knowledge of the deal discussions, said
on condition of anonymity as the talks are confidential.
Citi and JPMorgan declined to comment, while Hyundai India
and HSBC did not reply to requests seeking comment.
That translates to $40 million for a single deal at the top
end of the deal size, making it the second best payday for banks
after Indian fintech firm Paytm's 2021 IPO yielded $44
million for its seven advisers, Dealogic data shows.
Banks in India get between 1% and 3% of an IPO size as fees,
with larger deals giving more bargaining power to the issuers.
An IPO worth about $3 billion would see banks in New York
earning 3%-3.5% in fees, while it could be 2%-3% in Hong Kong.
Historically most big equity deals in India have come from
state-owned companies that, bankers say, offer very low fees.
Western bankers privately complain about the Indian market's
low revenue potential, but they expect that to change in the
coming years with both the size of deals and fees going up.
A $40 million payout from the Hyundai India IPO would
represent a fourth of India's total IPO fee income of $164
million in 2023, according to Dealogic. Indian brokerages IIFL
and Kotak Mahindra, and Jefferies topped the country's IPO fee
league table last year, London Stock Exchange Group data showed.
India's IPO fee rose 55% to hit $164 million last year, with
a record 234 companies listing. Banks in New York earned $890
million while Hong Kong IPO fees totalled $135 million last
year, according to data from Dealogic.
'START OF A MOVEMENT'
For Hyundai's India IPO, the fee split among its advising
banks has not been decided yet, but typically lead managers get
the lion's share.
JPMorgan, Citi and HSBC are the lead banks on the Hyundai
India IPO, three sources said. Other banks on the deal include
Morgan Stanley and India's Kotak, they said.
Morgan Stanley and Kotak did not reply to a Reuters request
for comment.
At $2.5 billion, the lower end of the expected size of the
Hyundai India IPO which is likely to be launched in the second
half of this year, banks would end up pocketing a combined $33
million in fees, still the second best IPO fee in the country.
Bankers are betting on a surge in big ticket, private
company IPOs as well as investment banking fees in India over
the next few years as valuations grow and foreign funds chase
Indian equities amid an uncertain economic outlook in China.
""There is money to be made in India, and this (Hyundai IPO)
is the start of a movement. More and more global banks believe
there is an opportunity here,"" said Utpal Oza, Nomura's former
head of India investment banking.
Nearly all of India's highest paying IPOs have come in the
last three years, Dealogic data shows, with dozens of venture
capital and private equity-backed companies seeking listings.
Jefferies Financial Group expects investment banking
fees in India to rise in the next couple of years as the number
of deals grows, its country head said in December last year.

Kioxia plans to submit a preliminary application to list shares
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the coming days, two people
familiar with the matter said.
The chipmaker plans to submit a full application in August
and list at the end of October, though the timing could be
pushed back to December, said the people.
Kioxia said it has no update on its initial public offering
(IPO) plans and declined to comment on its listing procedures.
Bain, which led a consortium that acquired the memory unit
of Toshiba in 2018, aims to recover capital by selling shares,
with Kioxia planning to raise capital by issuing new shares, the
people said.
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities (MUMSS) and Nomura
Securities are advising on the listing, the people said.
Bain, MUMSS and Nomura declined to comment.
Kioxia hopes to capitalise on improving market conditions,
the people said.
It postponed an IPO plan in 2020 amid uncertainty in the
global chip market due to trade tensions between the U.S. and
China.
At that time, Kioxia targeted a market capitalisation of
over 2 trillion yen ($12.68 billion), later reduced to 1.7
trillion yen.
Kioxia's operating loss widened to 253 billion yen in the
year ended March even as the chipmaker reported its first
profitable quarter in six quarters due to higher chip prices.
Investment in servers for artificial intelligence tasks and
replenishment of inventory by smartphone and PC customers are
boosting prices, said researcher TrendForce.
Kioxia was in merger talks with Western Digital last
year but they stalled due to opposition from Kioxia investor SK
Hynix, Reuters has reported, though many in the
industry still see consolidation as needed.
Kioxia said last week it had refinanced loans worth some 540
billion yen and secured an additional 210 billion yen loan
facility.

in paragraph 4, analysts note in paragraph 12)
LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. meal delivery group
Doordash flagged an interest in a takeover of Britain's
Deliveroo last month, two people familiar with the
matter told Reuters.
San Francisco-based Doordash made the approach to Deliveroo,
but talks ended after disagreement on valuation, said one of the
people, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is
private. There are no talks ongoing, the person added.
Doordash and Deliveroo both declined to comment.
Deliveroo's shares, which have fallen by 67% since an August
2021 high of 395.9 pence, closed at 127.5 pence on Tuesday,
valuing the London-listed firm at 2.1 billion pounds ($2.66
billion). The shares jumped as much as 6% to 135.1 pence on
Wednesday morning following the news and were trading at 132.2
pence as of 0752 GMT.
Doordash's New York-listed shares fell after the news
before closing up 1.25% on Tuesday.
A slowdown in demand for online food delivery since the
COVID-19 pandemic and investors’ preference for more profitable
companies amid higher interest rates have weighed on Deliveroo's
shares since its March 2021 initial public offering.
The company works with 180,000 restaurants and retail
partners, and operates a network of 140,000 riders.
Amazon is Deliveroo's largest shareholder with a
13.23% stake, followed by DST Global with 7.54%, while Deliveroo
CEO Will Shu has a 6.46% holding, LSEG data shows.
Shu founded Deliveroo in February 2013, alongside his
childhood friend Greg Orlowski, the company says on its website.
At the outset of the company's 2021 listing, Shu was the
sole holder of Class B shares that gave him additional voting
power, by owning 57.5% of the voting rights.
However this year, those shares were automatically converted
into class A shares, Deliveroo's IPO prospectus shows.
Analysts at Jefferies following the Reuters report said the
valuation gap between food delivery players in the U.S. and
Europe is a catalyst for cross-border M&A in online food
delivery this year.
""In this instance, the talks have failed. But such is
the strength of the financial, industrial and strategic logic of
a Deliveroo takeover, we would not be surprised to see similar
such headlines re-emerge in the short term,"" they said.
Doordash, which has a $46.57 billion market value,
considered buying Deliveroo in 2022, the Sunday Times reported.
Both companies declined to comment at the time.
In an interview with the Financial Times in January this
year, Doordash CEO Tony Xu said the group is looking to
diversify outside of its core market in the U.S.
Doordash acquired Finnish rival Wolt in an all-share
transaction worth $8 billion in 2021.
Online food delivery companies have looked to pivot away
from unprofitable markets. Germany’s Delivery Hero said in May
it planned to sell its Taiwan business to Uber and sold its
minority stake in Deliveroo in January, according to reports.
Deliveroo reported a return to order growth in its first
quarter, with a 2% increase year-on-year driven by its
operations in France, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong.
Gross transaction value (GTV), a measure of the orders
placed through its platform, rose 6% to 1.83 billion pounds.

Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain's markets regulator in June, two sources told Reuters on Monday, kicking off the process for a potential London listing later this year.
""Rewarding Shein's current methods via a flotation would be a badge of shame for the London Stock Exchange,"" Dominique Muller, an Amnesty International researcher specialising in the garment industry, said in a press release.
Shein did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. LSEG declined to comment.
Shein has previously said it is investing in strengthening governance and compliance across its supply chain.
Shein's listing plans had run into political opposition in the United States over labour concerns.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) earlier this year informed Shein the regulator would not recommend a U.S. IPO due to the company's supply chain issues, Reuters has reported.
Shein executives recently met with Amnesty representatives and subsequently responded in writing to a series of human rights related questions, Amnesty International said.

The London-based company offers direct investment into UK forestry and afforestation projects.
In the half-year that ended March 31, pretax profit grew 10% to GBP6.6 million from GBP6.0 million the previous year.
Net asset value fell 5.8% to 102.2 pence per share from 108.5p last year, with NAV falling to GBP175.8 million from GBP186.6 million.
NAV total return since IPO stood at 4.2%, lower than the 11% reported last year.
Chair Richard Davidson said: ""The company has delivered on its objectives to increase domestic timber supply, sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, enhance biodiversity and has created hundreds of jobs within rural communities where it operates.""
Between March 31 and May 10 the company planted 650,000 trees and plans are in place to plant 9.4 million trees by spring 2025.
On May 29 the company said it agreed to a takeover by Averon Park, a firm seeking opportunities to commit capital to trading businesses.
Averon Park offered 97 pence per share to the forestry investment trust managed by Foresight Group LLP, a premium of 33% to Foresight's closing price of 73.0p each the previous day.
FSF shares were up 0.5% to 95.46 pence each in London on Tuesday afternoon.
The acquisition is due to close in the third quarter of 2024.

18,Shein moves step closer to possible London listing — FT,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Shein-moves-step-closer-to-possible-London-listing-FT-47078827/,MS,Jun. 25,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Online fast-fashion group Shein has filed confidential paperwork for an initial public offering with the UK’s markets regulator, two people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.
In a report on Monday, the FT said the move takes Shein a step closer to what could be a blockbuster listing for London, following the company’s decision to ditch a planned initial public offering in New York.
The Chinese-founded group could fetch a market valuation of about GBP50 billion.
Shein submitted the pre-listing documentation with the Financial Conduct Authority this month, the FT said.
https://www.ft.com/content/62e677a0-4aa8-42c6-89a8-57e7b8548b1f
The filing is a precursor to the Singapore-domiciled company releasing its IPO prospectus, which the UK regulator would have to approve before the listing.
Shein, which has the majority of its staff and manufacturing in China, has yet to receive approval from Beijing authorities to list in London.
A Hong Kong listing is another option under consideration, the report stated.
Shein, which is working with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley on its IPO plans, had planned to go public in New York but veered towards London after getting caught up in tensions between the US and China, the FT reported.
Donald Tang, Shein's executive chair, told the FT last month that the company had made ""progress"" on changing the perception that Beijing controlled it ""but not enough"" to win over US lawmakers.

""Nvidia's slump intensified yesterday and sent the stock into correction territory after a 10 percent drop,"" commented By Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank. ""In the last three sessions, Nvidia stock has lost about $430 billion in market value. The slump came out of the blue, just after the company took away Microsoft's status as the world's most valuable company last week. There has been no negative news about the company's fundamentals, no downgrades by analysts, no uninspiring forecasts, and no rumors of slowing sales. It's just that the end of the last quarter and the first half of the year may have caused some investors to take profits and take a back seat.""
""One wonders whether last week's good news marked the end of Nvidia's rise to the top and whether the latest three-day selloff is the beginning of a sharper downward correction. I don't have the answer to that question, time will tell,"" the analyst concluded.

22,UK wine producer Chapel Down could be sold as funding review launched,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CHAPEL-DOWN-GROUP-PLC-162866205/news/UK-wine-producer-Chapel-Down-could-be-sold-as-funding-review-launched-47034881/,CDGP,Jun. 25,Reuters,"LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest wine
producer Chapel Down is considering putting itself up
for sale as part of a review into options to fund its future
growth as it plans to plant new vineyards and build a new
winery, it said on Tuesday.
""As part of the review, the board will consider all
alternatives, including investment from existing shareholders,
investment from new shareholders, a sale of the company, and
other relevant transactions,"" the company said.
Its shares on Britain's junior AIM market closed on Monday
at 65.5 pence, giving it a market value of 112 million pounds
($142 million).
Founded in 2002, Chapel Down is based in Kent, southeast
England, and has grown into Britain's best-known and largest
producer with last year's harvest expected to make about 3.4
million bottles of sparkling and still wines.
While England's wine industry is still small scale,
temperatures warmed by climate change have in recent decades
provided better growing conditions for grapes, and there is
strengthening demand for local fizz in the home market.
The quality of the wines being produced in England has also
attracted international interest.
Taittinger and Pommery, two of France's best-known Champagne
houses, have bought land and planted vines in England, while the
world's biggest sparkling wine company, Henkell Freixenet,
acquired an English wine estate, Bolney, in 2022.
""There can be no certainty that a transaction will be
pursued by the company, nor as to the terms of any eventual
transaction,"" Chapel Down said in a statement.
The company said that Rothschild & Co was acting as the lead
financial adviser in relation to the strategic review.
After posting revenue of 18 million pounds ($23 million) for
2023, the company said it was on track for double-digit sales
growth in 2024 and added it had a strong balance sheet with
headroom on its debt facility of 12 million pounds and a deal to
extend this facility.

26,Grail bets big on flagship cancer test after spin-off from Illumina,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ILLUMINA-INC-9659/news/Grail-bets-big-on-flagship-cancer-test-after-spin-off-from-Illumina-47031766/,ILMN,Jun. 24,Reuters,"CHICAGO, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. cancer diagnostic test
maker Grail, which will list its shares on the Nasdaq on Tuesday
after being spun out of Illumina, is betting that
commercial partnerships with health systems, employers and life
insurance companies of its flagship cancer-detection test will
power its near-term growth as an independent company.
The blood test, called Galleri, can detect multiple types of
cancer early and looks for 80% of the cancers that are currently
not screened for, Grail CEO Bob Ragusa said in a telephone
interview on Monday.
“The long game is to get that technology out with broad
access around the world,"" said Ragusa, adding that that will
come with regulatory approvals in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Ragusa estimates there are about 100 million people in
the U.S. that are at elevated risk of being diagnosed with
cancer, with another 90 million in the UK, 160 million across
the EU and almost 50 million in Japan.
“It's really an enormous opportunity that we're looking at,
and so we'll be doing the work to unlock that opportunity over
the next couple of years,"" said Ragusa.
Galleri is a so-called lab-developed test and currently only
sold in the U.S., with a test priced at $949.
The company promotes the test as a way of detecting cancers
at an earlier stage, when it is more likely to be cured. The
company is running two large clinical trials, including one in
the UK, which it will use to submit for FDA approval in early
2026. U.S. approval could lead to broader adoption of its test.
However, some groups, including the American Cancer Society,
want proof that Grail's test prevents cancer deaths, something
Grail's studies are not powered to prove.
Grail currently has more than 100 commercial partnerships
that span health systems, employers, and life insurance
companies, Ragusa said.
During Illumina’s fight with antitrust authorities in U.S.
and Europe, Grail initiated large-scale clinical trials, has
delivered over 180,000 commercial tests, and scaled up its lab
infrastructure, Ragusa added.
Illumina founded Grail and spun it off in 2016. Grail went
on to raise funding from investors such as Bill Gates and Jeff
Bezos. Illumina was left with a 12% stake, and decided in 2021
to acquire Grail to enter the cancer early-detection market.
The deal was opposed by antitrust regulators over concerns
Illumina would stop Grail's rivals from accessing its technology
to develop competing blood-based early cancer detection tests.
Illumina proceeded with the acquisition regardless, only to
be slapped with a 432 million euro ($463.19 million) fine by the
European Commision, which ordered the company to sell Grail.
In December, Illumina said it would divest Grail through
either an outright sale to a buyer or by spinning it off.
As part of the spin-off, Illumina has provided Grail with
funding to pursue its long-term strategy. Illumina will hold a
minority stake of 14.5% in Grail, following the spin-off.
Grail's shares will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday
under the symbol 'GRAL'.
Morgan Stanley and law firm Latham & Watkins advised Grail
on its spin-off from Illumina.

up to $1.01 billion in its initial public offering in the United
States, the therapy developer said on Monday.
Biotech IPOs have shown signs of a rebound this year, but a
string of poor post-debut performances have tempered
expectations of a full market recovery.
The company is looking to raise as much as $317.7 million by
offering nearly 17.7 million shares at a price range of $16 and
$18 each.
Alumis expects to list on the Nasdaq Global Market under the
symbol ""ALMS"".
Morgan Stanley, Leerink Partners, Cantor Fitzgerald and
Guggenheim Securities are the underwriters for the offering.

British United Provident Association (Bupa), which holds a 63% stake in the Indian venture, plans to sell a small stake worth up to $38 million and Indian private equity firm True North is planning a stake sale worth up to $225 million, the document detailing the IPO plans showed.
It will file papers with India's markets regulator to seek IPO approval in the next week, the sources said.
Niva Bupa, Bupa U.K and True North declined to comment.
Niva Bupa's plans are the latest example of India's booming IPO markets, where investors are pouring record amounts of money into small and big companies. Earlier this month, Korean auto major Hyundai filed for what could be the country's biggest-ever IPO.
Of the $360 million offering, Niva Bupa will be raising $96 million by issuance of new shares, while $264 million worth of shares will be sold by existing investors, the document shows.
It will use funds raised to strengthen its balance sheet and for operating expenses, according to the document.
Niva Bupa has hired Morgan Stanley and Indian banks ICICI, Kotak, Axis, HDFC and Motilal Oswal for the IPO, the document shows. The banks did not respond to queries seeking comment.
India is among the nations with the lowest insurance penetration rates among large countries but adoption is growing fast after the COVID pandemic ""increased risk awareness,"" Niva Bupa said in its 2022 annual report.
Insurance sales are rising with soaring healthcare costs in India, where most citizens rely on private healthcare as government hospitals tend to be overburdened.
Niva Bupa has partnered with more than 10,000 hospitals in India. However, it is one of the smaller players with a market share of 1.8% in a sector dominated by insurance ventures of Allianz and Generali.
India in 2021 allowed foreign investors to take a stake of  up to 74% in local insurers from 49% earlier. In 2023, U.K's Bupa increased its stake in the Indian venture by 20% to 63%.
Among other IPOs, electric-scooter maker Ola Electric, SoftBank-backed retailer FirstCry and mortgage financier Bajaj Housing Finance are looking to raise between $500 million to $1 billion from their respective offerings.

32,Hong Kong real estate firm ESR gets nod for logistics REIT listing in China,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ESR-GROUP-LIMITED-103501626/news/Hong-Kong-real-estate-firm-ESR-gets-nod-for-logistics-REIT-listing-in-China-47025253/,1821,Jun. 23,Reuters,"(Reuters) -     Real estate asset manager ESR Group said on Monday it received the Chinese securities regulator's approval to list its logistics real estate firm in the country and expected to raise around 2.44 billion yuan ($336.02 million) from the listing.
In December 2022, the Hong Kong-based company that has sponsored multiple Singapore-listed REITs including ESR-LOGOS REIT and Sabana Industrial REIT, had proposed a spin off and separate listing of its logistics assets through a publicly offered infrastructure securities investment fund, or C-REIT, on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
The ESR C-REIT comprises three currently self-owned logistics facilities in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, China, it said.
Post the listing of ESR C-REIT, ESR's subsidiary Shanghai Yizhishang Enterprise Management Services Co will continue to manage the three assets.
""We are confident this portfolio will set the foundation for us to continue to grow the C-REIT...and bring more opportunities for us to collaborate with onshore financial institutions and investors in China,"" Stuart Gibson, ESR Group co-founder and co-CEO said.
The final offer price of the REIT offering has not yet been disclosed, though, the annualised cash distribution rate by the REIT is projected to be 4.5% and 4.62% for 2024 and 2025, respectively.
ESR will subscribe to 34% stake of the C-REIT IPO, while cornerstone investors, public institutions, and retail investors will subscribe for the remaining 66%, the company said.

36,De Beers Canada JV partner says diamond miner in no rush to sell,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ANGLO-AMERICAN-PLC-4007113/news/De-Beers-Canada-JV-partner-says-diamond-miner-in-no-rush-to-sell-47021230/,AAL,Jun. 21,Reuters,"TORONTO (Reuters) -     The proposed spin off of Anglo American's De Beers diamond unit will take 'some time' and the miner is not rushing to complete the split, Mark Wall, CEO of Mountain Province Diamonds, the Canadian joint venture partner of De Beers's Gahchu Kue mine, said this week.
After Anglo American rejected a $42.7 billion buyout offer from Australian miner BHP in May, it announced plans to sell its copper, iron ore, diamond and platinum businesses.
Yet the more than 100-year-old diamond miner is seeking options for its spin off from parent Anglo American at a time of depressed diamond prices, which analysts have said may make any transaction tougher. A public listing or sale to a sovereign wealth fund or other strategic investor are two possible options for the company, according to two people aware of the development.
De Beers did not respond to an email query by Reuters. Anglo said it plans to divest De Beers during the next 18 to 24 months.
Prices of rough diamonds have slumped by 15% to 20% since early 2023, according to the Zimnisky Global Rough Diamond Price Index, due to the rising popularity of lab grown diamonds and a shift by younger consumers away from diamonds.
Mountain Province Diamonds and De Beers own the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories (NWT). De Beers owns two other diamond mines in Canada.
""I have had many discussions (with De Beers Canada). What I  am getting is no one is rushing into anything. There is a acceptance that this is going to take some time,"" Wall told Reuters on Thursday.
He added that the joint venture is focused on daily operations, including maintaining safety and environmental standards.
Earlier this month De Beers said it was prioritizing investments in high return major projects and would pause exploration at the Gahchu Kue and Chidliak underground mines.

said on Friday it will raise 50 billion rupees ($598.6
million) by issuing shares to institutional investors.
The Indian real estate developer added its board has
approved the monetization of its hospitality assets through a
share issue and has formed a sub-committee to oversee the
process.
The Bengaluru-based firm has been working on hiving off and
listing its hospitality business, which operates 10 hotels in
Bengaluru and Kochi, including JW Mariott and Sheraton Grand.
Prestige Estates had flagged the need to raise capital in
May.
Sustained travel demand and successful listings of hotel
firms, such as Samhi Hotels and Juniper Hotels
, have inspired investor confidence in the sector, with

39,European IPOs fizzle out as political turmoil roils stocks,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GALDERMA-GROUP-AG-167234206/news/European-IPOs-fizzle-out-as-political-turmoil-roils-stocks-47017731/,GALD,Jun. 21,Reuters,"LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - The European IPO market is
unlikely to see any new candidates until after the summer, as
political uncertainty has roiled markets, bankers said.
This week Italian luxury sneaker brand Golden Goose and
Spanish fashion retailer Tendam both postponed planned listings
citing the impact that France's snap election had on markets.
The election call last week in response to a drubbing in a
European Union vote by the far right pushed down the euro while
French blue-chip stocks dropped and bonds tumbled.
But several bankers stress the market is not closed for
deals, as year to date share sale volumes have staged a
recovery. In one example this week, frozen bakery goods company
Europastry announced its intention to list in Spain and raise at
least 225 million euros.
""I don't think the market is closed but clearly for an IPO
market that was tentatively recovering it has been a bit of a
knock,"" said Andreas Bernstorff, head of equity capital markets
at BNP Paribas.
Even if there are fewer IPO candidates as political
uncertainty continues, with some even shifting their plans to
2025, share sales in already listed companies will continue,
bankers said. Block trades are still popular with investors with
around $150 million shares in Johannesburg-listed Momentum
Metropolitan sold this week.
""The recent volatility we have seen
around French elections is more likely to affect continental
European transactions which are sensitive to the macroeconomic
environment, but equally there is a good debate in Europe around
pro-growth policies which could benefit investor sentiment,""
said Alex Watkins, co-head of equity capital markets
international at JP Morgan.
Share sales across Europe, Middle East and Africa year to
date have reached $89.8 billion, up 45% from the same period
last year, Dealogic data shows. That is still off the recent
high of $168 billion for the same period in 2021.
The value of IPOs year to date stands at $19.5 billion, up
117% from the same period last year, with successful offerings
from CVC, Galderma and Puig.
But the shock announcement of a parliamentary election in
France which kicks off June 30 caused a spike in volatility and
a sell-off in stocks. Last week the Euro STOXX 50 volatility
index jumped to its highest level since October.
On Tuesday night Golden Goose, which makes $500 sneakers,
and its owner buyout fund Permira, decided to pull an IPO it had
announced at the end of May. The at least 508 million euro
offering was thrown into doubt as shares of France's LVMH
and another luxury peer Moncler sank.
Part of Permira's decision was uncertainty over the
after-market, notably given the performance of another of its
IPOs Dr Martens, people familiar with the matter said.
The British bootmaker's shares are down 78% since its 2021
float. Permira declined to comment.
The summer is typically a quieter period for new issues and
some bankers have been warning that investors are being
selective about the deals they will back.
""There is a moderate pipeline post summer, but it won't be a
bonanza,"" Watkins said. ""The pipeline is building strongly for
2025 onwards.""
Investors are concerned about the potential impact of the
French elections and are worried about what a surge to the right
politically will mean for the European Union, and for issues
like Ukraine and fiscal policy, one equity capital markets
banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. elections in the autumn are also likely to have an
impact on the timing of IPOs, but bankers believe investors are
less concerned about the potential for market volatility. That
could mean a better chance for those companies looking to list
from September onwards.
""There are some IPOs that are lining themselves up to come
after the summer and they might have a better shot than
previously thought,"" Bernstorff said.
Companies including German academic publisher Springer
Nature and drugmaker Stada could IPO later this year, Reuters
reported recently.

The Warburg Pincus-backed non-banking financial services provider is raising up to 10 billion rupees by issuing new shares, while existing shareholders are offloading shares worth 25 billion rupees in the float, its prospectus showed.
Olive Vine Investment is selling shares worth up to 17.58 billion rupees, while International Finance Corporation and Kedaara Capital Growth Fund III will sell shares worth 3.42 billion rupees and 4 billion rupees, respectively.
Avanse, which provides products like education loans and growth capital for education institutions, said it aimed to use the net proceeds to meet its future capital requirements for the growth of its business and assets.
AFS competes with HDFC Credila Financial Services, which plans to raise 27 billion rupees via fresh issue, as per reports.
India's HDFC Bank completed the sale of its stake in HDFC Credila for 95.53 billion rupees to private equity firms BPEA EQT and ChrysCapital in March.
Kotak Mahindra, Avendus Capital, J.P. Morgan, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities, Nuvama Wealth Management and SBI Capital Markets are the book-running lead managers to the issue, Avanse said.
India has smashed records at home and globally with the number of IPOs filed in recent months, with South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor's India unit and liquor company Allied Blenders and Distillers making public offerings earlier this month.

Group said on Thursday it would be listing its shares on the
Nasdaq via a blank-check merger that values the company at $1.6
billion.
The deal with blank-check firm Aimei Health Technology
will make United Hydrogen one of the few China-based
companies rushing to U.S. bourses after tensions eased between
the two countries' regulators.
Founded in 2017, the hydrogen energy producer and
distributor, which helps businesses lower their carbon
emissions, has seen a bump in demand as businesses worldwide
shift to more sustainable sources of energy. Its revenue more
than doubled to $13.1 million last year, the company said.
The merger with Aimei Health, which raised nearly $70
million in its initial public offering last year, is expected to
close in the third quarter.
Blank-check firms, also known as special purpose acquisition
companies, have no business operations other than hunting for a
private company for a merger.
They use the proceeds from their IPO for the deal, which
results in the private company going public.

44,Joby Aviation says FAA gives nod for in-house software for air-taxi operations,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JOBY-AVIATION-INC-114796242/news/Joby-Aviation-says-FAA-gives-nod-for-in-house-software-for-air-taxi-operations-47008661/,JOBY,Jun. 20,Reuters,"June 20 (Reuters) - Joby Aviation said on
Thursday the U.S. aviation regulator has authorized the use of
the air-taxi maker's in-house software to perform tasks such as
managing pilot workload and matching passengers with aircraft
similar to ride-hailing apps.
The nod for the operating system, known as ElevateOS, comes
as Joby gears up to launch its commercial air-taxi operations as
early as 2025.
The Santa Cruz, California-based company is one of the
several makers of air taxi - also known as electric vertical
take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft - that has emerged over
the last few years with a promise to decongest urban travel by
offering intra-city rides.
Joby has commercial agreements to integrate the software
with Uber Technologies and Delta Air Lines that
will allow passengers to book and pay for flights, Bonny Simi,
Joby's president of operations, told Reuters in an interview.
ElevateOS was authorized for use by the U.S Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) as part of its Part 135 Certification,
which Joby received in 2022, she said, adding the company has
tested the system by ferrying employees between its sites.
The air-taxi maker also plans to make money from selling the
software as a service. The company's eVTOL aircraft is designed
to carry a pilot and four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph.
Joby, which went public in 2021 through a SPAC merger, has
attracted investments from transport industry heavyweights such
as Toyota, Uber and Delta Air.
Several large publicly companies have bet on air taxi
makers, but the industry faces technological and regulatory
hurdles in beginning operations and achieving profitability.
Those challenges have weighed on the sector's shares. Shares
of Joby have fallen 24.8% this year, while peer Archer Aviation
is down 50.2%.

report to say New Zealand growth, not Australia growth, and RBNZ
forecast, not RBA forecast)
* Shares close flat amid inflation worries
* Namoi Cotton hit lowest since May 1
* NZ stocks up after GDP meets expectations
June 20 (Reuters) - Australian shares ended flat on
Thursday as losses in the technology and healthcare stocks
countered gains in the commodity stocks, while expectations of
an early rate cut were dampened by the local central bank's
warning on sticky inflation.
The S&P/ASX 200 index was largely unchanged at
7,769.4 points at the close of trade. The benchmark fell 0.1% on
Wednesday.
The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday kept interest rates
unchanged at a 12-year high as inflation remained above its
target band, prompting concerns that a rate hike might be on the
cards if inflationary pressures persist.
""The path ahead for the stock markets appears increasingly
blurred as traders await fresh signals from both the economic
and monetary fronts,"" Hebe Chen, a market analyst at IG said.
Global investors await the Bank of England's rate decision.
The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged.
Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve had signalled a single
rate cut for this year.
In Australia, healthcare firms snapped five
consecutive sessions of gains to close 1% lower, leading the
losses in the benchmark.
Technology stocks fell 0.5%, with accounting
software provider Xero easing 0.2%.
On the other hand, gold stocks led gains among
resources, rising about 0.4%, after bullion prices hit a
two-week high.
Heavyweight miners ticked 0.1% higher, while energy
stocks were largely unmoved.
Namoi Cotton dropped as much as 7.9% to its lowest
since May 1, after the regulator raised competition concerns in
cotton ginning services after it acquires Singapore's Olam Agri
.
New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index gained 0.9%
to finish the session at 11,771.81 points.
Data showed the country's first-quarter gross domestic
product grew in line with the RBNZ's (Reserve Bank of New
Zealand) forecast, doing little to change the rates outlook.

restaurant chain Guzman Y Gomez jumped more than
one-third on their first day of trading on Thursday, an upbeat
signal about investor sentiment following the country's biggest
initial public offering in a year.
The Sydney startup's stock first traded at A$29.90 at midday
local time (0200 GMT), a 36% premium to their A$22 issue price
and against a flat overall market.
More than 60 million shares, out of just over 100 million
issued, changed hands in the first 10 minutes of trading.
The company put up A$335.1 million ($224 million) of new
stock, about one-sixth of the company, for trading. The share
price increase raises the company's market capitalisation to
about A$3 billion, from A$2.2 billion before its trading debut.
In its listing prospectus, the company forecast a second
consecutive net loss for 2024 but a profit in 2025 and outlined
a plan to match the current Australian store count of McDonald's
in 20 years.
Guzman Y Gomez's (GYG) initial issue was closed to the
public and largely involved selling shares to existing
financiers and franchise owners. The share price surge on
Thursday sends a hopeful signal about broader sentiment after
high interest rates and inflation squashed demand through 2022
and 2023.
Australian listings collapsed after a record 2021 as
pandemic stimulus payments ended and the central bank raised
interest rates to slow inflation. In 2024 so far, Australia has
raised just A$98 million in IPOs, the second-lowest June half in
more than a decade, according to LSEG data.
""It proves the adage that you can list a good company even
in a bad market,"" said Campbell Welch, an adviser at Novus
Capital who ran a small IPO for health services provider Freedom
Care in November, one of 32 new listings in the country
in 2023, compared with nearly 200 in 2021.
""It's pretty fully valued and a lot of things have to go
right now to justify the valuation.""
A prospectus filed in May generated rolling headlines about
GYG's target of opening at least 30 stores per year from 183 in
Australia currently - a rate it has achieved just once, in 2023
- and about its omission of store lease liabilities and
share-based payments from earnings projections.
The company said its accounting treatment of expenses
was typical of franchise businesses.
""Once we're listed, the market will price us every day and
our focus will be on the things we can control: selling burritos
and delivering on our strategy,"" GYG founder and co-CEO Steven
Marks said in a statement before the start of trading.
The company was not immediately available for comment.
A Morningstar client note previously valued the stock at
A$15 a share, saying the company with 3.5% of the country's fast
food market had not established a competitive advantage which
would justify its rapid expansion.

SK Bioscience shares surged as traders cheered the company's plan to acquire a German contract-manufacturing organization.
Shares of the South Korean vaccine developer rose as much as 20% to 59,200 won ($42.46) in early Thursday trading, on course for their sharpest daily percentage gain in nearly two years. The benchmark Kospi was down 0.8%.
SK Bioscience said earlier Thursday that its board decided to buy a controlling 60% stake in IDT Biologika, a member of German pharmaceutical conglomerate Klocke Group, for about KRW339.00 billion.
SK Bioscience values IDT Biologika, one of the top 10 global vaccine contract manufacturers, at KRW656.00 billion.
The South Korean company said it will secure managerial rights to run IDT Biologika after the stake purchase, but will still cooperate with Klocke, which will retain a 40% stake in the German contract manufacturer.
Separately, Klocke will invest KRW76.00 billion to buy a 1.9% stake in SK Bioscience.
""The cross-equity acquisition of the two companies is intended to build a close partnership based on trust in business performance and growth potential,"" SK Bioscience said in a statement.
SK Bioscience expects the deal to double its revenue, secure advanced manufacturing capabilities and expand its client base in Europe and the U.S.

was the only bidder for a strategic role in water
utility Sabesp, which is currently under a
privatization process, reported local newspaper Valor Economico
on Wednesday, citing sources.
Sao Paulo intends to privatize Sabesp through an unusual
two-part share offer, maintaining a non-controlling stake, and
selecting what it is calling a ""strategic investor"" to take a
15% stake in the firm and hold the shares at least until the end
of 2029.
According to the report, another firm that had been
interested in the privatization deal, sanitation company Aegea,
gave up on the transaction due to a ""poison pill"" included in
the deal to prevent the risk of a hostile takeover.
Citing sources, the report said that amid rumors of Aegea
stepping out, Equatorial might have presented a less ambitious
proposal to Sabesp, although no further details were given.
Equatorial said it does not talk about specific deal
possibilities in answer to a Reuters request for comment. Aegea
did not immediately respond.
Sao Paulo state, which is leading Sabesp's privatization
process, said that finalists eligible for the role of strategic
investor will only be unveiled on Friday.

Suzano said on Wednesday it has terminated talks to
buy International Paper, according to a securities
filing.
Suzano said last month it was interested in assets owned by
International Paper, after Reuters reported the company had
approached the U.S.-based firm to express interest verbally in
an all-cash acquisition worth $15 billion.
In Wednesday's filing, Suzano said ""it has reached what
it believes to be the maximum price for the transaction to
generate value"" for itself, ""without engagement from the other
party.""
Reuters
reported
in May that Suzano had been in talks with advisers about
sweetening an offer for International Paper.

won an auction for a $10 billion student loan book from
Discover Financial, the Financial Times reported on
Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
According to the report, the joint bid topped a
competing offer from Sixth Street, BlackRock and the Canada
Pension Plan Investment Board, with the loan book selling above
par.
The report adds that the auction attracted some of the
biggest names in private credit such as Ares, Blackstone and
Oaktree.
Last November, Discover Financial said it was
exploring
the sale of its student loan portfolio, stating that a
potential sale would see the servicing of these loans
transferred to a third party.
KKR, Carlyle and Discover Financial did not immediately
respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

58,Jefferies Q2 profit surges on dealmaking rebound,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/THE-GOLDMAN-SACHS-GROUP-I-12831/news/Jefferies-Q2-profit-surges-on-dealmaking-rebound-47250692/,GS,Jun. 26,Reuters,"June 26 (Reuters) - Jefferies Financial's
second-quarter profit jumped nearly twelve-fold as it earned
higher fees from advising on deals as well as underwriting stock
and bond sales, the bank said on Wednesday.
Its earnings, viewed as an early indicator of results at
major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, underscore the strong recovery in the corporate
dealmaking space.
Expectations of a soft landing for the U.S. economy have
sparked a surge in large mergers and acquisitions (M&A) this
year. Buyers are also selling bonds to fund their purchases,
while a strong rally in equities has boosted investors' appetite
for new offerings.
Jefferies' investment banking revenue in the second quarter
ended May 31 soared 59% from a year earlier to $803.2 million,
helped by a strong performance in its advisory as well as equity
and debt underwriting businesses.
""Overall, momentum continues to build across our Investment
Banking business, as the market opportunity improves and the
investment we have made in our platform translates to increased
market share,"" Jefferies said in a statement.
The bank's capital markets revenue jumped 24%, thanks to
strength in equities, and helped Jefferies' total revenue climb
60% to $1.66 billion.
In the reported quarter, the company expanded its
partnership with Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) as
it looks to tap into the dealmaking market in Canada, which
offers a competitive advantage for U.S. investment banks.
Jefferies net profit attributable to common shareholders
rose to $145.7 million, or 64 cents per share, from $12.4
million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.
So far this year, Jefferies shares have gained nearly 14%,
while those of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
jumped 19% and 5%, respectively.

""The sale of the stake generates an overall reduction in the Group's consolidated net financial debt of about EUR1.1 billion, while it does not generate impacts on the Group's economic results as Enel continues to maintain control of Enel Libra Flexsys S.r.l. and, therefore, to
fully consolidate it,"" Enel explained in the released note.

61,Activist investor Jana pushes Rapid7 to consider a sale,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/RAPID7-INC-23055722/news/Activist-investor-Jana-pushes-Rapid7-to-consider-a-sale-47249934/,RPD,Jun. 26,Reuters,"NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) -
Jana Partners, the activist investor that has successfully
pushed for the sale of multiple companies, has built a stake in
Rapid7 and is urging the cybersecurity company to sell itself, a
person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The news of Jana's stake comes months after Reuters reported
in 2023 that the Boston-headquartered company was exploring
options that included a possible sale.
News of Jana's involvement, first reported by the Wall
Street Journal, pushed Rapid7's stock price up more than 8% in
midday trading on Wednesday. Jana Partners managing partner and
portfolio manager Scott Ostfeld discussed the investment at an
investment conference in Monaco.
Since January, the stock price has tumbled 25%.
Besides urging a sale, Jana is also pushing the company to
improve operations and forecasting. It recently reduced its 2024
outlook.
Rapid7 specializes in so-called vulnerability management,
providing software tools and services that help businesses
assess and monitor security risks. It has been forced to compete
harder for its business as corporate clients cut down on
spending.
The hedge fund is working with Cannae Holdings, a
publicly traded holding company, and the idea would be for
Cannae to partner with a private equity firm to buy Rapid7.
Jana previously pushed for a sale of New Relic which was
taken private by TPG and Francisco Partners last year. It also
pushed for a sale of Zendesk which was taken private in 2022 by
investment firms led by Hellman & Friedman and Permira.

63,"Complex bids could extend Citgo auction evaluation, sources say",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MORGAN-STANLEY-13654/news/Complex-bids-could-extend-Citgo-auction-evaluation-sources-say-47249840/,MS,Jun. 26,Reuters,"HOUSTON, June 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court will
likely extend a period for reviewing bids submitted in an
auction of shares in the parent of Venezuela-owned refiner Citgo
Petroleum, three people close to the matter said, which would
delay a resolution to the seven-year-long case.
The court-organized auction of the seventh-largest U.S.
oil refiner aims to satisfy up to $21.3 billion in claims
against Venezuela for expropriations and debt defaults. The
process could lead to new owners of Venezuela's foreign crown
jewel.
The court had planned to finish the sale, after two bidding
rounds, on July 15, days before Venezuela's presidential
election on July 28, which Washington sees as a possible exit to
the South American country's long-standing political crisis.
But offers submitted in the second round have proven to be
more complex than expected, with several combining cash with
credit bids from some of the 18 creditors cleared by the court,
the sources said.
Bidders also were asked to disclose whether their bids
included plans to pay holders of a bond collateralized with
equity in a Citgo parent, adding another level of complexity.
""The investment bankers are trying to equalize – make apples
to apples comparisons. That might take a little longer than was
hoped,"" one of the people said.
Citgo operates three refineries that can process up to
807,000 barrels per day of crude oil into fuels and owns a
network of storage terminals and pipelines. In 2019, it severed
ties with its ultimate parent, Caracas-headquartered state oil
company PDVSA.
President Nicolas Maduro's administration and his political
opposition have requested the U.S. government to delay or halt
the auction, so its results do not alter the election outcome.
In a first bidding round in January, the highest offer
submitted was $7.3 billion, less than the market valuation of
$11 billion to $13 billion for the refiner.
Lawyers representing Venezuela called the bids
""disappointing"" and recently have pressed the court to organize
a third round if offers in the second round that finished this
month do not approach a fair value for the company.
At least five groups of investors submitted binding bids in
the second round, and three secured financing commitments from
banks and advisors including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley
and Rothschild & Co, people close to the
matter told Reuters this month.
The court has yet to disclose the number of bids in the
second round or their amounts.
Citgo, boards supervising the refiner and a court officer
appointed to oversee the auction did not immediately respond to
requests for comment.
""There are 100 reasons why this auction should not be in a
hurry,"" said a person familiar with the sale process, noting the
proximity of Venezuela's presidential election.
""There is the possibility of a new government coming along
that will honor its obligations ... and it doesn't want this
asset to be sold. The court could exhibit a little
judiciousness, a little restraint, and see what happens,"" the
person added.

66,ISS urges Vista Outdoor shareholders to 'abstain' from voting for merger,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISTA-OUTDOOR-INC-20798585/news/ISS-urges-Vista-Outdoor-shareholders-to-abstain-from-voting-for-merger-47249309/,VSTO,Jun. 26,Reuters,"NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder
Services on Wednesday recommended that Vista Outdoor
shareholders abstain from voting for a proposed merger next
week, arguing they should hold out for a better deal for the
entire company.
ISS wrote ""Continue to abstain on the proposed merger;
support the adjournment proposal,"" in a recommendation seen by
Reuters.
The recommendation comes just after Anoka, Minnesota-based
Vista accepted a $2 billion offer for its sporting-goods
business, The Kinetic Group, from Czechoslovak Group, known as
CSG. Earlier this week the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States cleared the proposed transaction, finding
there were no unresolved national security concerns.
But ISS said shareholders should stop short of signing off
on the transaction at the July 2 meeting and wait for better
conditions. ISS said ""an all-cash deal for the entire company
that would entail less regulatory, execution, and market-related
risks than the proposed merger,"" would be preferable.

Holding (IRH), the mining investment arm of United Arab
Emirates' richest company, is among investors holding talks on
buying into Vedanta Resources' Zambian copper assets, a senior
Vedanta executive told Reuters.
IRH, a unit of Abu Dhabi's International Holding Company
which holds about $244 billion in assets, is interested
in acquiring a stake in Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) and is
conducting due diligence on the assets, Chris Griffith,
Vedanta's chief executive for base metals, said.
IRH did not immediately respond to emailed questions. It
told Reuters in April it was interested in the KCM assets and
that it was ""deeply committed"" to expanding its presence in
copper mining.
The KCM assets have also attracted interest from other
investors, Griffith told Reuters on the sidelines of a mining
conference in London, declining to provide names.
Vedanta, owned by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, wants to
sell a stake in the copper mines to raise about $1.2 billion
required to revive operations and boost copper output.
Vedanta waged a five-year battle to recover the copper mines
and smelter that were seized by Zambia's previous administration
of former president Edgar Lungu after it accused the company of
failing to invest in expanding copper production.
Vedanta could sell up to 30% of its shareholding in the
Konkola assets, Griffith said. The miner owns an 80% stake in
the KCM and Zambia state firm ZCCM-IH the balance.
""IRH have been in discussions with us and have been part of
the data-room process,"" Griffith said in an interview.
He said the company wanted ""a little bit more than just up
to 30%"", but believed negotiation was possible.
IRH offered to buy a 51% stake in the KCM assets for more
than $1 billion, Reuters reported in April, citing sources. The
Abu Dhabi company wants to build up its copper mining business
in Zambia after buying a 51% stake in Mopani Copper Mines in a
deal worth $1.1 billion.
Griffith said other long-term investors were also exploring
the potential to invest in the KCM assets.
""We've allowed that process to happen in parallel,"" Griffith
said. ""So we've advanced down the road with a number of partners
already that are in that process of doing their due diligence.""
Vedanta is seeking to gradually invest in increasing copper
output at the Konkola mines over the next five years, Griffith
said. The company is close to securing an additional $270
million it needs to pay off outstanding KCM creditors and meet
social commitments, the CEO added.
Although Vedanta wants to sell a stake in KCM, it wants to
retain majority shareholding, Griffith said.

Nasdaq's planned sale of its Nordic power trading and clearing business to Deutsche Boerse's European Energy Exchange unit has come undone.
Nasdaq and EEX, which unveiled plans for the sale last June, on Wednesday both said that the deal has been terminated without specifying a reason.
According to several published reports, the transaction was facing extended scrutiny by European Union antitrust regulators who were concerned it could help create a dominant player in the spot market for electricity.
Nasdaq, a New York provider of platforms and technology to capital markets, said it continues to operate the business, while EEX said it will continue to pursue its own business strategy for the region and related markets independently and individually.

71,"Bosch weighs offer for appliance maker Whirlpool, sources say",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/WHIRLPOOL-CORPORATION-14872/news/Bosch-weighs-offer-for-appliance-maker-Whirlpool-sources-say-47248836/,WHR,Jun. 26,Reuters,"June 26 (Reuters) - German engineering group Robert
Bosch is weighing a bid for U.S. appliances manufacturer
Whirlpool, according to three people familiar with the
matter, a move that would boost its position in the household
appliances market.
Bosch has been talking to potential advisers about the
possibility of making an offer for Whirlpool, which has a market
capitalisation of about $4.8 billion, one of the sources said.
The sources said it was not certain that an offer would be
made, and asked not to be identified because the matter is
confidential.
Spokespeople for Bosch and Whirlpool said the companies do
not comment on ""market rumors."" The U.S. company's shares rose
12.7% in early trading after the Reuters report.
Buying one of the world's biggest white-goods manufacturers
would significantly beef up Bosch's home appliance business at a
time when competition with Asian rivals is growing.
Whirlpool has been undergoing a major restructuring in
recent years, which has seen it fold its European business into
a new company controlled by Turkish rival Arcelik and
divest its Middle Eastern and African businesses.
""A potential acquirer could believe in the potential for
some future recovery with the right multi-year timeframe and
macro backdrop,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Dahl said.
Whirlpool is facing ""significant challenges"" owing to a
depressed spending environment, Dahl added.
The potential takeover comes as Bosch, the world's biggest
automotive supplier, is looking at acquisitions to grow its unit
that manufactures large home appliances.
A deal for Whirlpool, whose brands include Ariston,
Hotpoint, Ignis and Privileg, would rank amongst the biggest
disclosed deals for the German industrial group.
Reuters reported in March that Bosch was among the
industrial firms competing to acquire heating and ventilation
assets worth over $6 billion from Johnson Controls International
in the U.S.
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung told German business daily
Handelsblatt in May that the company was looking at a few bigger
acquisition targets, and that it did not rule out entering a new
business area or a global deal.
He told reporters earlier in June that the group was open to
listing some of its divisions on the stock market as it explores
financing options for deals. He did not say which divisions.
Whirlpool, a household name known for its large appliances
such as washing machines and refrigerators, has in recent years
been aiming to grow its customer base by expanding in smaller
appliances such as espresso machines and other kitchen gadgets
as it grapples with a slowdown in growth.
The Michigan-based company recently said it would cut about
1,000 jobs in an effort to boost profit margins.
Longbow Research analyst David MacGregor believes Whirlpool
may be supportive of the bid at the right price.
Whirlpool has lost almost 50% of its market value over the
past two years. Its Swedish rival Electrolux is down
35% in the same period.
Electrolux shares rose following the report, and were
trading up about 4.5% at 1040 GMT.

Haleon is selling its nicotine-quitting aid business outside of the U.S. to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, an India-based pharmaceutical company, for up to 500 million pounds ($634.2 million) as part of a plan to simplify the business and focus on key growth areas.
The consumer-healthcare business--which was spun out of GSK and is partly owned by Pfizer--said Wednesday that the money raised from the sale will be used in line with its capital allocation policy and to reduce debt.
Haleon--which houses Sensodyne toothpaste and Aquafresh mouthwash as well as over-the-counter medicines Panadol and Advil--will receive an upfront payment of GBP458 million from the sale, with the rest payable next year and into the first half of 2026, based on certain performance targets being achieved.
The sale includes nicotine replacement therapies such as patches, lozenges, and gum under brands like Nicotinell, Nicabate, Habitrol, and Thrive.
The sale is expected to complete early in the fourth quarter of this year and will dilute revenue by 0.5% and operating profit by 1%, Haleon said, adding that all other guidance is unchanged.
The business that is being sold generated revenue of GBP217 million in 2023 and represented around 1.9% of the group's figure.
""The divestment of Haleon's NRT business outside of the U.S. is a further example of Haleon being proactive in managing its portfolio and is consistent with our strategy as we implement change to become more agile and competitive,"" Chief Executive Brian McNamara said.
On May 31, Haleon completed the sale of its ChapStick brand for $430 million.
Haleon was formed in July 2019 from the merger of GSK and Pfizer's consumer-healthcare businesses before being spun off and listed on the London Stock Exchange in July 2022.
GSK sold its last remaining shares in Haleon last month, while Pfizer owns 22.6%.
Haleon shares at 1252 GMT were down 0.70 pence, or 0.2%, at 331.80 pence. However, they are currently up 3.2% over the year to date.

WOLFSBURG/IRVINE - Volkswagen is getting help with electric cars from Tesla challenger Rivian - and is investing billions in the process. Europe's largest carmaker wants to spend up to five billion dollars and jointly develop technology for future vehicles. For Rivian, this is a very welcome cash injection: the company is still in the red and is currently struggling with declining interest in electric cars in the USA. Rivian shares, which have been weakening recently, jumped by almost 60 percent in after-hours trading on the Tradegate platform on Wednesday morning. VW shares, however, fell slightly in Xetra trading in the morning.

In after-hours trading, Fedex shares jumped by more than 16 percent at the peak.
Bayer CEO expects faster restructuring of the Group than expected
DÜSSELDORF - The pharmaceutical and agrochemical company Bayer expects its reorganization to be implemented more quickly. ""We are making faster progress than expected and, as promised, will save two billion euros annually from 2026,"" CEO Bill Anderson told the German business newspaper Handelsblatt (Wednesday edition). By the end of 2024, 70 percent of the Group's reorganization will have been implemented, the manager announced. ""We will already see the results of the reorganization this year - through cost reductions, a reduction in bureaucracy and significantly accelerated projects.""
Covestro: No connection between savings program and possible takeover
DÜSSELDORF - The plastics manufacturer Covestro sees no connection between the announcement of concrete takeover negotiations and the savings program published one day later. ""I can assure you that these two topics are not connected, even if it may seem so from the timing,"" company CEO Markus Steilemann told the ""Handelsblatt"" (Wednesday edition). The ""Strong"" efficiency program is solely intended to strengthen Covestro's strategy.
Western Europe is catching up internationally in 5G mobile communications
STOCKHOLM - One in four mobile phone contracts in Western Europe now includes the option of using the faster 5G network. With a market penetration of 26 percent, Western European mobile providers are only in fourth place in an international comparison, according to an analysis by mobile equipment supplier Ericsson. North America (59%) is in the lead, ahead of North East Asia (41%) and the Gulf Cooperation Council region (34%). The number of 5G mobile contracts is therefore increasing in all regions worldwide and will reach 1.7 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
Zurich acquires travel insurance business from AIG

ROUNDUP: Cartel office sees AI as a 'fire accelerator' for consumers
BONN - The growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to become a disadvantage for consumers, according to Germany's top competition watchdog. ""From a competition perspective, artificial intelligence is a fire accelerator of the first order,"" said the head of the Federal Cartel Office, Andreas Mundt, in Bonn on Wednesday. The power of the ""Big Techs"" - i.e. US technology companies such as Google and Amazon - would become even greater as a result of AI and the problems that we already have with them would be exacerbated. Dependence on such companies could have dire consequences, he warns. ""Imagine if these companies became anti-democratic at some point, if they became anti-human rights - and you couldn't avoid them.""

(NYSE:BX) on June 25, 2024 said it will not raise its offer of USD 1.31 per share in cash for Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited (LSE:SONG) which values the UK music rights owner at USD 1.58 billion (EUR 1.48 billion). The latest proposal was made in early June after previously Hipgnosis accepted Blackstone's raised takeover offer worth USD 1.57 billion, abandoning its deal with US music company Concord. Blackstone earlier said that the latest increase in its offer was due to the lower-than-expected adviser fees being incurred by Hipgnosis in relation to the transaction.
The terms of the deal have also been revised in terms of its nature, which was changed from a takeover to a scheme of arrangement, meaning that it needs to be approved by at least 75% of Hipgnosis shareholders.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Christopher Arthur Helm (DFI)', 1: 'David Rudolph (CMP)', 2: 'Shiv Prakash (CIO)', 3: 'Rufina Pavry (IRC)', 4: 'Patrick Thornton (AUD)', 5: 'Rosa Mercuriadis (PRN)', 6: 'Kenny MacPherson (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 1: 'Compliance Officer', 2: 'Chief Investment Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '19-12-31', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Christopher Mills (BRD)', 1: 'Robert Naylor (CHM)', 2: 'Simon Holden (BRD)', 3: 'Francis Keeling (BRD)', 4: 'Cindy Rampersaud (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Chairman', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '72', 1: '50', 2: '48', 3: '51', 4: '58'}, 'Since': {0: 'Dec. 14', 1: 'Nov. 06', 2: '17-12-31', 3: 'Nov. 05', 4: '23-07-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Hipgnosis Holdings UK (Ltd.)'}, 'Category and Sector': {0: ''}}}","{'Managers': {0: 'Christopher Arthur Helm (DFI)', 1: 'David Rudolph (CMP)', 2: 'Shiv Prakash (CIO)', 3: 'Rufina Pavry (IRC)', 4: 'Patrick Thornton (AUD)', 5: 'Rosa Mercuriadis (PRN)', 6: 'Kenny MacPherson (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 1: 'Compliance Officer', 2: 'Chief Investment Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '19-12-31', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}}","{'Members of the board': {0: 'Christopher Mills (BRD)', 1: 'Robert Naylor (CHM)', 2: 'Simon Holden (BRD)', 3: 'Francis Keeling (BRD)', 4: 'Cindy Rampersaud (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Chairman', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '72', 1: '50', 2: '48', 3: '51', 4: '58'}, 'Since': {0: 'Dec. 14', 1: 'Nov. 06', 2: '17-12-31', 3: 'Nov. 05', 4: '23-07-31'}}","{'Name': {0: 'Hipgnosis Holdings UK (Ltd.)'}, 'Category and Sector': {0: ''}}",2024-06-26 00:00:00
76,MNC Capital Increases All-Cash Offer to Acquire Vista Outdoor to $42 Per Share,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISTA-OUTDOOR-INC-20798585/news/MNC-Capital-Increases-All-Cash-Offer-to-Acquire-Vista-Outdoor-to-42-Per-Share-47251143/,VSTO,Jun. 26,S&P Capital IQ,"MNC Capital Partners, L.P. announced it has increased its all-cash offer to acquire Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:VSTO) to $42.00 per share, or approximately $3.2 billion. The revised proposal represents a premium of 55% to the VWAP from when Vista?s transaction with the Czechoslovak Group a.s. (?CSG?) was announced on October 16, 2023 to the last closing price before MNC?s initial offer on February 19, 2024. The revised offer is also an over 40% premium to the last closing price prior to MNC?s initial offer.
When MNC made its initial bid in mid-February, Vista?s shares were trading below $30 - at that time, the market reflected the acquisition of Kinetic by CSG. On June 25, 2024, Vista shares closed at $33.78 - the shares would have closed significantly lower without the expectation that MNC would be continuing to pursue the acquisition of Vista. MNC?s revised proposal represents a premium of almost 25% to June 25, 2024?s closing price.
Given MNC?s belief that its acquisition of Vista is in the best interests of shareholders, employees and national security, MNC decided to make one final effort for such acquisition by increasing its June 6, 2024 proposal from $39.50 per share all cash to $42.00 per share all cash. MNC said that it cannot see any possible basis or reason to further raise it. MNC?s revised proposal is all cash, has no regulatory issues and is not subject to any financing conditions.
MNC holds secured debt and equity commitments more than sufficient to close the transaction and stands ready to provide those to Vista. MNC expects that the Vista Board will move forward expeditiously to sign a merger agreement on the terms proposed. MNC believes a definitive agreement can be executed in a matter of days.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Eric Nyman (CEO)', 1: 'Jason Vanderbrink (CEO)', 2: 'Andrew Keegan (DFI)', 3: 'Michael Callahan (CHM)', 4: 'Bob Steelhammer (CTO)', 5: 'Gary McArthur (BRD)', 6: 'Tyler Lindwall (IRC)', 7: 'Christine Roth (PRN)', 8: 'Jeffrey Ehrich (LAW)', 9: 'Brandon (Sparrow)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Chief Executive Officer', 2: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Investor Relations Contact', 7: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 8: 'General Counsel', 9: ''}, 'Age': {0: '52', 1: '47', 2: '40', 3: '74', 4: '-', 5: '64', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '46', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '23-08-20', 1: '04-12-31', 2: '-', 3: '14-08-12', 4: '18-09-30', 5: '15-01-27', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '23-02-15', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Gary McArthur (BRD)', 1: 'Lynn Utter (BRD)', 2: 'Robert Tarola (BRD)', 3: 'Michael Callahan (CHM)', 4: 'Eric Nyman (CEO)', 5: 'Jason Vanderbrink (CEO)', 6: 'Gerard Gibbons (BRD)', 7: 'Michael Robinson (BRD)', 8: 'Bruce Grooms (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Chief Executive Officer', 5: 'Chief Executive Officer', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '64', 1: '61', 2: '74', 3: '74', 4: '52', 5: '47', 6: '58', 7: '58', 8: '66'}, 'Since': {0: '15-01-27', 1: '20-05-31', 2: '15-02-08', 3: '14-08-12', 4: '23-08-20', 5: '04-12-31', 6: '22-07-25', 7: '18-12-16', 8: '22-07-25'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Bollé Brands (UK) Ltd.

The contract includes the construction of two 700 megawatts (MW) of electrical reactors at Kaigs in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, MEIL said on Wednesday, adding that it is the highest-valued tender ever rolled out by the state-run NPCIL.
Reuters reported in February that India will likely invite $26 billion in its nuclear energy sector to increase the amount of electricity generation from sources that do not produce carbon dioxide emissions.
NPCIL owns and operates the country's current fleet of nuclear power plants and its latest tender received bids from infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro and state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals, MEIL added.
""This contract represents the most significant project for MEIL and our strategic entry into the nuclear energy sector,"" said MEIL Director Ch Subbaiah.

No final decision has been made regarding the potential sale, Rovi said in a filing to the stock market regulator.
Investment funds Antin, Cinven, CVC, KKR and Permira have filed bids, newspaper Expansion reported earlier on Wednesday.
The five firms filed non-binding bids on June 13 and are now in the middle of a due diligence process for binding offers, the newspaper reported.
Spokespeople for Cinven and KKR declined to comment, while Antin, CVC and Permira did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Rovi said in March it had hired Lazard as an adviser for a potential sale of a business which has produced COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of Moderna, among other drugs.
It is estimated to be worth about 3.5 billion euros ($3.75 billion), Expansion said.
($1 = 0.9344 euros)

81,Haleon to Sell Nicotine-Quitting Aid Business for $634 Million,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/HALEON-PLC-139248469/news/Haleon-to-Sell-Nicotine-Quitting-Aid-Business-for-634-Million-47247676/,HLN,Jun. 26,Dow Jones,"By David Sachs
Haleon will sell a significant portion of its nicotine-quitting aid business to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, an India-based pharmaceutical company, in a 500 million-pound ($634.2 million) deal.
This move, which is limited to its business outside the U.S., will streamline Haleon's portfolio, but will affect the London- and New York-listed healthcare company's revenue and profitability this year. The sale will dilute revenue by 0.5% and operating profit by 1%, Haleon said.
The sale includes nicotine replacement therapies such as patches, lozenges, and gum under brands like Nicotinell, Nicabate, Habitrol, and Thrive.

U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital had aimed for a A$1 billion ($665.5 million) listing of Virgin on the Australian Securities Exchange but the plan was delayed, Reuters reported last year.
Government-owned Qatar Airways could announce its plans regarding the stake buy as early as next week, the AFR reported.
Bain Capital and Qatar Airways declined to comment.
Qatar Airways has shared a tumultuous relationship with Australia in the recent past after its attempt to increase its air presence in Australia was blocked by the Labor government.

84,Haleon sells NRT business outside of US for GBP500 million,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/HALEON-PLC-139248469/news/Haleon-sells-NRT-business-outside-of-US-for-GBP500-million-47247428/,HLN,Jun. 26,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Haleon PLC on Wednesday said it has agreed to sell its nicotine replacement therapy business outside of the US to Dr Reddy's Laboratories SA.
Haleon is a Surrey, England-based consumer healthcare arm, spun out of GSK PLC. Dr Reddy's Laboratories SA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dr Reddy's Laboratories LTD.
""Haleon's NRT business outside of the US is a leader in its category, with a strong portfolio of international and local brands including Nicotinell, Nicabate, Habitrol and Thrive.
""With a long standing heritage, the brands have built a strong reputation for delivering consumers with a variety of nicotine replacement solutions and supporting public health internationally,"" the company noted.
Haleon will be selling the unit to Dr Reddy's for GBP500 million. This is structured as an upfront cash payment of GBP458 million, with a further up to GBP42 million deferred performance-based consideration payable during 2025 and the first half of 2026.
""This divestment will allow Haleon to exit the NRT category outside of the US and will reduce complexity across the business allowing increased focus on strategic growth areas,"" Haleon said.
In 2023, the NRT business generated GBP217 million in revenue.
Assuming completion of the transaction in early in the final quarter of the year, Haleon said the sale is expected to dilute 2024 net revenue and adjusted operating profit by about 0.5% and 1% respectively.
Haleon Chief Executive Officer Brian McNamara commented: ""The divestment of Haleon's NRT business outside of the US is a further example of Haleon being proactive in managing its portfolio and is consistent with our strategy as we implement change to become more agile and competitive.
""Whilst this business has great brands, these are not core for us, but I'm sure they will continue to flourish given the focus and capability of Dr Reddy's.""
Haleon shares were down marginally at 332.36 pence in London on Tuesday afternoon.

86,VW joins forces with US rival Rivian on vehicle software,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VOLKSWAGEN-AG-436737/news/VW-joins-forces-with-US-rival-Rivian-on-vehicle-software-47219460/,VOW3,Jun. 26,Reuters,"Volkswagen is joining forces with US electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian to develop the next generation of car software and plans to invest up to five billion dollars in the project.
The Wolfsburg-based carmaker and Rivian intend to establish a joint venture for this purpose, which will be owned equally by both companies. ""The partnership is intended to accelerate the software development of the Volkswagen Group and Rivian,"" said a statement from both companies on Tuesday evening. Rivian's technology will form the basis for the software of future electric car models. ""This will be used in the vehicles of both companies"", which are to be launched on the market before 2030, VW explained.
Volkswagen has bundled its software development in its subsidiary Cariad, which has repeatedly struggled with problems. Because important software was not ready in time, the subsidiaries Audi and Porsche even had to postpone the launch of new models. According to ""Handelsblatt"", model launches at Audi have been behind schedule for two years. ""Through our collaboration, we will bring the best solutions to our vehicles faster and at lower costs,"" said Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume. ""The partnership fits seamlessly into our existing software strategy (...). It will strengthen our technology profile and our competitiveness.""
The Wolfsburg-based car manufacturer is investing up to three billion euros in Rivian. Founded in 2009, the company is worth around eleven billion dollars on the Nasdaq technology exchange, but is making billions in losses with its electric pickups and off-road vehicles. Rivian shares shot up by 42 percent in after-hours trading - equivalent to around four billion dollars.
As a first step, VW is subscribing to a convertible bond for one billion dollars, which is to be exchanged for Rivian shares in December at the earliest. Volkswagen plans to invest a further one billion dollars in Rivian shares in 2025 and 2026. Volkswagen will spend up to two billion dollars on the joint venture itself, part of which will be due for the licensing of the Rivian software when it is established, which is planned for the end of 2024.
Both companies could benefit from the partnership: Rivian needs fresh money to finance the development of the cheaper and smaller R2 SUV, which is due to be launched in 2026, CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters. According to Handelsblatt, the company is looking for new partners in view of the losses. The retail giant Amazon, with which Rivian works closely, does not want to inject any fresh money. Rivian had recently cut back production in order to save money.

87,"Bosch weighs offer for appliance maker Whirlpool, sources say",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/WHIRLPOOL-CORPORATION-14872/news/Bosch-weighs-offer-for-appliance-maker-Whirlpool-sources-say-47246516/,WHR,Jun. 26,Reuters,"June 26 (Reuters) - German engineering group Robert
Bosch is weighing a bid for U.S. appliances manufacturer
Whirlpool, according to three people familiar with the
matter, a move that would boost its position in the household
appliances market.
Bosch has been talking to potential advisers about the
possibility of making an offer for Whirlpool, which has a market
capitalisation of about $4.8 billion, one of the sources said.
The sources said it was not certain that an offer would be
made, and asked not to be identified because the matter is
confidential.
A Bosch spokesperson said the company does not comment on
""market rumours"", while officials at Whirlpool were not
immediately available for comment.
Buying one of the world's biggest white-goods manufacturers
would significantly beef up Bosch's home appliance business at a
time when competition with Asian rivals is growing.
Whirlpool has been undergoing a major restructuring in
recent years, which has seen it fold its European business into
a new company controlled by Turkish rival Arcelik and
divest its Middle Eastern and African businesses.
The potential takeover comes as Bosch, the world's biggest
automotive supplier, is looking at acquisitions to grow its unit
that manufactures large home appliances.
A deal for Whirlpool, whose brands include Ariston,
Hotpoint, Ignis and Privileg, would rank amongst the biggest
disclosed deals for the German industrial group.
Reuters reported in March that Bosch was among the
industrial firms competing to acquire heating and ventilation
assets worth over $6 billion from Johnson Controls International
in the U.S.
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung told German business daily
Handelsblatt in May that the company was looking at a few bigger
acquisition targets, and that it did not rule out entering a new
business area or a global deal.
He told reporters earlier in June that the group was open to
listing some of its divisions on the stock market as it explores
financing options for deals. He did not say which divisions.
Whirlpool, a household name known for its large appliances
such as washing machines and refrigerators, has in recent years
been aiming to grow its customer base by expanding in smaller
appliances such as espresso machines and other kitchen gadgets
as it grapples with a slowdown in growth.
The Michigan-based company recently said it would cut about
1,000 jobs in an effort to boost profit margins.
Whirlpool has lost almost 50% of its market value over the
past two years. Its Swedish rival Electrolux is down
35% in the same period.
Electrolux shares rose following the report, and were
trading up about 4.5% at 1040 GMT.

90,Blackstone snaps up UK hotel operator Village Hotels,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKSTONE-INC-60951400/news/Blackstone-snaps-up-UK-hotel-operator-Village-Hotels-47246209/,BX,Jun. 26,Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) -     Private equity giant Blackstone has agreed to buy British hotel operator Village Hotels, the company said on Wednesday, part of a wider investor push into the hospitality sector as it outperforms the broader commercial property market.
Blackstone said in a statement that funds managed by the firm had completed an acquisition of the hotel operator, which runs 33 mid-market hotels across regional cities and suburbs in Britain.
""We see great potential in lodging and leisure as a sector,"" said James Seppala, Head of Real Estate Europe at Blackstone.
The company did not disclose the value of the deal. Sky News has previously reported that the chain was put up for sale with a valuation of around 850 million pounds ($1.1 billion).
Blackstone's previous forays into the UK leisure sector have included the 2021 acquisition of holiday park-owner Bourne Leisure, which also runs hotel chain Warner Hotels.
Village Hotels was previously owned by investor KSL Capital Partners. Lazard and Santander advised Blackstone, while Morgan Stanley advised KSL.
($1 = 0.7895 pounds)

92,Analysis-A mountain of asset sales loom after oil megamerger era,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CHEVRON-CORPORATION-12064/news/Analysis-A-mountain-of-asset-sales-loom-after-oil-megamerger-era-47245973/,CVX,Jun. 26,Reuters,"(Reuters) -     U.S. oil and gas companies could face an uphill struggle to sell about $27 billion of assets to fund investor payouts over the next few years as the biggest wave of energy megamergers in 25 years nears the end of regulatory reviews.
The share buybacks and dividends are needed to lure investors back to an industry that many have shunned over volatile returns and pressure to decarbonize portfolios. Energy stocks represent just 4.1% by weight of the S&P 500, a third of their 2011 share as tech and health care investments took off.
But finding new owners for these properties is unlikely to be quick or easy, bankers and analysts warn. There are fewer institutional and European oil buyers interested, and a lack of ready cash to finance these deals. The private equity firms that once bought Big Oil's cast-offs have turned to energy transition, social impact and renewable investments.
The scale of mergers has been unprecedented with $180 billion from six deals since October. Driven by a rush to add oil reserves that can be tapped in the future, most of these deals are expected to wrap up this year and will unleash a burst of oil wells, pipelines, offshore fields and infrastructure packages onto the market. The lack of ready buyers suggests sales will take time and may turn into asset swaps, rather than cash sales.
Three acquirers - Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum - have pledged to raise between $16 billion and $23 billion combined from post-closing sales. Exxon Mobil, the top dealmaker, has not disclosed a divestiture target. But it has raised $4 billion per year in sale proceeds since 2021.
In addition to fewer private-equity and international buyers, more intensive regulatory reviews have slowed the marketing kickoff. Some investment bankers believe the divestitures could run well into next year.
HITTING THE MARKET
Exxon, which purchased Pioneer Natural Resources for $60 billion in May, wants to sell a collection of conventional oil and gas properties across the Permian Basin, to focus on higher growth assets, a spokesperson confirmed.
Conoco is primed to sell Western Oklahoma gas properties picked up in its $22.5 billion deal for Marathon Oil, and Chevron likely will place some of Hess' Asia offshore assets alongside its Canadian and U.S. gas packages now on the block, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity because regulatory reviews are underway.
Occidental has readied a sale of West Texas shale assets that could fetch $1 billion, and could add offshore Gulf of Mexico and Middle East assets once its CrownRock acquisition closes, say analysts.
Exxon confirmed it is exploring a sale of select conventional oil assets in West Texas and New Mexico ""consistent with our strategy to continually evaluate our portfolio."" It has not set a new asset sale target since the Pioneer deal.
Conoco and Occidental declined to comment on their asset sales targets.
A Chevron spokesperson said after the Hess closing ""we're going to add some assets that are going to be highly attractive"" to other companies. It could generate $10 billion to $15 billion in pre-tax proceeds through 2028.
HURDLES REMAIN
""These are not the best assets in the industry,"" said Luis Rhi, a portfolio manager at asset management firm Barrow Hanley Global Investors, who believes the companies can afford to sit pat until the market for assets improves.
""There is a real disconnect between the assets available and the dollars raised to buy those assets,"" David Krieger, co-managing partner at Houston energy investment firm Covalence Investment Partners. ""Dry powder for oil and gas investing is a fraction of what it used to be,"" he said.
Europe's oil majors, burned by past forays into U.S. shale, are not apt to return, said Brian Williams, managing director at investment bank Carl Marks Advisors. They ""have completed their education"" and have largely exited U.S. shale, he said.
Smaller private-equity backed firms lack the capital for these deals, say energy advisers. In 2023, just 78% of announced oil deals were below $1 billion in cost, compared to 94% in 2019, according to M&A advisory firm Petrie Partners.
""There are not a lot of sub-$1 billion acquisitions happening,"" said Todd Dittmann, who has invested in energy for several decades, mostly recently for Angelo Gordon & Co.
""There is an exit problem in energy private equity and partners are not happy about it,"" he said.
WHO'S LEFT?
Closely-held oil companies including Hilcorp, which specializes in buying mature fields, smaller publicly traded oil producers, and Asian and Middle East investors are best positioned. Japanese companies recently have shown more interest in U.S. natural gas, say bankers.
Hilcorp, founded by billionaire Jeffery Hildebrand, ""is chomping at the bit"" to get a look at Big Oil's cast-offs, said a person familiar with the company.
Elsewhere, ""We continue to see interest from parts of the globe outside Europe -- Asia, Middle East and other areas -- where there is appetite to be involved and deploy capital,"" said Bruce On, a partner in Ernst & Young's strategy and transactions group.
Many properties in the top U.S. shale field will be traded away or kept for their cash flow, said Andrew Dittmar, director of M&A at energy analytics firm Enverus.
""There is going to be a lot of ammunition for swaps and trades"" in West Texas  and New Mexico, he said.

93,Cooperation with Rivian does not help VW - criticism also about costs,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VOLKSWAGEN-AG-436737/news/Cooperation-with-Rivian-does-not-help-VW-criticism-also-about-costs-47245894/,VOW3,Jun. 26,dpa-AFX,"FRANKFURT/PARIS/NEW YORK (dpa-AFX) - The joy of Volkswagen shareholders over a cooperation with the US electric car manufacturer Rivian did not last long on Wednesday. Observers initially welcomed the news. But then increasingly critical assessments gained ground - also with regard to the high investments planned by the Wolfsburg-based company.
After moderate pre-market gains, the car manufacturer's shares got off to a weak start in Xetra trading. Towards midday, they were at the bottom of the Dax, losing 1.5 percent to 104.95 euros. They thus broke off the recent cautious recovery and returned to their lowest level since November at 103.80 euros. With an annual loss of around 6 percent, they continue to lag well behind the leading German index.
VW shares were also among the biggest losers in a European sector comparison in the middle of the week. The sector itself, with the sword of Damocles of the unresolved customs dispute between the EU and China still hanging over it, was at the bottom of the sector overview with a loss of 0.6 percent.
In contrast, Rivian's share price jumped by more than a third to 16.36 US dollars. In the year to date, Rivian shares have lost almost half their value. Despite the expected recovery, they are still a long way from their historic highs of almost 180 dollars.
VW intends to invest up to 5 billion US dollars in Rivian in the coming years. Initially, the company will acquire convertible bonds. After that, the Wolfsburg-based company wants to set up a joint venture with the Americans. The cooperation should make strategic sense in the long term if it is successful, commented one trader. Initially, however, the associated cash outflow would be a burden.
Another Borsian noted that VW had announced the partnership less than a year after concluding a similar cooperation with the Chinese electric car manufacturer Xpeng. This once again demonstrates VW's lack of in-house expertise in electronic components and software. VW appears to be placing its fate in the hands of two companies that are making losses.
The UBS analysts also referred to the generally mixed success stories of joint ventures in the industry. It remains to be seen how well the start-up culture of Rivian and the ""supertanker"" VW really fit together in the end.
But there were also voices of praise. Analyst Jose Asumendi from the US bank JPMorgan spoke of a step in the right direction, even if details of the planned cooperation with Rivian were still lacking. Citigroup expert Harald Hendrikse emphasized that the decisive factor was the confirmation that, thanks to the deal, VW would be able to access a functioning technology more cheaply than if it had developed it itself. The deal could immediately take VW several steps forward in the development of electrical and electronic architecture for vehicles, added Warburg analyst Fabio Holscher./gl/ajx/jha/","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Oliver Ingo Blume (CEO)', 1: 'Arno Antlitz (DFI)', 2: 'Hans Dieter Pötsch (CHM)', 3: 'Kurt Michels (CMP)', 4: 'Hauke Stars (CTO)', 5: 'Mario Hermann Daberkow (CTO)', 6: 'Thomas Schmall-von Westerholt (CTO)', 7: 'Daniela Cavallo (BRD)', 8: 'Rolf Woller (IRC)', 9: 'Heiner Lanze (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chairman', 3: 'Compliance Officer', 4: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 5: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 6: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Investor Relations Contact', 9: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '56', 1: '54', 2: '73', 3: '-', 4: '57', 5: '55', 6: '60', 7: '49', 8: '50', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '18-04-12', 1: '03-12-31', 2: '02-12-31', 3: '17-03-31', 4: '22-01-31', 5: '23-03-31', 6: '20-12-31', 7: '01-12-31', 8: '21-11-30', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Hans Dieter Pötsch (CHM)', 1: 'Wolfgang Porsche (BRD)', 2: 'Peter Mosch (BRD)', 3: 'Stephan Weil (BRD)', 4: 'Karina Schnur (BRD)', 5: 'Marianne Heiß (BRD)', 6: 'Günther Horvath (BRD)', 7: 'Daniela Cavallo (BRD)', 8: 'Harald Buck (BRD)', 9: 'Arno Homburg (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chairman', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Director/Board Member', 9: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '73', 1: '81', 2: '52', 3: '65', 4: '47', 5: '51', 6: '71', 7: '49', 8: '62', 9: '55'}, 'Since': {0: '02-12-31', 1: '08-04-23', 2: '06-01-17', 3: '13-02-18', 4: '23-07-10', 5: '18-02-13', 6: '23-02-27', 7: '01-12-31', 8: '22-10-03', 9: '22-05-11'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'SCANIA (AB)', 1: 'Ducati Motor Holding SpA Ducati Motor Holding SpAMotor VehiclesConsumer DurablesDucati Motor Holding SpA engages in the design and manufacture of motorcycles.

Under the pact, VW will invest $1 billion in Rivian and spend up to $5 billion as part of a software-development partnership. ""A partnership between Volkswagen and Rivian Automotive solves problems for both companies, giving much-needed liquidity to the U.S. electric-vehicle company and offering some help to the German giant with its software challenges,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said. The deal also gives VW exposure to the U.S. sport-utility-vehicle and pickup market, he added. Meanwhile, Berenberg analyst Romain Gourvil noted that the company's move shows an increasing push for partnerships over more cost-intensive insourcing. Dow Jones & Co. owns Factiva.

were up more than 2.5% Wednesday in the wake of a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing showing Exor
, the investment arm of Italy's Agnelli family, has
increased its stake in the Dutch healthcare technology group.
According to that Tuesday SEC filing, Exor now owns 17.51%
of Philips, up from 15.1%, strengthening its position as top
investor of the group.
Exor bought that 15.1% stake in Philips less than a year
ago, a move then seen as a vote confidence in the Dutch company,
which was at that time in the late stages of a huge product
recall that began in 2021.
A final deal on the sleep apnea machines was reached in the
U.S. two months ago.
At 0915 GMT, Philips shares gained 2.44% to 24.36 euros,
outperforming the Dutch AEX blue chip (+0.36%). Since the
start of the year, Philips is up almost 20% after gaining 57% in
2023 but losing 68% over the 2021-2022 period.

The transaction follows the completion of a strategic review of Opus's non-core SME energy supply business.
Opus was acquired by Drax in 2017 for GBP367 million, of which GBP159 million was goodwill, GBP224 million intangible assets and GBP16 million other net liabilities.
In 2023, following a reorganisation, goodwill of GBP145 million was reallocated between Opus and Drax Energy Solutions and the remaining GBP14 million of goodwill was impaired.
Drax said over the past seven years, elements of the acquired business have been transferred to Drax Energy Solutions, the group's core Industrial & Commercial energy supply business.
Those transfers include the renewables business holding the group's power purchase agreements with renewable generators, and certain other customers.
Drax believes these measures further support its decarbonisation strategy and the development of its Energy Solutions business which is focused on I&C customers, renewable power and energy services.
The Energy Solutions business is unaffected by the sale of the Opus SME assets and there is no change to the group's Energy Solutions earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation expectations as a result of this process.
The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2024.
Shares in Drax fell 0.3% to 509.95 pence in London on Wednesday morning.

The latest proposal was made in early June after previously Hipgnosis accepted Blackstone's raised takeover offer worth USD 1.57 billion, abandoning its deal with US music company Concord. Blackstone earlier said that the latest increase in its offer was due to the lower-than-expected adviser fees being incurred by Hipgnosis in relation to the transaction.
The terms of the deal have also been revised in terms of its nature, which was changed from a takeover to a scheme of arrangement, meaning that it needs to be approved by at least 75% of Hipgnosis shareholders.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Christopher Arthur Helm (DFI)', 1: 'David Rudolph (CMP)', 2: 'Shiv Prakash (CIO)', 3: 'Rufina Pavry (IRC)', 4: 'Patrick Thornton (AUD)', 5: 'Rosa Mercuriadis (PRN)', 6: 'Kenny MacPherson (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 1: 'Compliance Officer', 2: 'Chief Investment Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '19-12-31', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Christopher Mills (BRD)', 1: 'Robert Naylor (CHM)', 2: 'Simon Holden (BRD)', 3: 'Francis Keeling (BRD)', 4: 'Cindy Rampersaud (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Chairman', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '72', 1: '50', 2: '48', 3: '51', 4: '58'}, 'Since': {0: 'Dec. 14', 1: 'Nov. 06', 2: '17-12-31', 3: 'Nov. 05', 4: '23-07-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Hipgnosis Holdings UK (Ltd.)'}, 'Category and Sector': {0: ''}}}","{'Managers': {0: 'Christopher Arthur Helm (DFI)', 1: 'David Rudolph (CMP)', 2: 'Shiv Prakash (CIO)', 3: 'Rufina Pavry (IRC)', 4: 'Patrick Thornton (AUD)', 5: 'Rosa Mercuriadis (PRN)', 6: 'Kenny MacPherson (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 1: 'Compliance Officer', 2: 'Chief Investment Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '19-12-31', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-'}}","{'Members of the board': {0: 'Christopher Mills (BRD)', 1: 'Robert Naylor (CHM)', 2: 'Simon Holden (BRD)', 3: 'Francis Keeling (BRD)', 4: 'Cindy Rampersaud (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Chairman', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '72', 1: '50', 2: '48', 3: '51', 4: '58'}, 'Since': {0: 'Dec. 14', 1: 'Nov. 06', 2: '17-12-31', 3: 'Nov. 05', 4: '23-07-31'}}","{'Name': {0: 'Hipgnosis Holdings UK (Ltd.)'}, 'Category and Sector': {0: ''}}",2024-06-26 00:00:00
101,MNC Capital Increases All-Cash Offer to Acquire Vista Outdoor to $42 Per Share,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISTA-OUTDOOR-INC-20798585/news/MNC-Capital-Increases-All-Cash-Offer-to-Acquire-Vista-Outdoor-to-42-Per-Share-47251143/,VSTO,Jun. 26,S&P Capital IQ,"MNC Capital Partners, L.P. announced it has increased its all-cash offer to acquire Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:VSTO) to $42.00 per share, or approximately $3.2 billion. The revised proposal represents a premium of 55% to the VWAP from when Vista?s transaction with the Czechoslovak Group a.s. (?CSG?) was announced on October 16, 2023 to the last closing price before MNC?s initial offer on February 19, 2024. The revised offer is also an over 40% premium to the last closing price prior to MNC?s initial offer.
When MNC made its initial bid in mid-February, Vista?s shares were trading below $30 - at that time, the market reflected the acquisition of Kinetic by CSG. On June 25, 2024, Vista shares closed at $33.78 - the shares would have closed significantly lower without the expectation that MNC would be continuing to pursue the acquisition of Vista. MNC?s revised proposal represents a premium of almost 25% to June 25, 2024?s closing price.
Given MNC?s belief that its acquisition of Vista is in the best interests of shareholders, employees and national security, MNC decided to make one final effort for such acquisition by increasing its June 6, 2024 proposal from $39.50 per share all cash to $42.00 per share all cash. MNC said that it cannot see any possible basis or reason to further raise it. MNC?s revised proposal is all cash, has no regulatory issues and is not subject to any financing conditions.
MNC holds secured debt and equity commitments more than sufficient to close the transaction and stands ready to provide those to Vista. MNC expects that the Vista Board will move forward expeditiously to sign a merger agreement on the terms proposed. MNC believes a definitive agreement can be executed in a matter of days.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Eric Nyman (CEO)', 1: 'Jason Vanderbrink (CEO)', 2: 'Andrew Keegan (DFI)', 3: 'Michael Callahan (CHM)', 4: 'Bob Steelhammer (CTO)', 5: 'Gary McArthur (BRD)', 6: 'Tyler Lindwall (IRC)', 7: 'Christine Roth (PRN)', 8: 'Jeffrey Ehrich (LAW)', 9: 'Brandon (Sparrow)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Chief Executive Officer', 2: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Investor Relations Contact', 7: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 8: 'General Counsel', 9: ''}, 'Age': {0: '52', 1: '47', 2: '40', 3: '74', 4: '-', 5: '64', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '46', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '23-08-20', 1: '04-12-31', 2: '-', 3: '14-08-12', 4: '18-09-30', 5: '15-01-27', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '23-02-15', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Gary McArthur (BRD)', 1: 'Lynn Utter (BRD)', 2: 'Robert Tarola (BRD)', 3: 'Michael Callahan (CHM)', 4: 'Eric Nyman (CEO)', 5: 'Jason Vanderbrink (CEO)', 6: 'Gerard Gibbons (BRD)', 7: 'Michael Robinson (BRD)', 8: 'Bruce Grooms (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Chief Executive Officer', 5: 'Chief Executive Officer', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '64', 1: '61', 2: '74', 3: '74', 4: '52', 5: '47', 6: '58', 7: '58', 8: '66'}, 'Since': {0: '15-01-27', 1: '20-05-31', 2: '15-02-08', 3: '14-08-12', 4: '23-08-20', 5: '04-12-31', 6: '22-07-25', 7: '18-12-16', 8: '22-07-25'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Bollé Brands (UK) Ltd.

(NasdaqGS:DASH). The takeaway delivery giant saw shares jump as much as 7% in morning trading on June 26, 2024 amid speculation that the group was in the sights of the San Francisco-based competitor. Deliveroo was reportedly approached by DoorDash last month over a possible acquisition, but the discussions are said to have ended after the pair were unable to agree on value.
It comes after rumours also swirled in 2022 that DoorDash was mulling a takeover of Deliveroo. Deliveroo and DoorDash were approached for comment. Analysts at Jefferies said this ?may only be the start?
and could open the door to more takeover interest in Deliveroo. They said: ?In this instance, the talks have failed. ?But such is the strength of the financial, industrial and strategic logic of a Deliveroo takeover, we would not be surprised to see similar such headlines to re-emerge in the short term.
?In our view, the key to unlocking a recommended offer from Deliveroo is understanding the sensibilities of the founder CEO, Will Shu. ?This may only be the start?.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'William Shu (FOU)', 1: 'Scilla Grimble (DFI)', 2: 'Eric French (COO)', 3: 'Dan Winn (CTO)', 4: 'Tim (Warrington)', 5: 'Carlo Mocci (PRN)', 6: 'Chantelle Zemba (LAW)', 7: 'Catherine Sukmonowski (SEC)', 8: 'Adam Bishop (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Founder', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Operating Officer', 3: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 4: '', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'General Counsel', 7: 'Corporate Secretary', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '45', 1: '51', 2: '48', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '13-01-31', 1: '23-02-19', 2: '20-12-31', 3: '18-09-30', 4: '-', 5: '20-08-31', 6: '16-12-31', 7: '-', 8: '21-06-30'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Dominique Reiniche (BRD)', 1: 'Karen Jones (BRD)', 2: 'Rick Medlock (BRD)', 3: 'Claudia Arney (CHM)', 4: 'Jeremy Jackson (BRD)', 5: 'William Shu (FOU)', 6: 'Scilla Grimble (DFI)', 7: 'Tom Stafford (BRD)', 8: 'Shobie Ramakrishnan (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Founder', 6: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '68', 1: '67', 2: '64', 3: '53', 4: '49', 5: '45', 6: '51', 7: '43', 8: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '21-04-30', 1: '21-05-31', 2: '21-03-18', 3: '21-03-18', 4: '21-12-31', 5: '13-01-31', 6: '23-02-19', 7: '21-03-18', 8: 'Dec. 31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Amazon (Venture Capital) (13.23%)', 1: 'DST Global (Mgmt) (7.543%)', 2: 'William Shu (6.465%)', 3: 'T.

105,AI stocks to leave big impact on Russell reconstitution,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/NVIDIA-CORPORATION-57355629/news/AI-stocks-to-leave-big-impact-on-Russell-reconstitution-47133066/,NVDA,Jun. 25,Reuters,"NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Investors are gearing up
for the final reconstitution of the benchmark indexes by FTSE
Russell on Friday, with the furious rally in artificial
intelligence (AI) related stocks over the past year expected to
leave an outsized imprint on their final shape.
The Russell Reconstitution, an event that typically results
in one of the busiest trading days of the year, will become
official after the closing bell on Friday and concludes a
multi-step process by FTSE Russell for the annual refresh of its
indexes.
This once-a-year change prompts fund managers to adjust
their portfolios to reflect the new weightings and components.
This refresh encompasses a range of the Russell indexes,
such as the Russell 1000 index of large-cap stocks and
the Russell 2000 index of small-cap names which together
make up the Russell 3000 index. In addition, there are
style indexes such as the Russell 1000 growth and Russell
2000 value indexes.
Since last year's reconstitution, the furious rally in
stocks seen as likely to benefit from AI, names such as Nvidia
and Super Micro Computer, is expected to
significantly impact Russell's growth and value indexes this
year.
Even with a recent slide, Nvidia shares as of Monday have
rallied about 180% from a year ago, while Super Micro has gained
more than 230%. Meta Platforms has jumped nearly 75%
and Microsoft has climbed more than 31%.
The outperformance in growth means there will be fewer than
400 stocks in the Russell 1000 growth index, according to
Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis in New York, who
estimates the top five names will account for over 44% of the
weighting.
""All the top names keep getting a chunkier and chunkier
proportion,"" said DeSanctis.
In addition, the weightings in the Russell 2000 growth will
shift and DeSanctis anticipates a 4.6% decrease in tech's
weighting while health care will gain 3.4%.
The Russell 1000 growth index is expected to have about
two-thirds of its components in just technology and
communication services, said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior
portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee
Falls, Wisconsin.
Meanwhile, about 45 stocks are leaving the growth index,
reducing the index to just over 390 names, compared to roughly
870 in the counterpart value index, VanCronkhite said.
""It becomes much more challenging to beat benchmarks when
you have fewer tools in the toolbox,"" VanCronkhite said. ""If you
have a smaller number of names, you may have fewer options to
construct the ideal portfolio.""
While some index providers choose to constantly refresh
their indexes to keep a fixed amount of components in them, FTSE
Russell only reconstitutes once per year, with the exception of
adding initial public offerings on a quarterly basis.
Because the reconstitution is well telegraphed every year,
it also creates additional demand for buying and selling stocks
as some investors may see the additional liquidity as an
opportunity to take advantage of any price dislocations that may
result.
At the June 2023 reconstitution, $72.7 billion and $61.7
billion in U.S. stocks traded in the closing moments of Friday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq exchanges,
respectively, according to FTSE Russell.
Due to the concentration in the mega cap growth stocks such
as Nvidia this year, the typical large cap growth manager is
underweight by the top ten benchmark stocks by 16.7%, UBS senior
U.S. equity strategist Patrick Palfrey estimated in a report
late last month. Palfrey expects the top 10 company weights in
the Russell 1000 growth index to increase from 56.1% to 61.3%
after the refresh.
""In theory, the increase in concentration from the rebalance
would create buying pressure in these stocks, in practice, the
impact should be mitigated by portfolio diversification rules,""
the UBS analysts said in the report to clients, noting this
should increase tracking error among growth managers.
As of December 2023, approximately $10.5 trillion in assets
were benchmarked to the Russell U.S. indexes and $15.9 trillion
globally. While Russell has begun offering indexes that either
cap the weight of the largest market cap stocks or exclude them,
there are no plans to adjust the methodology of the indexes to
account for the market concentration.
""We're here as an index provider to reflect the market.
That's what we're hearing consistently from our clients that
they want,"" said Catherine Yoshimoto, Director of Product
Management for the Russell US Indexes at FTSE Russell.
""And for those who have other needs, we are figuring out
solutions that could work for them, like the capped indexes or
exclusion indexes or different segmentations of the market.""

109,Anglo American Reportedly Sets Up for AUD 7.5 Billion Coal Exit,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CORONADO-GLOBAL-RESOURCES-46749711/news/Anglo-American-Reportedly-Sets-Up-for-AUD-7-5-Billion-Coal-Exit-47030352/,CRN,Jun. 24,S&P Capital IQ,"Anglo American plc (LSE:AAL) is expected to appoint an investment bank any day for a sale of its $5 billion (AUD 7.5 billion) portfolio of Australian coalmining assets, according to sources in the market. The sale, which comes after an announced company break-up while it has been fending off advances from BHP, will involve big dollars for what are some of the best metallurgical coal mines in the world. That may limit the field somewhat.
One of the parties most strongly positioned for the portfolio is BHP itself, but perhaps it does not want to be seen to be reinforcing Anglo American's break-up strategy that enhances Anglo's value. But sources say BHP will not be in contention for the mines. If the break-up of Anglo American does not go well, it's always been considered a possibility that BHP comes back a second time with an ""all of company"" bid for Anglo American after several months.
The bet by some is that the coal auction attracts non-conforming offers. China-backed Yancoal Australia Ltd. (ASX:YAL) will probably bid for Anglo American's Capcoal and Dawson assets, while Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC), Coronado Global Resources Inc. (ASX:CRN) and Stanmore Resources Limited could bid for the other more attractive mines, Moranbah North and Grosvenor. Other assets that form part of the Queensland portfolio are the Aquila project, an interest in Jellinbah and the potential Moranbah South project, producing about 16 million tonnes a year.
Glencore would also be large enough to buy the mines, but the Swiss trader is yet to complete its acquisition of Teck Resources, so could be distracted with that. Other than that, it's hard to see what other groups would be well placed to buy the entire portfolio, with Whitehaven Coal busy digesting the coal mines it has only just bought from BHP. There's been a view that perhaps the reason why BHP sold its Daunia and Blackwater coal mines in the first place was to make way for the Anglo American assets it would inherit as part of its planned buyout, clearing any challenges it may face owning both from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission.
In terms of selecting an investment bank, Anglo American has used Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as its defence advisers so both could be well-placed.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Garold Spindler (FOU)', 1: 'Douglas Thompson (CEO)', 2: 'Gerhard Ziems (DFI)', 3: 'Jeffrey Bitzer (COO)', 4: 'Andrew Mooney (IRC)', 5: 'Emma Pollard (HRO)', 6: 'Susan Casey (SEC)', 7: 'Christopher Meyering (LAW)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Founder', 1: 'Chief Executive Officer', 2: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 3: 'Chief Operating Officer', 4: 'Investor Relations Contact', 5: 'Human Resources Officer', 6: 'Corporate Secretary', 7: 'General Counsel'}, 'Age': {0: '76', 1: '51', 2: '54', 3: '68', 4: '-', 5: '51', 6: '57', 7: '65'}, 'Since': {0: '10-12-31', 1: '21-08-04', 2: '20-07-12', 3: '12-12-31', 4: '19-01-31', 5: '17-12-31', 6: '21-03-31', 7: '21-08-31'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Garold Spindler (FOU)', 1: 'Gregory Pritchard (BRD)', 2: 'Laura L.

110,Boeing Reportedly Nears Deal to Buy Spirit AeroSystems,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SPIRIT-AEROSYSTEMS-HOLDIN-37142/news/Boeing-Reportedly-Nears-Deal-to-Buy-Spirit-AeroSystems-47251995/,SPR,Jun. 23,S&P Capital IQ,"The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has offered to acquire Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) for about $35 a share in a deal funded mostly with stock, according to people familiar with the matter. The latest proposal represents a switch from Boeing?s plan to fund an all-cash offer after months of talks between the companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential matter. A $35 per share price would represent a premium of about 6% to Spirit?s stock as of Monday?s close, suggesting an equity valuation of $4.1 billion.
It?s also a 22% upside to its closing price on February 29, the day before Boeing?s takeover talks became public. A Boeing representative declined to comment on the decision to move to an all-stock deal, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. ?We continue to focus on the providing the best quality products for our customers,?
said Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit. The change in currency for the outlay should ease some of the squeeze on the cash-strapped planemaker, the people said. Final terms are still being hammered out and could include a small amount of cash, they said.
?We await more details, but we see the $35/share mark as a reasonable outcome for both parties,? Stifel analyst Bert W. Subin said in a note to clients. Boeing?s decision to revise the payment terms is the latest twist in an unusually complex transaction, which will also require Spirit to spin off some of its manufacturing plants to Airbus SE (ENXTPA:AIR).
The switch will require more due diligence, but isn?t seen as a deal-killer. The three-way transaction is still expected to be announced within a matter of days, said the people. Shares of Spirit slid 4% to $31.75 in premarket US trading on June 25, 2024.
They had gained 4.1% year-to-date on anticipation of a sale, despite financial distress that has required financial aid from its two biggest customers.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Patrick Shanahan (CEO)', 1: 'Irene Esteves (DFI)', 2: 'Sean Black (CTO)', 3: 'Justin Welner (ADM)', 4: 'Terry George (COO)', 5: 'Ryan Avey (IRC)', 6: 'Damon Ward (AUD)', 7: 'Mark Miklos (PRN)', 8: 'Kailash Krishnaswamy (PRN)', 9: 'Mindy McPheeters (LAW)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 3: 'Chief Administrative Officer', 4: 'Chief Operating Officer', 5: 'Investor Relations Contact', 6: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 7: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 9: 'General Counsel'}, 'Age': {0: '61', 1: '65', 2: '53', 3: '54', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '50', 7: '-', 8: '-', 9: '51'}, 'Since': {0: '21-11-11', 1: '15-05-07', 2: '15-12-31', 3: '11-12-31', 4: '20-01-31', 5: '-', 6: '08-12-31', 7: '19-12-31', 8: '17-02-28', 9: '14-12-31'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Irene Esteves (DFI)', 1: 'Laura Wright (BRD)', 2: 'Ronald Kadish (BRD)', 3: 'Robert Johnson (CHM)', 4: 'Paul Fulchino (BRD)', 5: 'John Plueger (BRD)', 6: 'Patrick Shanahan (CEO)', 7: 'William Fitzgerald (BRD)', 8: 'Stephen Cambone (BRD)', 9: 'James Ray (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Chief Executive Officer', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Director/Board Member', 9: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '65', 1: '64', 2: '75', 3: '76', 4: '77', 5: '69', 6: '61', 7: '63', 8: '71', 9: '60'}, 'Since': {0: '15-05-07', 1: '18-02-21', 2: '06-11-14', 3: '06-11-14', 4: '06-11-14', 5: '14-07-28', 6: '21-11-11', 7: '21-11-11', 8: '19-10-21', 9: '22-02-13'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Fidelity Management & Research Co.

(ENXTAM:ABN) is nearing deal to buy HSBC Holdings plc (LSE:HSBA),s German private bank as per reports. The takeover of the business, formerly known as HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt GmbH, could be announced over the next two to three weeks, the paper said. A transaction would extend ABN Amro's foray into Germany, Europe's largest wealth management market, after it last month signed a deal to buy Fosun's private bank Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe for EUR 672 million ($730 million).
The addition of HSBC's German private bank would boost ABN Amro's assets under management by EUR 26 billion from about EUR 70 billion, Boersenzeitung reported.

The Second Proposal follows a previously rejected proposal from Carlsberg (the ""First Proposal"") received on 06 June 2024 at an offer price of 1,200 pence per Britvic share.
The Board together with its advisers carefully considered the Second Proposal, and concluded that it significantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected the Second Proposal on 17 June 2024. The Board remains confident in the current and future prospects of Britvic.
It recognises its fiduciary duties and will consider any further proposal on its merits. There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made for the Company, nor as to the terms of any such offer, should one be made. Any offer for Britvic is governed by the Code.
Under Rule 2.6(a) of the Code,Carlsberg must, by not later than 5.00 p.m. on 19 July 2024, either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Britvic in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. This deadline can be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code.

118,Scentre Joins Investment Bank for Stake in Tea Tree Plaza,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SCENTRE-GROUP-16764232/news/Scentre-Joins-Investment-Bank-for-Stake-in-Tea-Tree-Plaza-47022620/,SCG,Jun. 21,S&P Capital IQ,"The owner of the local Westfield empire, Scentre Group (ASX:SCG), has teamed up with investment bank Barrenjoey to buy a half stake in Adelaide's Westfield Tea Tree Plaza and a small adjoining centre for about $308 million. The deal marks a shift by the large mall owner, which has traditionally worked with big institutions to buy malls. By joining with the bank it is now tapping private capital that wants to directly own shopping centres, opening up a new pool of investors.
The transaction also shows that large institutions that own malls are seeing value in them, following a fall in values triggered by higher interest rates and Covid-19. Scentre and Barrenjoey made their move on the stake in the mall in April by launching an unlisted trust to own a half interest in the property, Adelaide's second largest mall. Their surprise move effectively thwarted a transaction that would have resulted in acquisitive funds house IP Generation purchasing the stake in the mall from the Dexus-managed fund selling it.
The move not only signals Scentre's entry into funds but this is expected to continue as more centres come up given the offer was oversubscribed. The deal also shows the large pricing recalibration of regional shopping centre assets since the boom times before the pandemic. Scentre Group Chief Executive Elliott Rusanow said the group had successfully partnered with Barrenjoey Private Capital to establish a fund to purchase a 50% share in Westfield Tea Tree Plaza and the adjoining Tea Tree Plus.
""The opportunity was oversubscribed, reflecting the strong demand from private investors to invest directly into one of our Westfield destinations,"" he said. ""The group has retained its 50% interest and will continue to drive the strong operating performance of the centre."" A Dexus spokesman confirmed the sale of the centre as part of the fund's proactive capital management strategy. The unlisted vehicle has been selling down assets to meet redemptions.
CBRE agent Simon Rooney negotiated the deal for the Dexus-managed fund as institutional and private capital flows back into the regional shopping centre market. The acquisition comes just weeks after the announcement of Vicinity Centre's agreement with the Future Fund to acquire its 50% interest in Lakeside Joondalup, Western Australia, with additional major retail transactions expected to be completed in coming months.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Elliott Rusanow (CEO)', 1: 'Andrew Clarke (DFI)', 2: 'Aidan Coleman (CTO)', 3: 'Maureen McGrath (CMP)', 4: 'Matthew Gulczynski (IRC)', 5: 'Stewart White (PRN)', 6: 'Maria Stamoulis (HRO)', 7: 'Talbot Sanderson (AUD)', 8: 'John Pappagianis (PRN)', 9: 'Richard Williams (TRE)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 3: 'Compliance Officer', 4: 'Investor Relations Contact', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'Human Resources Officer', 7: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 9: 'Treasurer'}, 'Age': {0: '50', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '-', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '19-04-03', 1: '14-06-29', 2: '18-12-31', 3: '14-06-29', 4: '21-08-31', 5: '-', 6: '12-01-31', 7: '16-03-31', 8: '14-06-29', 9: '14-06-29'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Sarah Kay (BRD)', 1: 'Michael Ihlein (BRD)', 2: 'Mike Wilkins Wilkins (BRD)', 3: 'Catherine Brenner (BRD)', 4: 'Ilana Atlas (CHM)', 5: 'Elliott Rusanow (CEO)', 6: 'Gaetano Russo (BRD)', 7: 'Margie Seale (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Chairman', 5: 'Chief Executive Officer', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '63', 1: '69', 2: '67', 3: '53', 4: '69', 5: '50', 6: '65', 7: '63'}, 'Since': {0: '16-02-23', 1: '14-06-29', 2: '20-04-07', 3: '22-02-28', 4: '21-05-27', 5: '19-04-03', 6: '20-08-31', 7: '16-02-23'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Scentre Management Ltd.

Sky News understands that CVC, which floated in Amsterdam last month, is the final remaining bidder for M Group (M GROUP Services Limited). CVC is said to have seen off competition from rival bidders including Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO), with a deal expected to be signed in the coming weeks.
The price that CVC, which owns assets including a stake in rugby union's Six Nations Championship, is paying for M Group was unclear on 21 June 2024, although previous reports about the auction pegged its value at about £1.5 billion. Since 2018, it has been majority-owned by PAI Partners, another private equity firm. Investment bankers at Citi are advising PAI on the sale process.
The prospective deal comes amid a flurry of deal making across the infrastructure sector. CVC declined to comment, while PAI could not be reached for comment.","{'Managers': None, 'Members of the board': None, 'Name': None}",,,,2024-06-20 00:00:00

122,Aurubis rallies - Vague takeover fantasies after 'MM' report,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/AURUBIS-AG-436439/news/Aurubis-rallies-Vague-takeover-fantasies-after-MM-report-47010785/,NDA,Jun. 20,dpa-AFX,"FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - Vague takeover fantasies boosted the shares of copper group Aurubis on Thursday afternoon. With a price gain of 6.25 percent to 77.35 euros, they were one of the favorites in the MDax, approaching their high for the year, which they had reached in May at 80.50 euros. For 2024, the share price is now back up by a good 4%.
A report in ""Manager Magazin"" entitled ""How major shareholder Salzgitter is expanding its power at Aurubis"" provided the share price with a tailwind on Thursday. The report discusses the search for a new Aurubis CEO, which is also proving difficult due to the ideas of Salzgitter CEO Gunnar Groebler. The steel producer holds just under 30 percent of the copper smelter and Groebler sits on Aurubis' Supervisory Board.
Groebler wanted a candidate with transformation experience in addition to other qualifications. According to the newspaper, this would give rise to suspicions at Aurubis that the Salzgitter boss wants to change the majority situation. Nevertheless, Salzgitter has repeated recent statements that it is not planning a takeover of Aurubis.
Last year, cases of fraud and theft weighed on Aurubis' business. The millions in losses also led to criticism of the Group's risk management. As a result, almost the entire Executive Board had to leave. Aurubis CEO Roland Harings, Chief Financial Officer Rainer Verhoeven and Chief Production Officer Heiko Arnold lost or resigned prematurely.
While Arnold already left Aurubis at the end of February, Harings is leaving on September 30. A successor has already been found for Verhoeven. Mercedes manager Steffen Hoffmann will take over the finance department when he joins the company on October 1./mis/ck/jha/","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Roland Harings (CEO)', 1: 'Rainer Verhoeven (DFI)', 2: 'Elke Lossin (BRD)', 3: 'Angela Seidler (IRC)', 4: 'Markus Kramer (PRN)', 5: 'Inge Hofkens (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '61', 1: '56', 2: '59', 3: '-', 4: '60', 5: '54'}, 'Since': {0: '19-05-19', 1: '17-12-31', 2: '98-12-31', 3: '-', 4: '23-02-15', 5: '22-12-31'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Stephan Krümmer (BRD)', 1: 'Fritz Vahrenholt (CHM)', 2: 'Kathrin Dahnke (BRD)', 3: 'Jan Koltze (BRD)', 4: 'Sandra Reich (BRD)', 5: 'Gunnar Groebler (BRD)', 6: 'Elke Lossin (BRD)', 7: 'Stefan Schmidt (BRD)', 8: 'Christian Ehrentraut (BRD)', 9: 'Daniel Mrosek (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Chairman', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Director/Board Member', 9: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '68', 1: '75', 2: '64', 3: '61', 4: '47', 5: '52', 6: '59', 7: '57', 8: '59', 9: '35'}, 'Since': {0: '18-02-28', 1: '99-11-25', 2: '23-02-15', 3: '87-12-31', 4: '13-02-27', 5: '21-09-30', 6: '98-12-31', 7: '18-02-28', 8: '92-12-31', 9: '23-02-15'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Aurubis Netherlands BV Aurubis Netherlands BVOther Metals/MineralsNon-Energy MineralsPart of Aurubis AG, Aurubis Netherlands BV is a manufacturer of copper and copper alloy products.

123,Takeover fantasy drives Evotec recovery,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EVOTEC-SE-436047/news/Takeover-fantasy-drives-Evotec-recovery-47007597/,EVT,Jun. 20,dpa-AFX,"FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX Broker) - Driven by takeover fantasies, Evotec shares rebounded from their 2017 low on Thursday morning. The shares of the drug discovery company gained up to 11 percent to 8.17 euros in the MDax after falling to 7.215 euros on Monday. They had thus lost two thirds of their value in 2024.
According to a report by the Bloomberg news agency, this slump in the share price has apparently caused the company to worry about possible takeover bids. The Hamburg-based company has consulted advisors in order to be prepared accordingly, according to sources close to the matter. Several hedge funds have Evotec on their radar, but no one has yet approached the company.
The takeover speculation is now causing problems for speculators who were betting on a further fall in the share price. If they close out their positions, this will create additional buying pressure./ag/tih","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Mario Polywka (CEO)', 1: 'Laetitia Rouxel (DFI)', 2: 'Craig Johnstone (COO)', 3: 'Cord Dohrmann (CTO)', 4: 'Gabriele Hansen (IRO)', 5: 'Volker Braun (IRC)', 6: 'Matthias Evers (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Operating Officer', 3: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 4: 'Public Communications Contact', 5: 'Investor Relations Contact', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '61', 1: '51', 2: '54', 3: '60', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '51'}, 'Since': {0: '19-06-18', 1: '23-02-06', 2: '12-04-30', 3: '10-08-31', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '22-04-30'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Mario Polywka (CEO)', 1: 'Roland Sackers (BRD)', 2: 'Iris Löw-Friedrich (CHM)', 3: 'Camilla Languille (BRD)', 4: 'Constanze Ulmer-Eilfort (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Chairman', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '61', 1: '56', 2: '63', 3: '41', 4: '62'}, 'Since': {0: '19-06-18', 1: '19-06-18', 2: '14-06-16', 3: '22-06-21', 4: '21-05-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Evotec (France) SAS Evotec (France) SASMiscellaneous Commercial ServicesCommercial ServicesPart of Evotec SE, Evotec (France) SAS is a French company that engages in research and development of physical and natural sciences.

DataRoom understands that investment banks have been invited to pitch in the past fortnight for a role selling what is one of the country's largest retirement operators. Among Aveo's lenders are believed to be Goldman Sachs and Macquarie Capital, so they may be well placed when it comes to landing a role.
Brookfield has been working to sell Aveo's Tasmanian, Adelaide and Western Australia assets in a quest to position the business as an eastern seaboard index-linked bond. The understanding is that the invitation to pitch has gone far and wide to multiple advisers. Their job is to tell Brookfield how they would sell the business and to whom it would be sold.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Tony Randello (CEO)', 1: 'Vij Sameer (DFI)', 2: 'Warren Haveman (CTO)', 3: 'Natalie Patterson (COO)', 4: 'Geoffrey Grady (BRD)', 5: 'Rolanda Mitchell (HRO)', 6: 'David Korman (LAW)', 7: 'Bridgid Allsopp (SAM)', 8: 'Natalie Moore (SAM)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 3: 'Chief Operating Officer', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Human Resources Officer', 6: 'General Counsel', 7: 'Sales & Marketing', 8: 'Sales & Marketing'}, 'Age': {0: '-', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '65', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '20-12-01', 1: '22-12-31', 2: '21-11-30', 3: '20-11-23', 4: '09-02-28', 5: '20-04-30', 6: '21-02-28', 7: '21-02-28', 8: '21-03-31'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'James Edward Forrest Frayne (BRD)', 1: 'Kee Wai Lo (BRD)', 2: 'Eng Leong Lee (BRD)', 3: 'Geoffrey Grady (BRD)', 4: 'Walter L.

128,Boyd Gaming Reportedly Approaches PENN Entertainment About Acquisition,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BOYD-GAMING-CORPORATION-11960/news/Boyd-Gaming-Reportedly-Approaches-PENN-Entertainment-About-Acquisition-47251999/,BYD,Jun. 19,S&P Capital IQ,"Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), has approached PENN Entertainment, Inc. (NasdaqGS:PENN), to express interest in acquiring its peer that has a market value of more than $9 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. Penn's shares jumped 8% on June 20 afternoon in New York to $19.89 after Reuters reported Boyd's approach. Boyd's stock fell 3% to $51.90.
It would be challenging since Boyd, the smaller company with a market value including debt of $7.8 billion, would need financial firepower to clinch a deal. The companies would also need the blessing of regulators and officials in several states where they both operate. Boyd would also need to win over Walt Disney (DIS.N), which through its sports network ESPN has a partnership with Penn.
The sources said there was no certainty Penn will engage in negotiations with Boyd. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Penn declined to comment.
Boyd and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Keith Smith (CEO)', 1: 'Bill Boyd (FOU)', 2: 'Josh Hirsberg (DFI)', 3: 'Marianne Johnson (CHM)', 4: 'Ted Bogich (COO)', 5: 'Steve Thompson (ADM)', 6: 'William Boyd (BRD)', 7: 'Lori Nelson (AUD)', 8: 'Uri Clinton (LAW)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Founder', 2: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Chief Operating Officer', 5: 'Chief Administrative Officer', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 8: 'General Counsel'}, 'Age': {0: '63', 1: '92', 2: '62', 3: '65', 4: '69', 5: '64', 6: '64', 7: '43', 8: '51'}, 'Since': {0: '90-08-31', 1: '74-12-31', 2: '07-12-31', 3: '76-12-31', 4: '03-12-31', 5: '82-12-31', 6: '90-11-30', 7: '21-12-31', 8: '21-02-28'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Bill Boyd (FOU)', 1: 'Paul Whetsell (BRD)', 2: 'Peter Thomas (BRD)', 3: 'Christine Spadafor (BRD)', 4: 'William Boyd (BRD)', 5: 'Marianne Johnson (CHM)', 6: 'Keith Smith (CEO)', 7: 'John Bailey (BRD)', 8: 'A.

129,Evotec Reportedly Said to Tap Advisers as Stock Drop Sparks Takeover Fears,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EVOTEC-SE-436047/news/Evotec-Reportedly-Said-to-Tap-Advisers-as-Stock-Drop-Sparks-Takeover-Fears-47246891/,EVT,Jun. 19,S&P Capital IQ,"Evotec SE (XTRA:EVT) is speaking to defense advisers after a decline in its share price prompted fears about the company?s vulnerability to a takeover, people with knowledge of the matter said. Multiple buyout firms have been studying Hamburg-based Evotec as a potential target, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Potential suitors are in the early stages of speaking to advisers as they evaluate Evotec and its drug pipeline, according to the people.
Shares of Evotec jumped as much as 11% in early trading in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of about ?1.4 billion ($1.5 billion). Before June 20, 2024, the stock had fallen 66% year-to-date, with the price hitting the lowest level since March 2017 earlier this week after analysts at Intron Health downgraded the stock to ?sell,? from ?buy.?
No approaches have been made and it?s likely to be at least several months before any formal interest materializes, the people said. The company announced in January that its chief executive officer at the time, Werner Lanthaler, would be stepping down early for personal reasons. Evotec later said Lanthaler had failed to report his stock trades on time, adding the lapse was unrelated to his exit.
Incoming chief executive Christian Wojczewski will take over next month and will likely assess the current situation before making any strategic decisions, the people said. Any major move would need support from Evotec?s biggest shareholders ? Novo Holdings A/S, the parent company of drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S, as well as Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Mubadala Investment Co.
Evotec has partnered with larger healthcare firms like Novo Nordisk, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Eli Lilly & Co. The company has been developing treatments targeting areas including chronic kidney disease and metabolic disorders.
Deliberations are ongoing and there?s no certainty any transaction will result, the people said. A representative for Evotec declined to comment.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Mario Polywka (CEO)', 1: 'Laetitia Rouxel (DFI)', 2: 'Craig Johnstone (COO)', 3: 'Cord Dohrmann (CTO)', 4: 'Gabriele Hansen (IRO)', 5: 'Volker Braun (IRC)', 6: 'Matthias Evers (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Operating Officer', 3: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 4: 'Public Communications Contact', 5: 'Investor Relations Contact', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '61', 1: '51', 2: '54', 3: '60', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '51'}, 'Since': {0: '19-06-18', 1: '23-02-06', 2: '12-04-30', 3: '10-08-31', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '22-04-30'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Mario Polywka (CEO)', 1: 'Roland Sackers (BRD)', 2: 'Iris Löw-Friedrich (CHM)', 3: 'Camilla Languille (BRD)', 4: 'Constanze Ulmer-Eilfort (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Chairman', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '61', 1: '56', 2: '63', 3: '41', 4: '62'}, 'Since': {0: '19-06-18', 1: '19-06-18', 2: '14-06-16', 3: '22-06-21', 4: '21-05-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Evotec (France) SAS Evotec (France) SASMiscellaneous Commercial ServicesCommercial ServicesPart of Evotec SE, Evotec (France) SAS is a French company that engages in research and development of physical and natural sciences.

The Board notes the recent press speculation and confirms that the Proposal is at 505 pence in cash for each Alpha FMC share. The Proposal represents an attractive premium of: 50.7% to the closing price of 335.0 pence per Alpha FMC share on 30 April 2024 (being the last business day before the date of the commencement of the offer period (as defined in the Code) relating to Alpha FMC (the ?Offer Period?)); and 47.4% to the volume-weighted average price of 342.7 pence per Alpha FMC share for the three-month period ended 30 April 2024 (being the last business day before the date of the commencement of the Offer Period); Having carefully considered the terms of the Proposal with its financial advisers, the Independent Directors of Alpha FMC have concluded that they would be minded unanimously to recommend the proposal to Alpha FMC shareholders should a firm intention to make an offer pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the Code be announced on such financial terms, subject to the finalisation of documentation and discussions, which are advanced.
In accordance with Rule 2.5(a) of the Code, Bridgepoint reserves the right to make an offer for Alpha FMC at a lower value or on less favourable terms than the Proposal: with the agreement or recommendation of the Board of Alpha FMC; if a third party announces a possible offer or a firm intention to make an offer for Alpha FMC which, at that date, is of a value less than the value of the Proposal; if Alpha FMC announces a Rule 9 waiver transaction pursuant to Appendix 1 of the Code or a reverse takeover (as defined in the Code); or if Alpha FMC announces, declares or pays any dividend or any other distribution or return of capital to shareholders, in which case Bridgepoint reserves the right to make an equivalent reduction to any offer. Bridgepoint reserves the right to introduce other forms of consideration and/or vary the mix or composition of consideration of any offer. There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made for Alpha FMC.

(the 'Board') confirmed that it has received a further non-binding proposal (the 'Revised Proposal') from a consortium comprising CVC Advisers Limited ('CVC') (CVC Capital Partners Limited), Nordic Capital XI Delta, SCSP (acting through its general partner Nordic Capital XI Delta GP SARL) ('Nordic Capital'), and Platinum Ivy B 2018 RSC Limited ('Platinum Ivy'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ('ADIA') managed by the Private Equities investment department of ADIA (together, the 'Consortium') to acquire Hargreaves Lansdown at a price of 1,140 pence per Hargreaves Lansdown share in cash (the 'Revised Possible Cash Offer'), of which 30 pence comprises a FY2024 final dividend, with an option for Hargreaves Lansdown shareholders to elect for a rollover equity alternative in respect of some or all of their Hargreaves Lansdown shares. The rollover equity alternative would provide participating Hargreaves Lansdown shareholders the opportunity to re-invest their shareholding and co-invest in the Consortium's unlisted acquisition vehicle on an economically pari passu basis, subject to an overall maximum participation of 35% of the equity in the unlisted vehicle and limitations on transferability. The Revised Proposal is subject to a number of pre-conditions, including completion of satisfactory due diligence and agreement of definitive transaction documentation.
This Revised Proposal follows three previous approaches from the Consortium in recent months. The Board remains confident in management's ability to execute Hargreaves Lansdown's strategic priorities and in Hargreaves Lansdown's fundamental longer term prospects. However, having evaluated the Revised Possible Cash Offer, which would provide the certainty of value in cash to shareholders, the Board has decided to engage with the Consortium and provide confirmatory due diligence access.
The Board has confirmed to the Consortium that the Revised Possible Cash Offer is at a value that the Board would be willing to recommend unanimously to Hargreaves Lansdown shareholders, should a firm intention to make an offer pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the Code be announced on such financial terms and subject to agreement on other key terms of the Consortium's proposal and definitive transaction documentation. In accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code, the Board has requested, and the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the 'Panel') has consented to, an extension to the date by which the Consortium must either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Hargreaves Lansdown under Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for Hargreaves Lansdown, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. Such announcement must now be made by not later than 5.00 pm on 19 July 2024.
This deadline may only be extended with the agreement of Hargreaves Lansdown and the Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code. This announcement has been made without the prior consent of the Consortium. As a result, there can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made for Hargreaves Lansdown, nor as to the terms on which any firm offer might be made.
A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Dan Olley (CEO)', 1: 'Amy Stirling (DFI)', 2: 'Amanda Shepherd (COO)', 3: 'Birger Thorburn (CTO)', 4: 'Robert Byett (CMP)', 5: 'Toby Vaughan (CIO)', 6: 'James Found (IRC)', 7: 'Ruchir Rodrigues (PRN)', 8: 'Emma Wall (PRN)', 9: 'Stephen Lefley (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Operating Officer', 3: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 4: 'Compliance Officer', 5: 'Chief Investment Officer', 6: 'Investor Relations Contact', 7: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 9: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '-', 1: '55', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '50', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '-', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '19-05-31', 1: '22-02-20', 2: '21-06-30', 3: '21-08-31', 4: '14-02-28', 5: '23-05-30', 6: '-', 7: '22-09-30', 8: '-', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'John Troiano (BRD)', 1: 'Mansurah Talat Mannings (BRD)', 2: 'Michael Morley (BRD)', 3: 'Adrian John Reginald Collins (BRD)', 4: 'Darren Pope (BRD)', 5: 'Amy Stirling (DFI)', 6: 'Alison Platt (CHM)', 7: 'Andrea Blance (BRD)', 8: 'Dan Olley (CEO)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 6: 'Chairman', 7: 'Director/Board Member', 8: 'Chief Executive Officer'}, 'Age': {0: '65', 1: '61', 2: '-', 3: '70', 4: '58', 5: '55', 6: '-', 7: '59', 8: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '19-12-31', 1: '20-08-31', 2: '23-07-31', 3: '20-11-01', 4: '22-08-31', 5: '22-02-20', 6: 'Feb. 05', 7: '20-08-31', 8: '19-05-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Hargreaves Lansdown Savings Ltd.

The private equity firm founded by former Pacific Equity Partners operatives is understood to have hired investment UBS to revive the sale process for its New Zealand smallgoods business Hellers Limited. Meanwhile, Adamantem Capital - as well as Downer EDI Limited (ASX:DOW) - are selling their laundries business, Linen Services Australia, DataRoom understands.
Lazard is understood to be working to find a buyer of 100% of the business, once known as Spotless Laundries, and the understanding is that two of the industry heavyweights based in France are within its sights. This includes Elis, which has looked at Spotless before. Adamantem paid $155 million for a 70% stake in the business when it was up for sale by Downer, which had been keen to sell the entire company, which former Downer boss Grant Fenn considered capital intensive.
Hellers has been up for sale before through investment bank Credit Suisse, which UBS now owns. The sale could be a challenging assignment, with industry heavyweight JBS operating as the other major smallgoods operator across the Tasman.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Peter John Tompkins (CEO)', 1: 'Malcolm Ashcroft (DFI)', 2: 'Adam Halmarick (IRC)', 3: 'Julie Wills (PRN)', 4: 'Louis Nucifora (PRN)', 5: 'Robert Regan (LAW)', 6: 'Peter Lyons (SEC)', 7: 'Jan O’Neill (HRO)', 8: 'Ashley Mason (PRN)', 9: 'Jon Newbery (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Investor Relations Contact', 3: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 4: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 5: 'General Counsel', 6: 'Corporate Secretary', 7: 'Human Resources Officer', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 9: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '45', 1: '-', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '-', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '07-12-31', 1: '23-06-30', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '18-12-31', 6: '11-06-30', 7: '22-12-31', 8: '23-08-10', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Mark Menhinnitt (CHM)', 1: 'Steve MacDonald (BRD)', 2: 'Nicole M Hollows (BRD)', 3: 'Adelle Maree Howse (BRD)', 4: 'Peter John Tompkins (CEO)', 5: 'Sheridan Broadbent (BRD)', 6: 'Teresa Gayle Handicott (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chairman', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Chief Executive Officer', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '59', 1: '-', 2: '53', 3: '53', 4: '45', 5: '-', 6: '61'}, 'Since': {0: '22-02-28', 1: '23-08-31', 2: '18-05-31', 3: '22-03-31', 4: '07-12-31', 5: '23-09-30', 6: '16-08-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Downer Group Finance Pty Ltd.

The company will sell 5% in the drugmaker for about $172 million through block trade, according to terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg News.

It will carry out more block sales in the coming months to shore up its balance sheet unless buyout firms make an offer, according to people familiar with the matter.
Fosun Pharma?s high valuation expectations for Gland Pharma have been a hurdle to a potential sale to private equity firms, they said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.

MAHB holds a 100% stake in ISGA through its Turkish unit Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Uluslararasi Havalimani Yatirim Yapim ve Isletme AS.
Both parties were unable to reach an agreement on some of the salient terms of an earlier memorandum of understanding signed between MAHB and IC Holding. Following the expiry of the MoU recently, and with no agreement to extend it, the MoU has lapsed, a source tells The Edge. Sources say the MoU had hinged upon approval of the Turkish government, through its defence industry agency Savunma Sanayii Bakanl (SSB), for the divestment to IC Holding, but the approval is yet to be granted.
The approval has not been granted yet and the MoU has expired. The MoU set out the framework for the divestment to be negotiated and the time for when the divestment is to be done, the source says. The Edge previously reported that MAHB was in advanced negotiations with IC Holding to divest part of its stake in ISGA and, if a deal is struck, the two would jointly run the airport.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Mohamed bin Rastam Shahrom (CEO)', 1: 'Gordon Andrew Stewart (COO)', 2: 'Vijaykumar Dayinde (CTO)', 3: 'Nor Azlina binti Mohammad Isa (CTO)', 4: 'Zeid Abdul Razak (IRC)', 5: 'Abdullah Kadir Bacha (IRO)', 6: 'Sharath Verma (SAM)', 7: 'Megat Ardian Wira Mohammad Aminuddin (PRN)', 8: 'Boon Teck Chang (PRN)', 9: 'Nor Aida Othman (LAW)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Chief Operating Officer', 2: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 3: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 4: 'Investor Relations Contact', 5: 'Public Communications Contact', 6: 'Sales & Marketing', 7: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 9: 'General Counsel'}, 'Age': {0: '53', 1: '56', 2: '45', 3: '49', 4: '43', 5: '71', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '59', 9: '55'}, 'Since': {0: '19-12-31', 1: '23-09-30', 2: '19-11-30', 3: '21-01-31', 4: '14-04-30', 5: '13-12-31', 6: '-', 7: '21-02-28', 8: '15-12-31', 9: '11-12-31'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Rohaya binti Mohammad Yusof (BRD)', 1: 'Ramanathan Sathiamutty (BRD)', 2: 'Mohamad bin Husin (BRD)', 3: 'Zainun binti Ali (CHM)', 4: 'Zamzuri bin Abdul Aziz (BRD)', 5: 'Hui Peng Khor (BRD)', 6: 'Peng Kang Koe (BRD)', 7: 'Mohd Mohd (Khir)', 8: 'Amran Hafiz Affifudin (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Chairman', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: '', 8: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '59', 1: '60', 2: '70', 3: '72', 4: '54', 5: '50', 6: '63', 7: '46', 8: '50'}, 'Since': {0: '21-09-30', 1: '18-12-31', 2: '16-08-14', 3: '19-01-16', 4: '23-06-04', 5: '22-07-24', 6: 'Dec. 11', 7: '-', 8: '23-08-31'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'MAHB (Mauritius) Pte Ltd.

On June 14, 2024, the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) gave an oral order to admit Jaypee Healthcare for corporate insolvency and resolution process on a petition filed by JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Company. A written order is yet to be uploaded by the tribunal on its website.
Manoj Gaur-promoted Jaiprakash Associates was admitted for corporate insolvency process this month, while a Suraksha Realty-led consortium has already taken control of Gaur's other company, Jaypee Infratech, under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Jaypee Healthcare, a multi-speciality tertiary care hospital located at Jaypee Wish Town in Noida, is a subsidiary of Jaypee Infratech. JC Flowers ARC, Bank of Baroda, Exim Bank, Punjab National Bank and Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil) are among its lenders, according to a disclosure made by Care Ratings.
Its total debt (including the interest component) is about INR 10,000 million. Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Medanta and Max Healthcare did not respond to ET's request for comment. The tribunal has appointed Bhuvan Madan, backed by PwC, as the interim resolution professional for the company, while lenders have appointed Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas as their advisor.
Yes Bank had extended a loan to Jaypee Infratech with Jaypee Healthcare shares as security. In March 2023, JC Flowers ARC (which acquired loans from Yes Bank) invoked the share pledge and became a 63.6% stakeholder in the hospital operator. The balance stake was held by Jaypee Infratech.
The hospital chains interested in acquiring Jaypee Healthcare had earlier approached both the ARC and Suraksha Realty that had acquired Jaypee Infratech, said people familiar with the development. Last month, Suraksha, with a 36% equity stake, pleaded before the NCLT that it was in talks with Jaypee Healthcare's lenders for an out-of-court debt settlement. However, the settlement did not materialise, said a person familiar with the development.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Abhay Soi (CEO)', 1: 'Yogesh Kumar Sareen (DFI)', 2: 'Mradul Kaushik (COO)', 3: 'Prashant Singh (CTO)', 4: 'Sandeep Budhiraja (CTO)', 5: 'Dhiraj Aroraa (CMP)', 6: 'Keshav Gupta (IRC)', 7: 'Sachin Kumar (AUD)', 8: 'Mayank Mathur (SAM)', 9: 'Ambrish Mithal (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Operating Officer', 3: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 4: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 5: 'Compliance Officer', 6: 'Investor Relations Contact', 7: 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 8: 'Sales & Marketing', 9: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '50', 1: '60', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '-', 9: '66'}, 'Since': {0: '19-06-20', 1: '12-01-14', 2: '19-06-30', 3: '19-06-30', 4: '01-01-02', 5: '23-02-02', 6: '-', 7: '-', 8: '23-09-11', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Kummamuri Narasimha Murthy (BRD)', 1: 'Narayan Keelveedhi Seshadri (BRD)', 2: 'Michael Neeb (BRD)', 3: 'Mahendra Gumanmal Lodha (BRD)', 4: 'Amrita Gangotra (BRD)', 5: 'Abhay Soi (CEO)', 6: 'Pranav Chirayu Amin (BRD)', 7: 'Anil Bhatnagar (BRD)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Chief Executive Officer', 6: 'Director/Board Member', 7: 'Director/Board Member'}, 'Age': {0: '66', 1: '67', 2: '61', 3: '67', 4: '57', 5: '50', 6: '48', 7: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '09-08-25', 1: '23-05-15', 2: '19-06-20', 3: '19-06-20', 4: '23-08-22', 5: '19-06-20', 6: '22-08-09', 7: '22-08-30'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Radiant Life Care Mumbai Pvt (Ltd.)', 1: 'Alps Hospital Ltd.

(NasdaqGS:CG) is exploring a sale of power producer Cogentrix Energy (Cogentrix Energy Power Management, LLC), one of the largest owners of power plants in the US, as a wave of deals for utilities accelerates because of soaring energy demands from digital networks. The private capital group has hired advisers to explore a sale that could value Cogentrix at as much as $3 billion-$4 billion, generating a large windfall for Carlyle?s infrastructure arm, said three people briefed on the matter. It was also selling other power assets owned by its infrastructure business in separate processes, the people said.
Investment bank Lazard (Lazard Inc.) and law firm Latham & Watkins (Latham & Watkins LLP) had been hired to advise on the sale, said people briefed about the matter. Carlyle and Lazard declined to comment. Latham did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Investment bankers and lawyers say investors are increasingly looking to buy and invest in power plants, which generate electricity that is later sold to utilities. That wave of deal making has been in part spurred by speculation that data centres and digital infrastructure used to power artificial intelligence will spark an unprecedented demand for power, straining the energy supply.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'David Rubenstein (FOU)', 1: 'William Conway (FOU)', 2: 'Harvey Schwartz (CEO)', 3: 'John Redett (DFI)', 4: 'Ruulke Bagijn (CIO)', 5: 'Lúcia Soares (CTO)', 6: 'Bethany de Lude (CTO)', 7: 'Christopher Finn (COO)', 8: 'Catherine Ziobro (CMP)', 9: 'Jason Thomas (CTO)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Founder', 1: 'Founder', 2: 'Chief Executive Officer', 3: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 4: 'Chief Investment Officer', 5: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 6: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 7: 'Chief Operating Officer', 8: 'Compliance Officer', 9: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer'}, 'Age': {0: '74', 1: '74', 2: '60', 3: '56', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '-', 7: '66', 8: '-', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '86-12-31', 1: '86-12-31', 2: '23-02-14', 3: '06-12-31', 4: '19-04-30', 5: '18-12-31', 6: '20-12-31', 7: '19-02-28', 8: '03-12-31', 9: '10-11-30'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'William Shaw (BRD)', 1: 'Lawton Fitt (BRD)', 2: 'Linda Filler (BRD)', 3: 'Derica Rice (BRD)', 4: 'Anthony Welters (BRD)', 5: 'James Hance (BRD)', 6: 'William Conway (FOU)', 7: 'David Rubenstein (FOU)', 8: ""Daniel D'Aniello (FOU)"", 9: 'Harvey Schwartz (CEO)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Director/Board Member', 1: 'Director/Board Member', 2: 'Director/Board Member', 3: 'Director/Board Member', 4: 'Director/Board Member', 5: 'Director/Board Member', 6: 'Founder', 7: 'Founder', 8: 'Founder', 9: 'Chief Executive Officer'}, 'Age': {0: '78', 1: '70', 2: '64', 3: '59', 4: '69', 5: '79', 6: '74', 7: '74', 8: '77', 9: '60'}, 'Since': {0: '12-05-01', 1: '12-05-01', 2: '22-03-31', 3: '21-03-07', 4: '15-10-26', 5: '05-10-31', 6: '86-12-31', 7: '86-12-31', 8: '86-12-31', 9: '23-02-14'}}, 'Name': {'Name': {0: 'Abingworth Bioventures V (LP)', 1: 'Abingworth Bioventures V Co-Invest Growth Equity Fund (LP)', 2: 'OE Holdings LLC OE Holdings LLCFinancial ConglomeratesFinancePart of Jelany Corp.

GIH as the controlling shareholder is convinced of the merits of moving the business into private ownership and intends to seek delisting of the Company and taking it private. Although as a standard listed company delisting can be implemented through a decision by the board of directors of the Company and neither a shareholder vote nor a squeeze-out is required, GIH is considering a possible cash offer of USD 3.00 per share (the ""Offer Price""),to be implemented by GIH's wholly owned subsidiary, Global Ports Holding B.V. (""Bidco""),for the issued and to be issued share capital of the Company not already owned by Bidco, as a liquidity opportunity in conjunction with the delisting.
GIH and Bidco are in discussions with potential providers of funding. There can be no certainty that an offer will be made. Under Rule 2.6(a) of the Code, Bidco must, by no later than 5.00 pm on 12 July 2024, either announce a firm intention to make an offer for the Company in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code, or announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies.
This deadline will only be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code. In accordance with Rule 2.5(a) of the Code, Bidco reserves the right to make an offer for the Company at a lower value than the Offer Price: (i) with the agreement or recommendation of the Board of the Company; (ii) if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for the Company which, at that date, is of a value less than the value of the Offer Price; or (iii) following the announcement by the Company of a Rule 9 waiver transaction pursuant to Appendix 1 of the Code or a reverse takeover (as defined in the Code). If the Company declares, makes or pays any further dividend or distribution or other return of value or payment to its shareholders, Bidco reserves the right to make an equivalent reduction to the Offer Price.
Bidco reserves the right to vary the form and /or mix of the consideration it would offer.

Vodafone currently owns 21.5% of mobile-tower operator Indus via various group entities, valuing the investment at $2.3 billion as of June 14, 2024?s stock price in Mumbai. The final size of the stake sale is yet to be decided and could be lower than 21.5% if demand, which is still being assessed, is insufficient, the sources said.
They declined to be named as the discussions are private. Vodafone India and its UK parent did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Indus Towers declined to comment.
Vodafone plans to sell the stake via block deals in Indian stock markets next week and has hired Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas to manage the deal, the sources said. The banks did not respond to queries.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Margherita della Valle (CEO)', 1: 'Luka Mucic (DFI)', 2: 'Scott Petty (CTO)', 3: 'Matthew Johnson (IRC)', 4: 'Marc Sauter (PRN)', 5: 'Michael Bird (PRN)', 6: 'Joakim Reiter (PRN)', 7: 'Maaike de Bie (LAW)', 8: 'Leanne Wood (HRO)', 9: 'Aldo Bisio (PRN)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 5: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 7: 'General Counsel', 8: 'Human Resources Officer', 9: 'Corporate Officer/Principal'}, 'Age': {0: '58', 1: '53', 2: '-', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '42', 6: '50', 7: '-', 8: '50', 9: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '-', 1: '23-08-31', 2: '08-12-31', 3: '-', 4: '-', 5: '-', 6: '17-07-31', 7: '23-02-28', 8: '19-03-31', 9: '15-09-30'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'David Nish (BRD)', 1: 'Stephen Carter (BRD)', 2: 'Michel Demaré (BRD)', 3: 'Margherita della Valle (CEO)', 4: 'Simon Segars (BRD)', 5: 'Jean-François M.

Keywords Studios shareholders on the register on 24 May 2024 will also be entitled to receive the 2023 final dividend of 1.76 pence, as recommended on 13 March 2024, and payable on 28 June 2024 (?2023 Final Dividend?).
In accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the Code, EQT was required, by not later than 5.00 p.m. on 15 June 2024 (the ?PUSU Deadline?), to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Keywords Studios in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. To facilitate the finalisation of EQT's confirmatory due diligence, the Company has requested, and the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the ?Takeover Panel?) has consented to, an extension of the PUSU Deadline. Consequently, in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code, EQT is now required, by not later than 5.00 pm on 28 June 2024, either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Keywords Studios in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for Keywords Studios, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies.
In accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code, the revised deadline may be extended further at the request of the Board of Keywords Studios and with the consent of the Takeover Panel. In accordance with Rule 2.5(a) of the Code, EQT reserves the right to make an offer for Keywords Studios at a lower value or on less favourable terms than the Possible Offer: (i) with the agreement or recommendation of the Board of Keywords Studios; (ii) if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for Keywords Studios which, at that date, is of a value less than the value of the Possible Offer; or (iii) following the announcement by Keywords Studios of a Rule 9 waiver transaction pursuant to Appendix 1 of the Code or a reverse takeover (as defined in the Code). If Keywords Studios declares, makes or pays any further dividend or distribution or other return of value or payment to its shareholders, other than the 2023 Final Dividend, EQT reserves the right to make an equivalent reduction to the Possible Offer.
In connection with the possibility of EQT making a cash offer for Keywords Studios (if it were so inclined), EQT reserves the right to vary the form and /or mix of the consideration it would offer.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Bertrand Bodson (CEO)', 1: 'Robert Kingston (DFI)', 2: 'Jonathan Hauck (COO)', 3: 'Giles Blackham (IRC)', 4: 'Andrew Kennedy (LAW)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Operating Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'General Counsel'}, 'Age': {0: '49', 1: '53', 2: '51', 3: '-', 4: '-'}, 'Since': {0: '21-09-19', 1: '23-06-30', 2: '19-10-13', 3: '22-08-31', 4: '19-12-31'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Don Robert (CHM)', 1: 'Marion Sears (BRD)', 2: 'Bertrand Bodson (CEO)', 3: 'Robert Kingston (DFI)', 4: 'Maria Ginman-Horrell (BRD)', 5: 'Georges Marceau R.

149,Temasek Reportedly to Be Finalising Pavilion Energy Deal with Shell,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SHELL-PLC-130945922/news/Temasek-Reportedly-to-Be-Finalising-Pavilion-Energy-Deal-with-Shell-46997556/,SHEL,Jun. 13,S&P Capital IQ,"Singapore's investment company, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, is finalising the sale of some assets from liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading company Pavilion Energy Pte. Ltd. to Shell plc (LSE:SHEL), with a deal set to be completed in the coming days, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. The deal will provide Shell, already the world's top LNG trader, with access to gas markets in Europe and Singapore as it aggressively expands its LNG footprint after raking in billions of profits in 2023.
The deal's value will be in the hundreds of millions of US dollars, one of the sources said. That would be below what Temasek had originally sought from the sale. Reuters reported in April that Shell and Saudi Aramco had been in advanced talks to buy the assets from Temasek, which had sought to fetch more than $2 billion (SGD 2.7 billion) from the deal.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. Temasek, Pavilion Energy and Shell declined to comment. The deal comes months after Temasek put the Singapore-based trader up for sale after Pavilion Energy turned in a profit in the year to March 2023 on robust LNG prices in the wake of the Ukraine war.
Shell has been supplying a quarter of Singapore's natural gas needs, and the deal will make it the biggest supplier to the Republic. However, the Pavilion Energy asset sale will exclude Gas Supply, which has a licence to import natural gas by pipeline from Indonesia, the sources said, due to energy security concerns. Temasek set up Pavilion Energy a decade ago to focus on LNG-related investments.","{'Managers': {'Managers': {0: 'Wael Sawan (CEO)', 1: 'Sinead Gorman (DFI)', 2: 'Robin Mooldijk (CTO)', 3: 'Tjerk Huysinga (IRC)', 4: 'Philippa Bounds (LAW)', 5: 'Caroline Omloo (SEC)', 6: 'Steve Hill (PRN)', 7: 'Huibert Vigeveno (PRN)', 8: 'Zoë Yujnovich (PRN)', 9: 'Andrew John Gowdy Morrison (SAM)'}, 'Title': {0: 'Chief Executive Officer', 1: 'Director of Finance/CFO', 2: 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 3: 'Investor Relations Contact', 4: 'General Counsel', 5: 'Corporate Secretary', 6: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 7: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 8: 'Corporate Officer/Principal', 9: 'Sales & Marketing'}, 'Age': {0: '50', 1: '47', 2: '58', 3: '-', 4: '54', 5: '55', 6: '-', 7: '55', 8: '49', 9: '63'}, 'Since': {0: '21-10-24', 1: '98-12-31', 2: '90-12-31', 3: '88-12-31', 4: '04-12-31', 5: '98-12-31', 6: '-', 7: '94-12-31', 8: '13-12-31', 9: '-'}}, 'Members of the board': {'Members of the board': {0: 'Cyrus Taraporevala (BRD)', 1: 'Neil Carson (BRD)', 2: 'Catherine Hughes (BRD)', 3: 'A.
