Singapore's central bank establishes review group in bid to revive its stock market development,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/mas-sets-up-review-group-in-bid-to-revive-its-sgx-development.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105995951-1561944910214gettyimages-520347272.jpeg?v=1636431599&w=884&h=442&vtcrop=y,3 days ago - CNBC News,2024-08-02,"In this article
Singapore's central bank established a task force to bolster the city-state's stock market.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that the review group will evaluate measures to ""improve the vibrancy"" of the Singapore equities market.
MAS said on Friday the panel will focus on addressing market challenges, fostering listings, and facilitating market revitalization, as well as enhancing regulations to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.
It said another key goal will be to identify methods for encouraging private sector participation, including from capital market intermediaries, investors and listed companies. 
The authority noted that a ""dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain,"" and that a liquid market enables companies to not only access capital as they expand, but also ""allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies.""
""Improving the attractiveness of Singapore's equities market can therefore enhance Singapore's standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub,"" the MAS said, adding that this will also ""[complement] Singapore's innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.""
Despite the Straits Times Index rising in three of the last four years including 2024, Singapore's stock market has been long plagued by thin trading volumes and more delistings than listings. This has led observers to describe the exchange as ""boring,"" ""unexciting"" and even once in 2021, a ""zombie"" bourse.
Turnover velocity at the SGX, a measure of market liquidity, stood at 36% for the whole of 2023, compared to 57.35% at the Hong Kong Exchange in the same period, and 103.6% at the Japan Exchange.
Analysts who previously spoke to CNBC outlined ways to revive interest in the SGX, including taking lessons from ""value up programs"" in Japan and South Korea.
The review group announced Friday will be chaired by Chee Hong Tat, Singapore's second minister of finance, and also include members like Koh Boon Hwee, the current chairman of the SGX.
The SGX said it welcomes the announcement and pledged to work closely with the review group.SGX RegCo, the regulatory arm of the exchange, will also aim to ""increase accountability, transparency and market discipline.""""Only a whole-of-ecosystem approach can lead to transformative actions that will give fresh impetus to improving liquidity and listings in Singapore's equities market,"" SGX said in a statement to CNBC."
"China securities official expected to lead Shenzhen stock exchange, Reuters reports",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/china-securities-official-expected-to-lead-shenzhen-stock-exchange.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107007807-1643337444460-gettyimages-1267455437-vcg111295937601.jpeg?v=1722559314&w=412&h=442&vtcrop=y,4 days ago - CNBC News,2024-08-01,"China is expected to appoint a senior securities official to head its second-largest bourse, four sources said, filling a role that has been vacant for the unusually long period of seven months as the securities regulator reshuffled its leadership.
Li Jizun, a civil servant who is now director of the general office at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is set to become general manager of the 27-trillion-yuan ($3.73-trillion) Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the sources said.
The role is the exchange's second most senior executive position and will see Li, whose appointment was finalized last week, move from the capital Beijing to the southern boom city of Shenzhen in the next few weeks, said two of the sources.
All the sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The CSRC and the Shenzhen exchange did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. Li could not be immediately reached for comment.
Born in 1974, Li has headed the regulator's general office since 2022, overseeing day-to-day operations and managing the administrative affairs of its top leadership, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter and Chinese media.
A former State Council official, Li began working at the CSRC in 2016, first in the research center mainly charged with studying and drafting strategies for capital markets and then heading the markets department overseeing infrastructure such as settlement and custody as well as risk management.
He was also deeply involved in the CSRC's capital market reform measures that include the launch of Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market and the pilot of a U.S.-style registration system for stock market floats, domestic media said.
Li's appointment comes after the exchange's former general manager, Sha Yan, was promoted as its Communist Party chief in December.
It is a common practice at state-owned institutions and firms for the party chief to also hold the position of chairman.
Sha had worked at the securities regulator for more than two decades before taking over at the Shenzhen exchange in mid-2020, after her predecessor Wang Jianjun was promoted to the party chief role before returning to the regulator as a vice chairman.
It is also common practice for CSRC officials to lead one of the main stock exchanges to strengthen their credentials and leadership capabilities before they return to the regulator in a more senior position.
Wang, also a CSRC veteran, served as the director of the general office before his tenure at the Shenzhen exchange.
Founded in 1990 in what was then a fishing village, the Shenzhen exchange has fast developed to become China's largest stock market after the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and one of the world's busiest markets for IPOs.
Shenzhen is a key tech and manufacturing hub, and its exchange has had a key role in raising funds for companies in the tech and healthcare sectors.
Last year, its start-up board ChiNext took the global crown for IPO volumes, with $16.4 billion raised, LSEG data shows.
The CSRC is in the midst of re-organizing its own leadership.
On Tuesday, the regulator promoted Li Ming, its law enforcement head, to the role of vice chairman, replacing Fang Xinghai, in a step that confirmed an earlier report by Reuters.
In February, Wu Qing, a former deputy party chief in the financial hub of Shanghai, took over as CSRC chairman when stock markets were near their lowest in five years and after several warnings against short-selling and other steps to arrest the slide by his predecessor Yi Huiman failed."
SoftBank-backed Ola Electric to raise $734m in India's biggest IPO this year,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/softbank-backed-ola-electric-aims-to-raise-734-million-in-indias-biggest-ipo-this-year.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107428712-1718293652888-gettyimages-1234690305-AFP_9L69QR.jpeg?v=1718293715&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-07-29,"Indian e-scooter maker Ola Electric said on Monday it aimed to raise $734 million in this year's biggest domestic IPO, with foreign investors eyeing the offering after the SoftBank-backed firm was valued at a sharply lower $4 billion.
The IPO comes amid a stock market boom in India, as more than 150 companies have raised nearly $5 billion through public listings between January and July, nearly double the figure of the corresponding period last year, LSEG data shows.
The first IPO by an Indian electric vehicle maker will let investors bet on a clean energy push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, as well as firms from Tata Motors and TVS to Hyundai Motor.
""Tesla is for the West and Ola for the rest,"" has become a catchphrase best linked to the firm's chairman, Bhavish Aggarwal, who is betting big on cleaner vehicles, after having often publicly criticized gasoline and diesel vehicles.
With e-scooter prices starting at around $900, Ola Electric has become the biggest player in a country where adoption of clean vehicles is still low, but rising rapidly. It has 46% of the e-scooter market despite slashing sales goals last year.
A term sheet showed the IPO, which will run from Aug. 1 to Aug. 6, puts a value of $4 billion on the company, which sold its first scooter in 2021.
That valuation is about 25% lower than Ola's last funding round in September, led by Singapore's investment firm Temasek which valued the EV maker at $5.4 billion.
The lower figure stems from a correction in the valuation of global tech companies, while Ola also wants to attract participants to the stock offering, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The IPO is set to draw investor bids from Fidelity, Nomura and Norges Bank at the $4 billion valuation, as well as several Indian mutual funds, sources who asked not to be identified told Reuters.
In the IPO, Ola will issue new shares to raise $657 million while existing investors offload their stake of about $77 million to IPO investors, the term sheet showed.
The company unveiled the price band of 72 rupees to 76 rupees ($0.86-$0.91) in an advertisement in the Financial Express newspaper, with a discount of 7 rupees a share for some eligible employees.
Aggarwal and investors such as SoftBank and Matrix Partners will sell part of their stakes in the IPO.
Monday's newspaper ad showed 10% of the IPO will be reserved for retail investors, with proceeds going to fund capital expenditure and research and development efforts.
Aggarwal also had plans to start selling an electric car in 2024, but Reuters reported they have been suspended to let the company focus on e-scooters. It also plans a foray into electric motorcycles.
The company, which disrupted the two-wheeler market forcing a pivot by incumbents such as TVS, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto, reported a loss of 15.84 billion rupees ($189 million) before tax in the fiscal year 2023-24."

Lineage closes up more than 3% in market’s largest IPO of 2024,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/25/lineage-goes-public-largest-ipo-2024.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108011798-17219219432024-07-25t151946z_216025317_rc2e29azbta0_rtrmadp_0_lineage-ipo.jpeg?v=1721922056&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-07-25,"Lineage, the largest temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust (REIT) in the world, closed up more than 3% in its Nasdaq Stock Market debut on Thursday, after going public under the ticker symbol ""LINE.""
Lineage priced 57 million shares at $78 apiece on Wednesday, near the top of its initial $70 to $82 target range. The company raised $4.4 billion at an implied valuation over $18 billion, making it the largest public offering since chip designer Arm's $4.8 billion listing last September and more than twice the size of cruise operator Viking Holdings, which went public in May.
Lineage is a four-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company that ranked No. 46 on this year's list.
One of the biggest factors in the company's success is its aggressive acquisition strategy.
""We started with one warehouse and we've done 116 acquisitions to turn Lineage into what it is today,"" co-founder and co-executive chairman Adam Forste said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday morning before shares started trading.
In the last year alone, Lineage has acquired Grupo Fuentes, Burris Logistics, Kennedy Transportation and Harnes. The Burris acquisition alone gave Lineage eight new facilities.
""So many families who we've bought companies from rolled equity into Lineage as part of their transaction, so they're celebrating here today with us as well,"" Forste said, adding that the company's namesake is derived from the network, or lineage, of family-owned warehouses that he and co-founder Kevin Marchetti have brought into the fold.
Lineage has amassed over 480 facilities, totaling roughly 2.9 billion cubic feet of capacity across countries in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. These locations create a global network of cold-storage facilities, reducing supply chain food waste and its environmental impact.
Food loss happens at every level of the supply chain, with an estimated $600 billion worth of food going to waste during or just after harvest. That ever-growing amount of waste currently accounts for about 11% of the world's emissions – making it one of the biggest environmental issues contributing to climate change.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo were the lead underwriters for Lineage's offering.

The video game developer, which counts Chinese internet giant Tencent as its second largest shareholder, saw its shares climb as high as 89,500 South Korean won (about $64.89) apiece, a 49.17% gain from its initial public offering price of 60,000 won.
The company sold 7.25 million shares in its IPO, raising 435 billion won or about $315.56 million. At the offering price, the company would be valued at 3.48 trillion won, according to CNBC's calculations.
Demand was strong with institutional investors oversubscribing by almost 226 times the institutional allocation and the general offering over 341 times oversubscribed.
This is South Korea's largest IPO since the debut of maintenance and repair firm HD Hyundai Marine Solution in May.
Shift Up was established in 2013, but only gained prominence in 2024 after it released Stellar Blade, a PlayStation 5 exclusive that topped sales in the PlayStation stores of eight countries. It became the best selling game in the U.S. for April, despite being released on April 26.
In just two months, the game had sold over one million copies. Shift Up also makes the free-to-play game Goddess of Victory: Nikke, released in 2022.
The company reported sales of 168.6 billion won in 2023, up 155.2% year-on-year."
UK launches new listing rules in bid to boost growth for London's stock exchange,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/uk-launches-new-listing-rules-in-bid-to-boost-london-stock-exchange.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108003880-1720621944820-gettyimages-1246744992-Vuk_Valcic_City_020223_1.jpeg?v=1720621997&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,3 weeks ago - CNBC News,2024-07-11,"The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced Thursday new rules for the country's stock market listings in a bid to boost growth following a slow down in IPOs.
The new rules — which come into effect from July 29 — will ensure the U.K.'s listing system is more in line with those in other markets, and will make it simpler and more streamlined, the FCA said in a statement.
The measures mark the biggest change to the listing regime in over three decades, the FCA said. ""They aim to support a wider range of companies to issue their shares on a UK exchange, increasing opportunities for investors,"" the regulator added.
One key change is the removal of the 'premium' and 'standard' listing segments. Instead there will be one overall category for equity share listings, which has been named 'commercial companies.'
This ""should very much simplify the process,"" Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director for markets and international, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. 
Previously, there were complexities between the two categories, while the standard listing segment was not well understood, she said.
""We had overwhelming feedback and support from all parts of the market on the need to simplify and move to one straightforward category,"" Pritchard explained.
Premium listings previously had additional requirements compared to standard ones. Some of these will be carried over and now applied to all listings, while others have been scrapped.  
""The new rules remove the need for votes on significant or related party transactions and offer flexibility around enhanced voting rights. Shareholder approval for key events, like reverse takeovers and decisions to take the company's shares off an exchange, is still required,"" the FCA said.
Some rules around eligibility for listings will also change, such as the removal of a requirement for companies to provide track records of their revenue.
The rules are a positive move for the U.K. IPO market, but could have gone further, Chris Haynes, corporate partner at law firm Gibson Dunn told CNBC in emailed comments.
""The move to a single listing category with streamlined eligibility criteria, and to disclosure-based continuing obligations, is one of a number of important initiatives which, together, should lead to more UK IPO activity,"" he said.
""In my view the FCA could have created further flexibility in some areas, such as in relation to dual class share structures, however overall it's a good outcome,"" Haynes added.
The new rules come at a time when the European listings market, and the U.K.'s in particular, have slumped. Major tech companies have recently favored the U.S. for their listings, including British chip designer Arm which chose to list on New York's Nasdaq last year.
Euronext reported 64 equity listings on its platform last year, a significant drop from the 83 listings it welcomed in 2022.
The new rules were made in response to the 2021 U.K. Listing Review report which showed that the number of listed companies in the UK has declined by about 40% since 2008, and that only 5% of global IPOs between 2015 and 2020 took place in the U.K."
"Hong Kong's IPO market is finally starting to turn around, consulting firm EY says",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/ey-hong-kongs-ipo-market-is-set-to-improve-over-the-next-five-years.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108001260-1719986543474-gettyimages-2158666618-vcg111503310652.jpeg?v=1719986586&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-07-03,"BEIJING — The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday.
""I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,"" Chan said. ""I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.""
High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years.
EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings.
Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai.
""We are seeing a reversing trend,"" he told CNBC. ""We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.""
The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline — which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.
""Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2.  We expect to see many HKSE listings,"" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday.
Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. ""Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly."" 
In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change.
Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is ""quite satisfactory.""
He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries.
""As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,"" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country.
Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China — up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years.
Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs.
""I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,"" Chan said.
Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report.
In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 — a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.
Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications — a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan.
""The pipeline is building up nicely,"" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. ""All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,"" she added.
""What we need is a strong pipeline,"" EY's Chan said. ""We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.""
Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY.
""The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,"" Chan said. ""These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.""
Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.
He said those will likely be medium-sized — between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) — but added he expects better market momentum in 2025.
Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups.
Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm.
U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.
As for IPOs of China-based companies in the U.S., EY's Chan said he expects current scrutiny on the listings to be ""temporary,"" although data security rules would remain a hurdle.
In early 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission formalized new rules that require domestic companies to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas. A China-based company with more than 1 million users must pass Beijing's cybersecurity review to list overseas.
""As time goes on, when people are more familiar with the Chinese [securities regulator] approval process and they are more become comfortable with geopolitical tensions, more of the large companies ... would consider [the] U.S. market as their final destination,"" Chan said.
""When the time comes I think the institutional investors would be interested in these sizeable Chinese companies, as they pretty much want to make money.""
He declined to comment on specific IPOs, and said certain high-profile listing plans are ""isolated incidents.""
Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, which delisted from New York in 2021, has denied reports it plans to list in Hong Kong next year. Fast-fashion company Shein, which does most of its manufacturing in China, is trying to list in London following criticism in the U.S., according to a CNBC report."

Shein confidentially files for London IPO as U.S. listing stalls,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/shein-files-for-london-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107413924-1715606370233-gettyimages-2150274388-europapress_5918123_shein_sign_during_its_opening_at_abc_ser.jpeg?v=1719237369&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-24,"Shein, the fast fashion giant with links to China, has confidentially filed for a public listing in London as it faces backlash in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.
The person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the discussions, which are private.
The company had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in November but began looking toward London after it failed to win the support of American lawmakers.
Elected officials in the U.S. have repeatedly expressed concerns about the use of forced labor in Shein's supply chain and its use of a U.S. tax law exemption known as de minimis. Under the provision, packages valued at less than $800 are not charged import duties and aren't subject to the same levels of oversight from U.S. customs, which is tasked with screening packages to ensure items from banned regions don't come into the country.
Shein would still prefer to go public in the U.S., people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, and its filing in London doesn't mean that an IPO will happen there. Shein had previously sought China's approval to go public in the U.S. It's unclear if Beijing has signed off on the London listing.
Shein declined to comment to CNBC.
Reuters first reported that Shein had confidentially filed in London.
Shein, which was founded in China, has gone to great lengths to establish itself as a ""global"" company, moving its headquarters to Singapore in 2021. Still, the vast majority of its supply chain is still based in China, and the fact that it needed to seek Beijing's approval to go public in the U.S. means regulators there view it as a Chinese company — and could exert control over its operations and data.
Shein's London filing marks another twist in the company's so-far long road to a public markets debut. It crashed onto the U.S. fashion scene during the Covid-19 pandemic and won over consumers with its ability to quickly offer the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. It's been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based competitors, which have ceded market share to the digital upstart and struggled to match its speed.
As Shein's prominence in the U.S. grew, so did its ambitions to go public. It began waging a U.S. charm offensive as it sought to win the approval of lawmakers and the retail industry, but those efforts have not yet succeeded. Shein has applied for membership in the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, multiple times and has repeatedly been rejected, CNBC reported.
It's found itself caught in the crossfire of a tense geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing. American lawmakers, concerned about the influence companies with Chinese links can have on the U.S. economy, ramped up their scrutiny of Shein after it filed to go public. Some elected officials at the federal and state level have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the company's listing because they say it would violate a U.S. law that bans the import of products made from the Xinjiang region in China, where the government has faced accusations of genocide against the Uyghur ethnic group.
Shein has acknowledged to CNBC that raw materials from banned regions have been found in its supply chain, but previous tests show that it's done a better job, on average, of ridding such materials from its garments than the industry overall.
In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shein was considering a London IPO after the SEC told the retailer that its listing wouldn't be accepted unless it made its filing public — a request that experts told the Journal was unusual. Typically, companies file to go public confidentially so they can protect sensitive information surrounding their operations and financials as regulators review the filing.
Even so, Shein's executive chairman insisted that its ambitions to go public are about transparency, not about raising capital.
""Most companies seek to go public for liquidity reasons,"" Donald Tang told the Journal. ""We seek to go public to embrace scrutiny and public diligence.""

Luxury sneaker maker Golden Goose postpones IPO citing political turmoil in Europe,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/19/golden-goose-postpones-milan-ipo-citing-political-turmoil-in-europe.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107430818-1718776779614-gettyimages-1820747787-UK_GOLDEN_GOOSE.jpeg?v=1718776789&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-19,"Italian sportswear brand Golden Goose postponed its Milan IPO on the grounds that the European Parliament elections and the call for a snap election in France have led to ""significant deterioration"" in market conditions.
Golden Goose, known for its worn-looking trainers which have been made popular by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, was aiming for a market capitalization of up to 1.86 billion euros ($2 billion).
The ""current market backdrop is not the right environment to take the company public,"" the firm said in a Tuesday statement, adding that an IPO will be reassessed in due course.
The European Parliament elections and the calling of a general election in France impacted not only markets in Europe but the luxury sector in particular, Golden Goose said.
It stressed that the brand's IPO process had been ""engaged widely"" with investors. The first day of trading was due to take place on Friday.
France's far-right National Rally (RN) party won around 31% of the vote in the recent European Parliament elections, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap national election.
The record gains for the RN party sparked nationwide protests in France as demonstrators pushed back against rising nationalist sentiment. The French CAC 40 lost more than 6.2% last week to record its worst weekly loss since March 2022.
Golden Goose, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, announced last week that Invesco had committed 100 million euros to the listing as a cornerstone backer.

The confidential filing could take place as soon as the coming week, the report added, citing sources.
Chinese-founded Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Shein, valued at $66 billion in a fundraising last year, started engaging with the London-based teams of its financial and legal advisors to explore a listing on the London Stock Exchange early this year, sources told Reuters in May.
The fast-fashion company stepped up preparations for its London listing after its attempt to float itself in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from U.S. lawmakers.
However, senior British lawmakers are also questioning Shein's suitability for a London listing and calling for greater scrutiny of the business. Shein, in response, has said it is strengthening governance and compliance."
