"Japan, Tokyo governments target $4.7 bln valuation for Tokyo Metro in IPO, sources say",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JAPAN-EXCHANGE-GROUP-INC-12249999/news/Japan-Tokyo-governments-target-4-7-bln-valuation-for-Tokyo-Metro-in-IPO-sources-say-47680201/,8697,Reuters,"TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Japan's national and Tokyo
governments are seeking a 700 billion yen ($4.7 billion)
valuation for Tokyo Metro as they prepare to list the subway
operator as early as October-end, three sources said, in what
would be the nation's biggest IPO in roughly six years.
The two governments, which own 100% of Tokyo Metro, plan to
arrange a meeting of brokerages within a week for a briefing on
the IPO and expect to receive approval for the listing from the
Tokyo Stock Exchange as soon as mid-September, the sources said.
With half the company to be sold, the initial public
offering (IPO) could raise 350 billion yen at that valuation,
which would exceed the size of Kokusai Electric's IPO
last year and become the largest since SoftBank Group
listed its wireless unit in 2018.
The Tokyo government said the timing of the sale is being
discussed with the national government and is not decided. The
finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Tokyo
Metro said it would not comment on progress on the listing.
Japan Exchange Group, which operates the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said it cannot comment on specific companies.
The IPO follows the listing of other railway operators,
including Kyushu Railway (JR Kyushu) in 2016. Tokyo
Metro runs 195 kilometers (120 miles) of lines carrying 6.5
million passengers daily.
Tokyo Metro's history dates back to 1920 with the
establishment of the Tokyo Underground Railway Company. Seven
years later, it opened Japan's first subway line, between the
Asakusa and Ueno districts of Tokyo.
The company, whose business includes real estate and retail,
reported net profit jumped by two-thirds to 46 billion yen in
the financial year ended March 2024 as economic activity
rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The central government, which owns 53.4% of Tokyo Metro,
plans to use the funds raised to repay reconstruction bonds
issued following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The Tokyo
government holds the remaining 46.6% of the subway operator.
Nomura, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs are the joint global
coordinators for the listing.

China's BYD plans car plant in Karachi as part of Pakistan entry,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/THE-HUB-POWER-COMPANY-LIM-6492704/news/China-s-BYD-plans-car-plant-in-Karachi-as-part-of-Pakistan-entry-47678972/,HUBC,Reuters,"KARACHI (Reuters) -     Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD (002594.SZ) on Saturday announced plans to open a car production plant in Pakistan, where it will also start selling three models through a partnership with Mega Motors.
BYD is the first major new electric vehicle (NEV) entrant in the Pakistani market, where there is a lack of charging infrastructure.
""Our entry into the Pakistani market is not just about bringing advanced vehicles to consumers,"" said Liu Xueliang, BYD's general manager for Asia Pacific.
""It's about driving a broader vision of environmental responsibility and technological innovation.""
BYD also plans to open three ""flagship stores and experience centres"" in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the company said at a launch event in Lahore, adding it plans to start selling two SUV models and a sedan from the fourth quarter of 2024.
Mega Motors is a unit of Pakistan's largest private utility Hub Power Co Ltd (HPWR.PSX), known as Hubco.
""We will establish Pakistan's first NEV assembly plant... dedicated to producing BYD's cutting-edge new energy vehicles,"" said Hubco Chief Executive Kamran Kamal, who described the deal as a ""landmark investment"".
The new plant will begin operations in 2026, Kamal told Reuters.

"India's Ola Electric soars to $7 billion valuation on e-motorcycle launch, battery plan",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/OLA-ELECTRIC-MOBILITY-LIM-173418793/news/India-s-Ola-Electric-soars-to-7-billion-valuation-on-e-motorcycle-launch-battery-plan-47669309/,OLAELEC,Reuters,"BENGALURU (Reuters) -     India's top e-scooter maker Ola Electric Mobility surged 20% on Friday to reach a valuation of 586.64 billion rupees ($6.99 billion), after it launched a new line of motorcycles and on bets it will lower costs by using its own batteries.
The e-motorcycle launch is set to intensify competition in the world's second-largest two-wheeler market, where Ola Electric will face off with bigger rivals like Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor and Hero Motocorp.
Two-wheelers dominate Indian roads, with 18 million units sold last year.
Ola Electric, which listed its shares on Aug. 9 after a $734 million initial public offering (IPO), has seen its shares jump 75% over the launch price of 76 rupees.
It was valued at $5.4 billion in a September 2023 pre-IPO funding round. But Ola Electric had slashed its valuation target to $4 billion for its IPO due to a correction in global tech companies and to attract participants to the stock offering.
The e-scooter maker's plan to build an ""all-important"" battery and its efforts to make most of its EV parts in the country should attract investors looking to play the electrification theme in India, HSBC said in a note.
HSBC has a ""buy"" rating on the shares and a price target of 140 rupees, citing regulatory support and the company's ability to reduce costs.
On Wednesday, Ola Electric reported a wider first-quarter loss, hurt by subsidy cuts. On Thursday, the company launched a new series of e-motorcycles, expanding into an untapped segment. It plans to equip its vehicles with its own batteries by this time next year.
EV adoption is rising in India, but slowly, due to concerns around vehicles' range, lack of sufficient charging infrastructure and a low re-sale value.
Morgan Stanley said Ola Electric's motorcycle line addresses the ""mass and premium"" sides of the segment, noting that its close pricing to traditional motorcycles is likely to intensify competition.

regulatory commitments and technology-related costs.
Underlying net profit after tax fell to A$474.2 million
($313.5 million) for the fiscal year ended June 30, from A$491.1
million a year earlier. It was also below Visible Alpha
consensus estimates of A$478.5 million.
Shares fell as much as 3.3% to A$61.890 by 0035 GMT, making
ASX among the worst losers in the benchmark index.
ASX spent around A$430 million in the 2024 financial year,
roughly 15% higher than the prior year, on regulatory
obligations, technology initiatives, and employee-related costs.
It, however, reiterated its expense growth guidance of between
6% to 9% for the current financial year.
The exchange operator also flagged that it was ""starting to
see signs of a return to IPO (initial public offering) activity
... continue to see increasing levels of interest from companies
considering listing on ASX"".
""The more stable macro-economic conditions may be supportive
of an increase in listings activity, although ongoing
geopolitical instability may impact sentiment,"" it said.
Analysts at JPMorgan in a client note wrote that ""this
result is unlikely to be viewed as a catalyst for the stock
despite the prospect of better volumes in FY25E on rate
stabilization and potentially a better listing environment"".
Analysts at both JPMorgan and Citi also flagged that the
corporate regulator's investigation into the exchange operator's
handling of a troubled software upgrade remained an overhang on
the stock.
ASX was sued this week by the Australian Securities &
Investments Commission (ASIC) for allegedly ""misleading"" the
public about the progress of a switch to a new blockchain-based
clearing and settlement platform.

Mister Spex jumps into positive territory after profit warning,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MISTER-SPEX-SE-114228928/news/Mister-Spex-jumps-into-positive-territory-after-profit-warning-47665072/,MRX,dpa-AFX,"(New: Shares close higher, MWB)
FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - A sales and profit warning from Mister Spex caused the share price to plummet to an almost record low on Thursday. The shares of the Berlin-based online optician fell by more than 8 percent to 2.30 euros in the morning. They were thus only just above the record low of 2.26 euros set at the beginning of the month.
As trading progressed, the shares then benefited from the significantly brighter market sentiment following the publication of strong economic data from the USA. As a result, the shares turned positive and closed 0.80 percent higher at 2.53 euros.
The Berlin-based company had cut its annual targets for net sales and profitability. The company now does not rule out a decline in turnover of up to 6 percent. In the best-case scenario, sales should increase by 3 percent. Previously, the management had forecast low to medium net sales growth. The adjusted operating margin is expected to be between minus 4 percent and plus one percent in 2024. Originally, this figure was expected to be in the low single-digit percentage range.
The shares are now only worth around a tenth of the issue price of 25 euros at which they were allocated to investors at the IPO in summer 2021. From September 2021 to September 2022, the share price slumped from EUR 24 to EUR 2.40 and then trended sideways between this low and EUR 5, most recently with a downward trend.
Analyst Thomas Wissler from MWB Research pointed out that Mister Spex had announced a major transformation and restructuring initiative. This transformation program is aimed at increasing profitability and generating sustainable cash over the next two years.
Secondly, Mister Spex has announced that it will change its key financial performance indicator from adjusted EBITDA to EBIT to increase transparency and provide a clearer insight into its financial performance. According to Wissler, this should help to better measure Mister Spex's progress towards becoming a profitable company./bek/ajx/la/men","[{'Name': 'Dirk Graber', 'Age': '47 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2006-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Dirk Graber', 'Age': '47 year', 'Position': 'Founder', 'Date': '2006-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Irina Zhurba', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '2022-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Stephan Schulz-Gohritz', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2023-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Tobias Krauss', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Chairman', 'Date': '2024-07-03'}, {'Name': 'Nicola Brandolese', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-06-14'}, {'Name': 'Nicola Brandolese', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2021-06-14'}, {'Name': 'Birgit Kretschmer', 'Age': '53 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-06-14'}, {'Name': 'Nicole Srock-Stanley', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2021-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Pietro Luigi Longo', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2021-05-19'}]",Consumer Cyclicals,"{'Company Name': 'Mister Spex SE', 'Address Line 1': 'Hermann Blankenstein Strasse 24', 'Address Line 2': '10249, Berlin', 'Phone Number': '+44 800 472 5457', 'Website': 'http://www.misterspex.de'}",{'United Kingdom'},"{'Germany', 'El Salvador', 'United States'}","{'United Kingdom', 'Germany', 'El Salvador', 'United States'}",Germany,2024-08-15 00:00:00
Standard Bank plans to increase stakes in Nigeria and Angola businesses,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STANDARD-BANK-GROUP-LIMIT-1413410/news/Standard-Bank-plans-to-increase-stakes-in-Nigeria-and-Angola-businesses-47664365/,SBK,Reuters,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Standard Bank,
Africa's biggest lender by assets, is looking to increase stakes
it holds in businesses in Angola and Nigeria, its CEO said on
Thursday.
The Angolan government is planning to sell as much as a 34%
stake in Standard Bank de Angola SA through an initial public
offering, according to a presidential decree, after seizing a
49% stake that was controlled by a former insurance tycoon who
is serving a nine-year prison term.
South Africa-based Standard Bank Group owns the remaining
51% and has the right to buy an additional 24% stake in the
Angolan business.
""We are going through a process where we are putting our
best foot forward and therefore would increase our shareholding
if all goes well,"" CEO Sim Tshabalala told Reuters in an
interview.
""In Nigeria we are again wanting to increase our
shareholding in the business. It's a great business,"" he added,
without saying by how much.
Standard Bank owns 67.55% of Stanbic IBTC,
according to LSEG data.
Standard Bank, with operations in 20 African countries, is
hoping to be at the forefront of growth opportunities unlocked
by energy transition projects in key regions on the continent,
including East Africa.

Indian logistics firm Ecom Express files for $310 million IPO,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/DELHIVERY-LIMITED-138283112/news/Indian-logistics-firm-Ecom-Express-files-for-310-million-IPO-47664306/,DELHIVERY,Reuters,"BENGALURU (Reuters) -     Logistics firm Ecom Express on Thursday filed for an initial public offering (IPO) worth up to 26 billion rupees ($310 million), its draft papers showed.
The IPO will consist of a fresh issue of shares worth up to 12.85 billion rupees while existing investors will offload shares aggregating to 13.16 billion rupees.
The e-commerce logistics firm, which counts Amazon and beauty products retailer Nykaa among its clients, looks to go public at a time when India's IPO space has seen more than 150 companies raise around $5 billion this year as of July-end.
The company, which competes with the likes of Delhivery and Blue Dart, said it intends to use funds from the fresh issue towards setting up of new processing and fulfilment centres, investment in IT equipment and payment of debt.
Among those selling their existing stakes, Partners Group's PG Esmeralda and Warburg Pincus's Eaglebay Investment would sell holdings worth 9.31 billion rupees and 2.11 billion rupees, respectively.
Ecom Express reported a net loss of 2.54 billion rupees for the year ended March 31, 2024, compared with a loss of 4.22 billion rupees, a year earlier.

Aurobindo Explores Options to Take Eugia Pharma Public,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/AUROBINDO-PHARMA-9059028/news/Aurobindo-Explores-Options-to-Take-Eugia-Pharma-Public-47662048/,AUROPHARMA,S&P Capital IQ,"Aurobindo Pharma Limited (NSEI:AUROPHARMA) is in talks with bankers to revive a planned strategic stake sale in its injectable unit Eugia Pharma Specialities Limited, including through a potential initial public offering (IPO), said chief financial officer Santhanam Subramanian. ?The bankers have reached out, we are exploring all options,? Subramanian told ET in an interview.
?At this point of time, we may not look into private equity because it is time consuming. We (are) looking into other options mainly IPO,? he said.
Subramanian added bankers will weigh Eugia's business including potential impact of regulatory inspections by USFDA at the unit's facilities before advising the best way forward. Eugia recorded a revenue of $541 million (INR 44.80 billion) in FY24, a 31% growth, making it the largest Indian injectable drugmaker in the US market. Eugia is aiming for $600 million revenue this fiscal.
The US alone contributed about 73% of the revenue from injectable and specialty sales. Aurobindo's consolidated revenue stood at INR 290.00 billion in FY24. Aurobindo was earlier in talks with PE investors like Blackstone and Baring Asia for a strategic stake sale, but a deal didn't materialise over valuation mismatch.
ET reported in August 2023, citing sources, that Aurobindo is trying its luck for the second time, by appointing investment bank Moelis to run the strategic sale process. As per the report, Aurobindo promoters Ramprasad Reddy and his family have lowered valuation of the injectable business to $2 billion - $2.5 billion from $3 billion previously.","[{'Name': 'Kambam Nithyananda Reddy', 'Age': '66 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2021-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Kambam Nithyananda Reddy', 'Age': '66 year', 'Position': 'Founder', 'Date': '1986-12-25'}, {'Name': 'Santhanam Subramanian', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2014-06-30'}, {'Name': 'B.

Bengzon, one of incumbent directors, as member of the Executive Committee vice Ms. Mariana Zobel de Ayala.
The Board thanked Ms. Mills for her key role in leading AREIT through its IPO in August 2020 amidst challenging circumstances during the pandemic, effectively restructuring a single property company into the first, largest, and most diversified Philippine REIT today.

Revenues consistently grew since the IPO and consequently, dividends doubled, delivering a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 74% to date since the IPO. During her tenure, AREIT garnered seven international awards, including Asia Money's Most Outstanding IPO, Finance Asia's Deal of the Year, and The Asset's Best IPO.

"Mindbody ClassPass to go public in 12-18 months, CEO says",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/THE-GOLDMAN-SACHS-GROUP-I-12831/news/Mindbody-ClassPass-to-go-public-in-12-18-months-CEO-says-47649148/,GS,Reuters,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - Mindbody ClassPass is aiming to go
public in the next 12-18 months and has retained Goldman Sachs
as its lead banker, the CEO of the fitness and wellness
marketplace told Reuters in an interview.
California-based Mindbody, which went public in 2015, was
taken private by Vista Equity Partners for $1.9 billion in 2019.
In 2021, it acquired ClassPass, a subscription-based workout
platform, valuing the combined entity at about $3 billion then.
""We are a story of two different businesses under one
umbrella, both of which are growing, both of which are
profitable, setting us up for an eventual IPO,"" CEO Fritz Lanman
said.
""We have Goldman ... but we haven't chosen the second and
third leads yet,"" he added.
In its last funding round in 2021, the company raised $500
million through a strategic convertible debt investment led by
Sixth Street.
Together now known as Mindbody ClassPass, the company is
expecting to achieve a 20% growth in revenue for 2024 touching
around $500 million, Lanman said, adding that ClassPass is 65%
bigger than pre-Covid.
The company is seeing a strong recovery post-pandemic with
increased demand for yoga and in-person fitness sessions.
Moreover, ClassPass application is leveraging artificial
intelligence to help customers book salon and spa sessions.
Lanman said the company is keeping an eye on how IPOs have
been performing, with the cash from the offering to be mainly
for shareholder liquidity and mergers and acquisitions.
Vista Equity is the biggest shareholder of the business
along with all ClassPass venture capitalists including L
Catterton, Temasek, General Catalyst and Thrive Capital
continuing to be stakeholders as the business is compounding
really fast for them, he added.

Germany's Douglas posts higher Q3 core profit,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/DOUGLAS-AG-167166231/news/Germany-s-Douglas-posts-higher-Q3-core-profit-47644385/,DOU,Reuters,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - German perfume and cosmetics retailer
Douglas reported higher core profit for its fiscal
third quarter on Wednesday, supported by its omnichannel
business model focused on premium beauty.
""Our continued growth clearly confirms that our strategic
focus on premium beauty strongly resonates with our customers,""
Chief Executive Officer Sander van der Laan said in a statement.
Its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) rose 5.6% to 162.9 million euros ($179
million) in the three months through June, compared to 154.3
million a year earlier.
That corresponded to a margin of 16.7%, slightly down from
16.9% in the same period last year.
The Düsseldorf-based company also confirmed the
pre-announced sales growth of 7.3% to 977.1 million euros in the
third quarter, and reiterated its financial targets for the full
year.
Douglas, which sells beauty products from brands like Chanel
and Dior, in July raised its annual sales growth target to 8.5%,
from around 7% previously, while reiterating its adjusted EBITDA
margin at 18.5% against the 17.7% reported last year.
The company also said it had closed the sale of its
struggling online pharmacy business Disapo to Amsterdam-based
online prescription operator MYA Health at the end of July, as
expected.

"Financing conditions pass global selloff test, so far",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/THE-GOLDMAN-SACHS-GROUP-I-12831/news/Financing-conditions-pass-global-selloff-test-so-far-47643205/,GS,Reuters,"* Global financial conditions holding up after stocks
turmoil
* Goldman Sachs gauge shows conditions historically loose
* Carry trade unwind impact on liquidity a risk to watch
-analysts
Aug 14 (Reuters) - A tumultuous sell-off in financial
markets this month has barely scathed global financing
conditions, but the risk of further volatility means borrowers
are not yet out of the woods.
Equity and corporate debt markets have clawed back some of
their losses sparked earlier in August by U.S. recession fears
and the unwinding of a popular yen carry trade.
They remain markedly weaker than a month ago, however, with
the S&P 500 broad U.S. stock index still 5% below July's
peak after an initial plunge of nearly 10%. European stocks have
taken a similar hit.
Higher and lower-rated corporate bonds
have meanwhile given up much of a decline this year in the risk
premium they pay over government bonds.
But financing conditions - the ease with which borrowers can
obtain funding - have not tightened enough, even at the height
of the selloff, to spark worries about a sharper economic
slowdown that could hasten central bank interest rate cuts.
""We just haven't seen big enough moves to materially change
financing conditions for corporates or households,"" said Chris
Jeffrey, head of macro strategy at Legal & General Investment
Management.
Indeed, a closely-watched gauge of U.S. financial conditions
compiled by Goldman Sachs shows that while they have tightened
sharply since mid-July, conditions remain loose historically and
more accommodative than in much of last year.
Global stocks, for example, are still up nearly 10% this
year and credit spreads are lower than in 2023.
Goldman estimates that every potential further 10% sell-off
in equities would reduce U.S. economic growth over the next year
by just under half a percentage point, while associated moves in
other markets if equities slumped could imply a total hit of
just under a percentage point.
So with U.S. growth still over 2%, it would take a much
bigger drop in equity markets to cause significant economic pain
that ripples out globally.
RATE CUTS
With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to start cutting rates
soon and other central banks already doing so, the key takeaway
from the recent market ructions is a fall in borrowing costs.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are down more than 50 basis
points since the start of July, while yields on UK and German
government bonds have fallen over 30 bps apiece as investors bet
on steeper rate cuts.
That bodes well for borrowers. U.S. investment-grade
corporate bond yields have also dropped 50 bps since the start
of July.
Highly-rated companies raised $45 billion from U.S. bond
sales last week, according to LSEG's IFR - at the high end of
analyst expectations and a sign of confidence amid the selloff.
There were also more bond sales in Europe than a year ago,
while the U.S. market made a strong start to this week.
""It doesn't seem like access to credit is really a problem
right now,"" said Idanna Appio, portfolio manager at First Eagle
Investment Management.
""Indeed, lower Treasury yields are opening up a window for
companies to come to market,"" Appio, a former Fed economist,
said.
Even junk bond yields are down 37 bps since the start of
July, meaning conditions have become more favourable for
lower-rated companies, which raised $7.2 billion from bond sales
in the U.S. last week.
WEAK POCKETS?
Expectations that volatility will remain elevated
nevertheless create uncertainty for borrowers.
The VIX index, Wall St's ""fear gauge"", dropped below 20
points this week to its lowest this month, but remains much
higher than its January-July average.
And with August usually quiet for initial public offerings,
the impact on equity fundraising - which typically takes a hit
when volatility rises - has yet to be seen.
Dealmakers said they were sanguine as long as markets remain
calm, but mindful of uncertainty ahead.
Javier Rodriguez, global head of value creation at KPMG, did
not rule out IPO deals in the pipeline slowing or stopping.
""There is no certainty on (what) the final picture might
look like, but potentially a cooled-down market when compared to
the last 18 months,"" he said.
In credit markets, while money flowed into investment-grade
bonds last week, junk bonds saw outflows, according to BofA,
signalling caution around weaker borrowers.
With high-yield bond sales globally having notched their
highest first half of the year since 2021, according to LSEG,
outflows are unlikely to alarm borrowers yet.
But some were sizeable. Outflows from U.S. leveraged loans,
whose investors take a hit when interest rates fall, were the
largest since the height of the COVID pandemic in March 2020,
according to JPMorgan.
The impact of the carry trade unwind itself on liquidity
conditions also remains a risk to watch.
""Once carry trades plunge, funds flee countries and assets
where they finance economic activity,"" said BCA Research's chief
European strategist Mathieu Savary. ""As a result, liquidity
conditions tighten where growth is generated, which harms global
economic activity.""

California allows Chinese robotaxi firm WeRide to test with passengers,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GENERAL-MOTORS-COMPANY-6873535/news/California-allows-Chinese-robotaxi-firm-WeRide-to-test-with-passengers-47641759/,GM,Reuters,"Aug 13 (Reuters) - China-based autonomous driving
startup WeRide has received approval from California to test its
driverless vehicles with passengers, according to a permit from
the state's utility regulator.
The move comes as the company seeks a valuation of as much
as $5 billion from its New York IPO even as the U.S. is set to
ban vehicles with China-developed systems, according to people
briefed on the matter.
The permit from the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) - issued earlier this month for three years -
allows WeRide to ferry passengers in test vehicles with a driver
and without one. WeRide will not be allowed to offer rides to
the general public and cannot charge any fares.
WeRide has 12 active vehicles and will operate in San
Jose and nearby areas, CPUC said in a statement to Reuters.
Developing and commercializing robotaxis in the U.S. has
been tougher than expected with regulatory hurdles, opposition
from city agencies and public outrage.
Alphabet's Waymo, which has about 700 vehicles
in its fleet, is the only U.S. firm operating uncrewed robotaxis
that collect fares.
General Motors' Cruise restarted testing with safety
drivers in April after one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian last
year.
WeRide, founded in 2017, first received permits from
California to test its vehicles without passengers in 2021. The
company, which also makes autonomous vans, buses and street
sweepers, has driverless permits in Singapore and the United
Arab Emirates.
WeRide did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests
for further details.

The unit may see as much as $2 billion a sale.
Deliberations about a possible sale are ongoing and XPO may decide to keep the business, according to the report. A potential sale comes after XPO announced in December 2022 that it ended plans to divest its European business, citing weakened capital markets in Europe.

XPO said it expected to divest its European business through either a sale or a listing on a European stock exchange.","[{'Name': 'Mario Harik', 'Age': '43 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}, {'Name': 'Kyle Wismans', 'Age': '40 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2023-08-10'}, {'Name': 'Wendy Cassity', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2023-02-28'}, {'Name': 'Wendy Cassity', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2023-02-28'}, {'Name': 'David Bates', 'Age': '59 year', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '2023-04-20'}, {'Name': 'Anthony Hoereth', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Sales & Marketing', 'Date': '2008-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Diana Brown', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Sales & Marketing', 'Date': '2019-01-31'}, {'Name': 'Christopher Brown', 'Age': '50 year', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '2022-02-27'}, {'Name': 'Swati Sharma', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Treasurer', 'Date': '2021-11-17'}, {'Name': 'Monica Thurman', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2017-01-31'}, {'Name': 'Jay Silberkleit', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 'Date': '2021-04-30'}, {'Name': 'Bradley Jacobs', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'Chairman', 'Date': '2011-09-01'}, {'Name': 'Allison Landry', 'Age': '45 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-08-01'}, {'Name': 'Allison Landry', 'Age': '45 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Allison Landry', 'Age': '45 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Allison Landry', 'Age': '45 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2024-06-05'}, {'Name': 'Allison Landry', 'Age': '45 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2024-06-05'}, {'Name': 'Johnny Taylor', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-28'}, {'Name': 'Johnny Taylor', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Johnny Taylor', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Johnny Taylor', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Johnny Taylor', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-01'}, {'Name': 'Michael Jesselson', 'Age': '72 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2016-03-19'}, {'Name': 'Michael Jesselson', 'Age': '72 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Michael Jesselson', 'Age': '72 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Michael Jesselson', 'Age': '72 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2024-06-11'}, {'Name': 'Michael Jesselson', 'Age': '72 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2024-06-11'}, {'Name': 'Irene Moshouris', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2023-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Irene Moshouris', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}, {'Name': 'Irene Moshouris', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}, {'Name': 'Irene Moshouris', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}, {'Name': 'Bella Allaire', 'Age': '70 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}, {'Name': 'Bella Allaire', 'Age': '70 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}, {'Name': 'John Frye', 'Age': '76 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-03-07'}, {'Name': 'John Frye', 'Age': '76 year', 'Position': 'Independent Dir/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-03-07'}, {'Name': 'Mario Harik', 'Age': '43 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2022-10-31'}]",Industrials,"{'Company Name': 'XPO, Inc.', 'Address Line 1': 'Five American Lane', 'Address Line 2': '06831, Greenwich', 'Phone Number': '+855 976 6951', 'Website': 'http://www.xpo.com'}",{'Cambodia'},{'Unknown'},{'Cambodia'},Cambodia,2024-08-13 00:00:00

Japan's SMBC has raised stake in Jefferies Financial to nearly 11%,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SUMITOMO-MITSUI-FINANCIAL-6496212/news/Japan-s-SMBC-has-raised-stake-in-Jefferies-Financial-to-nearly-11-47624473/,8316,Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -     Jefferies Financial Group said on Monday that Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) has more than doubled its stake in the U.S. investment bank to 10.9%, deepening an alliance dating back to 2021.
As part of the expanded ties, Toru Nakashima, the CEO of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, SMBC's parent, joined Jefferies' board of directors on Monday, the U.S. bank said in a statement.
SMBC plans to increase its ownership of Jefferies to as much as 15%, as flagged last year.
Under the partnership, Jefferies dealmakers take the lead on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and equity capital markets (ECM), while SMBC bankers focus on corporate lending and investment-grade debt issuance.
""There's an active and broad pipeline of M&A, ECM and leveraged financing activities involving SMBC and Jefferies working together,"" Jefferies President Brian Friedman told Reuters. ""There's been a good number of completed deals and more in the pipeline.""
SMBC's hefty balance sheet and its international client roster have boosted Jefferies' involvement in overseas deals.
""In the few short years that our strategic alliance has existed, it has already borne meaningful opportunities,"" Nakashima said in the statement.

Webtoon Entertainment shares sank Friday, the day after the online-comic platform posted quarterly revenue below market expectations.
Shares of the Los Angeles company were down 36% to $13.13 Friday. This is down 37% from the $21 it priced shares in the company's public debut on Nasdaq in late June.
The company backed by South Korean internet giant Naver on Thursday posted second-quarter revenue of $321 million. This was up from $320.7 million a year earlier, but well below the $340.8 million forecast by analysts polled by FactSet. Webtoon reported a quarterly net loss $76.6 million, or 70 cents, also below market forcasts for 72 cents.
The company said its quarterly loss was driven by one-time IPO costs and stock-based compensation expenses. Webtoon also said significant exposure to weaker foreign currencies, including the South Korean won and the Japanese yen, hit its revenue.
For the third quarter, Webtoon said it expects revenue of $332 million to $338 million, while analysts polled by FactSet are looking for revenue of $351 million.

Astroscale said its Japan unit would sign the five-year contract with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on Tuesday.
The agreement will see the startup remove the upper stage of JAXA's H-IIA rocket, which was launched in 2009 and has been in orbit about 600 km (373 miles) above the earth's surface.
Astroscale will develop a new spacecraft named ADRAS-J2 that will equip robotic arm technologies to capture the target debris by March 2029, the company said in a statement.
Debris is increasingly becoming a risk for space missions, as the number of satellites in orbit has risen sharply.
A Chinese rocket stage that broke apart in space earlier this month created more than 700 pieces of debris in the latest addition to the hazardous collision risks.

Suncorp Annual Profit Rises 12% on Positive Investment Returns,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SUNCORP-GROUP-LIMITED-6491453/news/Suncorp-Annual-Profit-Rises-12-on-Positive-Investment-Returns-47679824/,SUN,Dow Jones,"By Alice Uribe
SYDNEY--Suncorp Group said its annual profit rose by 12%, driven by positive investment returns and natural hazard costs coming in below allowances.
The Australian general insurer said Monday that net profit rose to 1.20 billion Australian dollars (US$800 million) in the 12 months through June.
This came in under a consensus estimate of A$1.29 billion in a FactSet-compiled poll of analysts.
Suncorp's full-year revenue was A$15.03 billion, up 5.0% on year. Cash earnings, a measure tracked by analysts that excludes certain costs and one-time items, rose by 17% to A$1.37 billion.
The total cost of natural hazard events for fiscal 2024 was A$1.24 billion, which was A$125 million below the group's allowance. Suncorp managed 12 separate weather events in Australia.
Higher net investment income of A$661 million, up from A$451 million the previous year, was driven by a strong underlying yield on the interest-earning portfolio and stronger equity markets, said Suncorp.
Directors of the company declared a final dividend of 44 Australian cents a share, up from 27 cents a share a year earlier.
Suncorp said it now expects gross written premium in the mid to high single digits, with an underlying insurance trading ratio target toward the top of a 10-12% range.

billionaire founder and chairman of Endeavor Energy Resources,
has died aged 86, the company disclosed on Friday, after a
prolonged battle with cancer.
Stephens died early on Friday morning, a source familiar
with the matter said.
Known for a relentless work ethic and frugal nature, he had
continued to work while under medical care and relied on friends
to fly him in a private jet to cancer treatments in Houston.
His work ethic was shaped by tough years in the 1980s and
1990s when he struggled to get Endeavor off the ground, sources
said. The wildcatter launched Endeavor in 1979 and grew it into
one of the largest closely held U.S. oil and gas firms by buying
tough-to-drill wells that oil majors snubbed.
Stephens in February agreed to sell his Midland, Texas-based
company for $26 billion to local rival Diamondback Energy
. He had rebuffed many offers for the business over the
years. The deal is expected to close later this year.
Stephens' daughter, Lyndal Greth, becomes chairman of
Endeavor's board of managers, the company said on Friday. Greth
was previously vice chairman.
Born in 1938, Stephens grew up on a farm in DeLeon, Texas,
where his family grew peanuts and fruits. He studied engineering
and went to work for Humble Oil & Refining, a predecessor to
Exxon Mobil, according to a profile on the University of
Texas' engineering school website.
Stephens drilled his first well in 1979 in Midland county,
Texas. He would pick up leaseholds for acreage that oil majors
found too expensive to drill and would lower production costs by
handling most of the operations. He created and used his own
fracking, construction and trucking companies.
Stephens was well known in Midland, Texas, the heart of the
U.S. shale business, and for bringing his dog to his office
regularly. He named one of his companies Big Dog Drilling.
""He was stubborn and persistent. And in the right place at
the right time,"" said Javaid Anwar, a Texas businessman who
first met Stephens 1976 while working at a bank in Midland.
The two became friends in the years that followed through
numerous fishing trips and business deals.
""He was a fish hog,"" joked Anwar, recounting how Stephens
used to take up his coveted turns to reel in catch on their
fishing trips.
Anwar helped fly Stephens to Houston on his private jet for
cancer treatments over the past year, which gave the two the
opportunity to look back at old memories from their time in the
oil business.
""He was one of the pioneers of horizontal drilling that
helped the Permian come to produce nearly 6.5 million barrels of
oil per day, roughly half of the U.S. total,"" Anwar said.

International's proposed $4-billion takeover of retailer
Mattress Firm is intended to ""eliminate future competition"",
according to a document unsealed by a Texas judge.
A May 2022 presentation to the board by the company's CEO
stated that buying Mattress Firm would enable Tempur Sealy to
""eliminate future competition"" and ""block future competition"",
the papers showed. The presentation did not name the executive.
Scott Thompson has been Tempur Sealy CEO since 2015, after
shareholders ousted Mark Sarvary.
The document, unsealed on Wednesday, is among submissions by
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which sued last month to
block the cash-and-stock deal announced in May 2023.
The FTC expressed concerns about the deal's impact on
competition, higher prices for consumers and potential job
losses for manufacturing workers.
The two companies and the FTC did not immediately respond to
Reuters requests for comment.
Through the deal, Tempur Sealy seeks to add Mattress Firm's
2,300-plus brick-and-mortar stores. The combined company will
have about 3,000 stores globally, if the deal goes through.

"Boeing, Lockheed Martin in talks to sell rocket-launch firm ULA to Sierra Space",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BOEING-4816/news/Boeing-Lockheed-Martin-in-talks-to-sell-rocket-launch-firm-ULA-to-Sierra-Space-47675243/,BA,Reuters,"WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Boeing and
Lockheed Martin are in talks to sell their
rocket-launching joint venture United Launch Alliance to Sierra
Space, two people familiar with the discussions said.
A deal could value ULA at around $2 billion to $3 billion,
the sources said.
A deal to sell ULA, a major provider of launch services to
the U.S. government and a top rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX, would
mark a significant shift in the U.S. space launch industry as
ULA separates from two of the largest defense contractors to a
smaller, privately held firm.
The potential sale comes after years of speculation about
ULA's future and failed attempts to divest the joint venture
over the past decade. In 2019, Boeing and Lockheed Martin
reportedly explored selling ULA but couldn't agree on terms with
potential buyers.
The negotiations could end without a deal, the sources said.
ULA referred Reuters to Boeing and Lockheed for comment. The
two companies said they do not comment on market speculation.
Sierra did not immediately return a request for comment.
Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Cerberus Capital Management had
placed bids in early 2023 for the company, according to people
familiar with the negotiations. Rocket Lab had also expressed
interest, two people said. None of those discussions led to a
deal. Rocket Lab could not be immediately reached.
A potential deal would be an ambitious move for Sierra
Space, spun off from Sierra Nevada Corp in 2021 to focus on
bringing to market its long-delayed Dream Chaser spaceplane and
building a private space station habitat with Blue Origin.
Sierra Space has weighed a public offering.
A potential deal could accelerate deployment of its
crewed spaceflight business, analysts said. A ULA acquisition,
they said, would give the company in-house access to launch
vehicles that could send its spaceplane and space-station
components into Earth's orbit, rather than spending hundreds of
millions of dollars for those launches as a customer.
For Boeing, the potential sale of ULA represents a
strategic move under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took the helm in
August. A deal would allow Boeing to concentrate on its core
aerospace and defense businesses while reaping some cash from
ULA's sale.
ULA was formed in 2006 as a consolidation of Boeing's
and Lockheed's dueling rocket businesses, ending years of
competition between the two and cementing their grip on
government launch services - the primary mission of the joint
venture's founding charter.
The rise of SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9, which
galvanized a satellite industry seeking cheaper access to space,
forced ULA to phase out its decades-old Atlas and Delta rockets
for its new, cheaper Vulcan rocket that made its debut launch in
2023.
But ULA has faced challenges in scaling Vulcan
production and upping its launch rate to meet commercial demand
and fulfill contract obligations with the Space Force, which in
2021 picked Vulcan for a sizable chunk of national security
missions alongside SpaceX's Falcon fleet.
A sale of ULA would unshackle the company from Boeing
and Lockheed, whose boards have long resisted ideas from ULA to
expand the business beyond rockets and into new competitive
markets such as lunar habitats or maneuverable spacecraft,

"Boeing, Lockheed Martin in talks to sell ULA to Sierra Space",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BOEING-4816/news/Boeing-Lockheed-Martin-in-talks-to-sell-ULA-to-Sierra-Space-47675101/,BA,Reuters,"WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Boeing and
Lockheed Martin are in talks to sell their
rocket-launching joint venture United Launch Alliance to Sierra
Space, two people familiar with the discussions said.
A deal to sell ULA, a major provider of launch services to
the U.S. government and a top rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX, would
mark a significant shift in the U.S. space launch industry as
ULA separates from two of the largest defense contractors to a
smaller, privately held firm.
The potential sale comes after years of speculation about
ULA's future and failed attempts to divest the joint venture
over the past decade. In 2019, Boeing and Lockheed Martin
reportedly explored selling ULA but couldn't agree on terms with
potential buyers.
The negotiations could end without a deal, the sources said.
ULA referred Reuters to Boeing and Lockheed for comment. The
two companies said they do not comment on market speculation.
Sierra did not immediately return a request for comment.

"Appfire's owners explore sale of stake in collaboration software maker, sources say",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/Appfire-s-owners-explore-sale-of-stake-in-collaboration-software-maker-sources-say-47674900/,JPM,Reuters,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investment firms TA
Associates and Silversmith Capital Partners are exploring
options including the sale of a stake in Appfire, in a deal that
could value the collaboration software maker they own at more
than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
TA and Silversmith have tapped investment bankers at
JPMorgan Chase and Lazard as they weigh selling
up to a 60% stake in Appfire, the sources said, adding that the
owners could roll over a portion of their stakes as part of a
potential deal.
The sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions are
confidential, said potential buyers of the stake include other
private-equity firms.
Appfire is hoping to command a valuation equivalent to more
than 20 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of roughly $100 million, the sources said. The
company is expected to generate close to $300 million in revenue
for 2024, the sources said, adding it is growing revenues by 30%
annually.
Silversmith, JPMorgan, and Lazard declined to comment. TA
Associates and Appfire did not respond to requests for comment.
Burlington, Massachusetts-based Appfire provides workflow
collaboration software to customers, including German shoe and
sports apparel giant Adidas, e-signature company
Docusign, and NASA.
Its software applications are sold through platforms of
large technology corporations including Microsoft,
Salesforce, Atlassian, and monday.com.
Smartsheet, a U.S. maker of workplace collaboration
software with a market value of $6.6 billion, has tapped
investment bankers after attracting acquisition interest from
buyout firms, Reuters reported in July.
TA picked up a significant stake in Appfire in 2021, a year
after Silversmith made a $49-million investment in the company.

"Texas oil billionaire, wildcatter Autry Stephens dies at 86",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EXXON-MOBIL-CORPORATION-4822/news/Texas-oil-billionaire-wildcatter-Autry-Stephens-dies-at-86-47674820/,XOM,Reuters,"HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Autry Stephens, the
billionaire founder and chairman of Endeavor Energy Resources,
died aged 86, the company disclosed on Friday, after a prolonged
battle with cancer.
Known for a relentless work ethic and frugal nature, he
continued to work while under medical care and relied on friends
to fly him in a private jet to cancer treatments in Houston.
His work ethic was shaped by tough years in the 1980s and
1990s when he struggled to get Endeavor off the ground, sources
said. The wildcatter launched Endeavor in 1979 and grew it into
one of the largest closely held U.S. oil and gas firms by buying
tough-to-drill wells that oil majors snubbed.
Stephens in February agreed to sell his Midland, Texas-based
company for $26 billion to a local rival, Diamondback Energy
. He had rebuffed many offers for the business over the
years. The deal is expected to close later this year.
Stephens' daughter Lyndal Greth becomes chairman of
Endeavor's board of managers, the company said on Friday. Greth
was previously vice chairman.
Born in 1938, Stephens grew up on a farm in DeLeon, Texas,
where his family grew peanuts and fruits. He studied engineering
and went to work for Humble Oil & Refining, a predecessor to
Exxon Mobil, according to a profile on the University of
Texas' engineering school website.
Stephens drilled his first well in 1979 in Midland county,
Texas. He would pick up leaseholds for acreage that oil majors
found too expensive to drill and would lower production costs by
handling most of the operations. He created and used his own
fracking, construction and trucking companies.
Stephens was well known in Midland, Texas, the heart of the
U.S. shale business, and for bringing his dog to his office
regularly. He named one of his companies Big Dog Drilling.

Brazilian pet product retailer Petz shares soar on Cobasi merger deal,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PET-CENTER-COMERCIO-E-PAR-119084123/news/Brazilian-pet-product-retailer-Petz-shares-soar-on-Cobasi-merger-deal-47673997/,PETZ3,Reuters,"SAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Brazil's Petz
soared on Friday after the company formalized a deal
to merge with rival Cobasi, creating the country's largest pet
products retailer.
An agreement on the tie-up had initially been announced in
April, when the two companies signed a memorandum of
understanding on the merger which has now been confirmed.
Sao Paulo-traded shares of Petz climbed as much as 29.5% on
the announcement, making it the top gainer by midday on
benchmark stock index Bovespa, which was near flat.
""We believe there was skepticism in the market if the deal
would indeed materialize,"" JPMorgan analysts led by Nicolas
Larrain said, dubbing the transaction positive although noting
that some terms were ""revised down"".
Under the agreement, Petz will become a subsidiary of Cobasi
and its shareholders will get 52.6% of the combined company,
which will be listed on the Sao Paulo stock exchange's ""Novo
Mercado"" segment with stricter governance rules.
Petz shareholders will also receive 400 million reais ($73
million) in cash, including 130 million that will be distributed
as extraordinary dividends before the transaction is completed,
the company said in a securities filing.
""This compares to an initially announced 450 million reais,""
JPMorgan flagged.
The new company is estimated to have annual gross revenue of
7 billion reais from 494 stores in more than 140 cities. The
merger still requires approval from Brazil's antitrust watchdog,
which the companies expect will come in 2025.
Annual synergies were forecast to reach between 220 million
and 330 million reais in additional core earnings (EBITDA), Petz
and Cobasi said.
The new company will have nine board members, five of them
appointed by Cobasi's controllers and four by Petz's reference
shareholder Sergio Zimmerman, who will serve as chairman. Cobasi
founder Paulo Nassar will be appointed as chief executive.

"Repligen in bid for reagent vendor Maravai, sources say",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/REPLIGEN-CORPORATION-10664/news/Repligen-in-bid-for-reagent-vendor-Maravai-sources-say-47673985/,RGEN,Reuters,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - Repligen, a provider of drug
manufacturing equipment, has approached Maravai LifeSciences
Holdings, a vaccine capping reagent vendor that has a
market value of $2.2 billion, with an acquisition offer, people
familiar with the matter said on Friday.
There is no certainty that Maravai will agree to a deal with
Repligen, the sources said. Repligen is also deliberating
whether it should divest some of Maravai's divisions if it
succeeds in acquiring the company, one of the sources added.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is
confidential. Spokespeople for Repligen and Maravai did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.
Maravai has become a takeover target after it lost nearly
80% of its value from its August 2021 peak, as it struggled to
diversify beyond COVID-19 vaccines after the pandemic subsided.

Pricol Seeks Inorganic Growth,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PRICOL-LIMITED-34166373/news/Pricol-Seeks-Inorganic-Growth-47676088/,PRICOLLTD,S&P Capital IQ,"Pricol Limited (NSEI:PRICOLLTD) is looking for inorganic growth. The company is actively pursuing inorganic growth and has shortlisted a few assets for potential acquisition. Vikram Mohan, Managing Director of the company, had indicated that Pricol was exploring inorganic growth opportunities to diversify its product portfolio and expand into new geographies to enhance its global footprint.
?Regarding inorganic opportunities, we?ve identified a few assets that we?re currently evaluating and negotiating with the respective parties. As these discussions are still under NDA, we?re unable to share further details. However, we anticipate providing more concrete guidance by next quarter,?
Siddharth Manoharan ? Director of Strategy of Pricol said during the company?s Q1FY25 earnings call. Pricol?s operations are divided into two verticals ?
Driver Information and Connected Vehicle Solutions (DICVS) and Actuation, Control, and Fluid Management Systems (ACFMS). DICVS accounts for 70% of the revenue, with the remainder coming from ACFMS. In terms of revenue distribution, approximately 65% comes from the two-wheeler segment, about 15% from commercial vehicles, 10% from passenger vehicles, and the rest from tractors and off-highway vehicles. PM Ganesh, CEO & Executive Director of Pricol, highlighted that the company has consistently outperformed the market quarter after quarter over the past three years, driven by growing opportunities for value addition in its products.
He expressed confidence that this trend will continue, as Pricol is continuously gaining market share with new project launches each quarter. He also noted the ongoing growth in the four-wheeler segment, particularly in the Indian market. Since re-entering the personal passenger vehicle segment in 2020, Pricol has seen steady growth and expects this momentum to continue.
It is a major supplier to Tata Motors for personal passenger vehicles and is collaborating with several other Indian OEMs in this segment. Ganesh emphasised that Pricol has a robust order book for the next two years with confirmed business from various customers and is making significant progress in new product development. Discussing new products, Ganesh mentioned that the e-cockpit, targeting passenger and commercial vehicle segments, is undergoing rigorous testing at Pricol?s facilities.
Prototype samples have been provided to customers for validation, and both testing and validation are progressing well. The disc brake is also in a similar stage, with intensive testing underway and vehicle-level testing by customers. Pricol anticipates moving into SOP for both products within the next 12 to 18 months.","[{'Name': 'P. M.

B. Riley co-CEO offers to acquire investment bank,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/B-RILEY-FINANCIAL-INC-23041121/news/B-Riley-co-CEO-offers-to-acquire-investment-bank-47672550/,RILY,Reuters,"(Reuters) -     B. Riley Financial's co-CEO Bryant Riley has proposed to buy the investment bank, he disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday.
The offer of $7 per share held represents a premium of 39% to the stock's last close. The bank's shares rose 18.5% before the bell.
The stock has plunged 70% so far this week, underscoring the challenges the Los Angeles-based bank is facing, particularly concerning its investment in Franchise Group (FRG), the parent company of Vitamin Shoppe.
Riley is the co-founder and the largest shareholder of the investment bank. He said he would not proceed with the transaction unless he gets approval from a special committee of independent directors of the bank's board.
""The current public company paradigm requires us to focus on short-term objectives and allocate unnecessary attention and time on constituencies who are not aligned with the owners of the business,"" Riley said in a letter.
On Monday, shares tumbled 52% after B. Riley warned of a loss of between $435 million and $475 million for the quarter ended June, a significant drop from the profit of $44 million reported a year earlier.
The bank also delayed its quarterly report and warned of a markdown of $330 million to $370 million in the period related to its investment in FRG, a deal under scrutiny by both its shareholders and regulators.

Harland & Wolff revamps board as it looks for a future,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/RIVERSTONE-CREDIT-OPPORTU-58981518/news/Harland-Wolff-revamps-board-as-it-looks-for-a-future-47672403/,RCOI,Alliance News,"Harland & Wolff Group Holdings PLC - London-based shipping yard operator - Russell Downs joins board on Monday as interim executive chair. Downs is a former partner at accountants PwC LLP. He also is the founder of Armada Advisers LLP, which advises on company restructurings. Alan Fort also joins board as a non-executive director on Monday, while Malcolm Groat, Jonathon Band and Katya Zotova all resign as non-executive directors on Tuesday.
The wholesale changes to the board come after Harland & Wolff appoints Rothschild & Co as financial advisor to assess the company's strategic options. The debt-burdened company says it wants to find a way to maximise value for stakeholders while also preserving its core shipyard operations in Belfast, Appledore, Methil and Arnish. In the meantime, it cannot finalise its 2023 accounts on a going concern basis, and therefore its shares will remain suspended from trading in London. Among its creditors is London-listed Riverstone Credit Opportunities Income PLC.
Earlier this month, Harland & Wolff disclosed that the government of the Falkland Islands had decided to end contractual negotiations with Harland for a port replacement project, despite Harland earlier this year having been identified as the preferred bidder for the marine-side work.

"Steel Works Council to Thyssen boss - ""Crowbar method"" must end",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/THYSSENKRUPP-AG-436698/news/Steel-Works-Council-to-Thyssen-boss-Crowbar-method-must-end-47671828/,TKA,Reuters,"In the conflict over the future of thyssenkrupp's steel subsidiary, the Works Council has urged Group CEO Miguel Lopez to bring objectivity to the debate.
""The future of Germany's largest steel producer is at stake, the future of tens of thousands of jobs in the entire region and secure prospects for over 27,000 families are at stake,"" appealed Tekin Nasikkol, Head of the General Works Council of the steel subsidiary, to Lopez on Friday. ""Mr. Lopez must immediately stop publicly damaging the Steel Executive Board and continuing to exert pressure,"" he demanded: ""Steel expertise lies in Duisburg and not in Essen."" Thyssenkrupp's corporate headquarters are located in Essen, while the steel subsidiary is based in Duisburg. The corporate headquarters ""no longer act in a fact-oriented manner and wants to get rid of the steel as cheaply as possible"". Lopez must face up to a ""constructive discussion"".
At its last meeting, the Supervisory Board of the steel subsidiary, on which Lopez also sits, failed to reach an agreement on the financial requirements of Steel Europe. According to Sigmar Gabriel, Chairman of the Steel Supervisory Board, the Steel Board sees a need for additional financing of 1.3 billion euros over and above the aid promised to date. An expert opinion should provide clarity. However, it could take until the end of the year before this is available.
Lopez, for his part, had targeted the Steel Executive Board, headed by Steel CEO Bernhard Osburg, in a statement. ""What we need now is a sober, realistic view of the future without hopeful values and without whitewashing,"" the manager demanded. The Management Board of Steel Europe must finally present a sustainable, solid and financially viable business plan for the realignment of the steel division. The financing requirements of Steel Europe for the next 24 months will be secured by Thyssenkrupp AG. Lopez is aiming for a 50:50 joint venture for the steel business with the energy holding company of Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. The latter already holds 20 percent of the shares. He attended the meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Nasikkol lamented that the uncertainty among the workforce was growing daily: ""Lopez's crowbar method is wrong and dangerous,"" explained the General Works Council Chairman. A ""responsible and objective debate"" is no longer being conducted by the Group headquarters. However, there is far too much at stake.

"Inspired reports ""robust"" first half; consideration payments to end",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/INSPIRED-PLC-9522847/news/Inspired-reports-robust-first-half-consideration-payments-to-end-47671485/,INSE,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Inspired PLC on Friday said it made ""good progress"" in the first half of 2024 with robust performance across all four of its divisions.
The Lancashire, England-based sustainability advisor reported momentum in new business generation in Assurance Revenue and good growth for ESG Services and Software Services.
Optimisation Services saw increased levels of repeatable demand from existing clients with the company expecting such revenue to account for 60% of its gross profit contribution in the second half.
Improved cash conversion of approximately 80% in the first half marked an increase from 75% for full-year 2023.
Inspired remains confident it can deliver full-year 2024 results in line with market consensus and management expectations.
Chief Executive Officer Mark Dickinson said: ""The group has delivered a robust H1 performance and is better placed than ever as a full-service provider of sustainability solutions for businesses. Managing energy costs and ESG are now firmly embedded as operationally and commercially critical for most businesses, creating sustained and increasing demand for Inspired's differentiated products and services.""
The termination of the deed of variation with Ignite Energy Ltd has resulted in no outstanding contingent consideration payment obligations.
After acquiring 40% of Ignite in August 2019, Inspired obtained full ownership in July 2020 after purchasing the remaining shares.
In May 2023, Inspired entered into the deed ""to refresh the unearned contingent consideration"" from the purchase agreement and reset a three-year timeframe to facilitate a full transition of leadership and integration.
Inspired now anticipates the full transition of senior leadership to complete on May 31, two years earlier than outlined in the deed, resulting in its termination.
Consequently, Inspired has entered into consultancy agreements with two Ignite vendors, David Higgins and Benjamin Higgins, equivalent to their previous employment contracts alongside a performance fee based on gross margin targets for Ignite during the restructuring period.
""Based on management's current expectations for the Ignite business, the total ""on target"" performance fee would be GBP2.3 million, payable in two instalments over H1 2025 and satisfied from existing cash resources,"" Inspired said.
In addition, following the final contingent payment of GBP2.2 million in the second half relating to the 2021 Businesswise Solutions Ltd transaction, Inspired will have no further contingent consideration payments to fund.
The company will release its interim results on September 12.
Inspired shares were flat at 70.00 pence each in London on late Friday morning.

PropertyGuru Agrees to Go Private in $1.1 Billion Deal,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PROPERTYGURU-GROUP-LIMITE-135355429/news/PropertyGuru-Agrees-to-Go-Private-in-1-1-Billion-Deal-47670553/,PGRU,Dow Jones,"By Ronnie Harui
SINGAPORE--PropertyGuru Group said it has entered into an agreement to be acquired by EQT Private Capital Asia in a deal that values the online property portal at about $1.1 billion.
Under the merger terms, PropertyGuru shareholders will receive $6.70 a share in cash, the company said Friday.
The offer represents a 52% premium to PropertyGuru's closing stock price on May 21, the last unaffected trading day before media speculation regarding a potential transaction, the Singapore-based company said.
PropertyGuru said its board of directors has unanimously approved the merger and recommended that shareholders approve it.
The transaction is expected to close in either the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, the company said.
Upon completion of the transaction, PropertyGuru's shares will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange, and PropertyGuru will become a private company.

Costain and Galliford Try picked for Southern Water contract framework,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GALLIFORD-TRY-HOLDINGS-PL-4001959/news/Costain-and-Galliford-Try-picked-for-Southern-Water-contract-framework-47670514/,GFRD,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Costain Group PLC and Galliford Try Holdings PLC on Friday said they have been selected by Southern Water Ltd to take part in the utility's GBP3.1 billion framework for wastewater treatment projects.
Worthing-based Southern Water provides water and wastewater collection and treatment in the southern part of England, including Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, East and West Sussex, and Kent.
UK water companies have been under public pressure in recent months over the excessive release of sewage into waterways. Southern Water made 108 permit breaches in 2023, according to a freedom of information request by political party the Liberal Democrats, the second most after Severn Trent PLC with 132.
Southern Water said the total value of the frameworks, including two earlier awards, is GBP3.7 billion over the initial contract terms of seven and five years. The contracts include options to extend for up to five years.
The utility said Costain and Galliford Try will be part of the 'strategic delivery partner' framework. This will be responsible for major infrastructure projects, such as constructing new pipelines and pumping stations, or non-infrastructure schemes, such as upgrades to water supply works or wastewater treatment works.
""This announcement marks an important milestone in our preparation for the next regulatory investment period 2025-30 and beyond. Southern plans to more than double its investment over the next five years to meet the needs of customers and the environment,"" said Southern Water Chief Financial Officer Stuart Ledger.
The award is worth at least GBP500 million to Costain over the initial seven years, the London-based infrastructure construction company said.
Galliford Try, which is based in Uxbridge, London, didn't provide a value for its portion, though it said the framework is a ""key strategic appointment for our business"".
Costain shares were up 2.6% to 91.33 pence early Friday in London. Galliford Try shares were up 1.2% to 304.60p.

Diversified Energy net profit dives; completes acquisition,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/DIVERSIFIED-ENERGY-COMPAN-33943281/news/Diversified-Energy-net-profit-dives-completes-acquisition-47670058/,DEC,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Diversified Energy Co PLC reported a year-on-year decline in production, amid a sharp fall in profit due to fair value adjustments, and announced the completion of a US acquisition.
The Alabama-based and US-focused natural gas producer on Thursday said net profit dropped to USD15.7 million in the first half of 2024 from USD630.9 million a year prior.
Notably, it reported a loss on fair value adjustments of unsettled financial instruments of USD80.1 million, swung from a gain of USD760.9 million.
Average net daily natural gas production fell 12% to 746 million cubic feet equivalent per day from 852 million reported a year prior.
It was up 3.2% from 723 million cubic feet equivalent per day posted for the first quarter.
The company declared a second quarter dividend of 29 US cents per share, compared to 4.38 cents a year before. However, Diversified last year conducted a share consolidation of 20 shares into 1, meaning the second quarter dividend effectively is down 67% from a year ago.
Diversified had cut its quarterly dividend to 29 cents in the first quarter, and this reduced payout was maintained in the second quarter.
Diversified Energy noted that it additionally returned a total of USD65 million in the first half of the year via its share buyback programme, repurchasing 2% outstanding shares.
Chief Executive Officer Rusty Hutson Jr said ""We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation framework, with the diversity and strength of our asset base providing a solid foundation for accretive growth and value creation for our shareholders, while maintaining our position as the 'right company at the right time' to responsibly manage long-life, mature producing assets.""
On Friday, Diversified Energy said it completed its acquisition of natural gas properties and related facilities from Crescent Pass Energy for a purchase price of USD106 million. The acquisition net purchase price is USD101 million after purchase price adjustments, which will be paid in cash and shares.
Diversified will issue to Crescent Pass 2.2 million new Diversified shares, about 4.8% of its total, and pay USD71 million in cash.
The acquisition of the assets, which are located in eastern Texas, brings in proved, developed and producing reserves of 28 million barrels of oil equivalent and current net production of 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
CEO Hutson said: ""We are excited to announce the completion of another attractively-priced acquisition of Central Region assets which stands to benefit Diversified as a result of our continued growth in scale and density throughout the asset footprint.""
Diversified Energy shares were 1.6% higher at 1,028.63 pence each on Friday morning in London.

Plaintiffs' lawyer - Deutsche Bank makes proposal for settlement with Postbank,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/DEUTSCHE-BANK-AG-56358396/news/Plaintiffs-lawyer-Deutsche-Bank-makes-proposal-for-settlement-with-Postbank-47669809/,DBK,Reuters,"In the legal dispute over the takeover of Postbank by Deutsche Bank, the Frankfurt-based bank has made a proposal for an amicable settlement of the dispute, according to a plaintiff's lawyer.
The plaintiffs, who argue that Postbank shareholders were entitled to a higher price when Postbank was taken over by Deutsche Bank 14 years ago, have been made such an offer, says lawyer Jan Bayer. However, he rejected the offer. Deutsche Bank stated that it did not wish to comment on the status of the talks with plaintiff groups.
The Cologne Higher Regional Court (OLG) is expected to decide on the case on Wednesday. According to an earlier announcement by the Frankfurt-based bank, the court had indicated that Postbank shareholders may have been entitled to a higher price. The maximum amount due to Postbank shareholders, including around 600 million euros in interest accrued since 2010, amounts to around 1.3 billion euros. The bank had formed a provision in the full amount of 1.3 billion euros - even if the actual amount could be lower.

Saint-Gobain: agreement to acquire Ovniver Group,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SAINT-GOBAIN-4697/news/Saint-Gobain-agreement-to-acquire-Ovniver-Group-47668269/,SGO,Cercle Finance,"Saint-Gobain announces a definitive agreement to acquire Ovniver Group, a leading unlisted player in construction chemicals in Mexico and Central America, for $815 million (approximately €740 million) in cash.
This new strategic step in the establishment of Saint-Gobain's global presence in construction chemicals will bring its total post-acquisition sales in this sector to 6.5 billion euros in 76 countries (pro forma).
With 16 production plants and around 1,000 employees, Ovniver should generate sales of $285 million in 2024, with growth of around 20% per year over the last five years, and achieve an estimated EBITDA margin of 21.7%.
The acquisition will be financed entirely from Saint-Gobain's available cash. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2025.

Whitehaven Coal to cut 192 jobs at mines purchased from BHP,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/WHITEHAVEN-COAL-LIMITED-6499701/news/Whitehaven-Coal-to-cut-192-jobs-at-mines-purchased-from-BHP-47667971/,WHC,Reuters,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - Australia's Whitehaven Coal
will cut a total of 192 jobs at the Daunia and Blackwater coking
coal mines it took over from global miner BHP Group,
the firm's spokesperson said on Friday.
Whitehaven in October announced plans of buying out the
Blackwater and Daunia mines, which are a part of BHP's alliance
with Mitsubishi, in a $4.1 billion deal.
It completed the acquisition in April this year.
""This proposed new structure will remove duplication of
roles, consolidate teams where logical, minimise unnecessary
layers of complexity, and support a clear delineation of roles
and responsibilities between site and functional teams,"" a
company spokesperson said.
Whitehaven will cut 91 roles across the Daunia and
Blackwater operations while reducing 101 contractor and labour
hire roles, the country's largest independent coal miner said in
an email to Reuters.

Chinalco Is Said to Eye Stake in Biggest Philippine Copper Mine,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ALUMINUM-CORPORATION-OF-C-1412627/news/Chinalco-Is-Said-to-Eye-Stake-in-Biggest-Philippine-Copper-Mine-47677182/,2600,S&P Capital IQ,"Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (SEHK:2600) is considering investing in what is set to be the Philippines? largest gold and copper mine as part of its efforts to boost its global footprint, according to people familiar with the matter. The state-run Chinese company known as Chinalco may acquire a stake worth around $2 billion in Indophil Resources Phils.
Inc., which owns Sagittarius Mines Inc., the people said, asking not to be identified because discussions are private. Sagittarius Mines is the developer of the Tampakan project in the southern island of Mindanao. The Sy family - among the Philippines?
richest clans - is the majority shareholder in the Tampakan project, the people said. Once production begins, a target currently set for 2026, it will be the largest mine in the Philippines. An investment from Chinalco would help provide financial stability to the project and it would possibly purchase some of the mine?s output, one of the people said.
Considerations are ongoing and the companies may still decide against pursuing a deal, the people said, adding that the project could also draw interest from other industry players. Geopolitical concerns represent another hurdle given recent tensions between China and the Philippines over territorial claims in the South China Sea. Chinalco, China?s largest state-owned aluminum producer, has investments in various mines from Guinea to Peru to secure raw material for the world?s biggest commodity consuming nation.

Waiting Game for Blackstone with Low-Ball Offer for Iress Up in Air,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKSTONE-INC-60951400/news/Waiting-Game-for-Blackstone-with-Low-Ball-Offer-for-Iress-Up-in-Air-47676637/,BX,S&P Capital IQ,"New York-based private equity fund Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) was believed to be looking at lobbing a bid for Iress Limited (ASX:IRE) that valued the stock at about $2 billion. The problem for Blackstone is that's where Iress is trading now. DataRoom understands that the private equity group offered somewhere around $10 or $11 a share.
On 15 August 2024, the shares closed at $10.49. The stock would likely have to return to the levels it was trading at about a year ago before a bid of that value would be considered, and that was when the company was travelling through rough waters with disappointing results. It means that this shapes as a waiting game for Blackstone, and Iress needs to deliver a strong set of numbers at its results on 19 August 2024 to prove it's worth a lot more.
A trading update on July 22 on earnings expectations was seen as a defensive play by Iress to Blackstone's interest. DataRoom in July reported that Blackstone was running the ruler over the Australian technology company. It is understood various parties have a running a file on Iress, including the Jarden-advised Thoma Bravo, while EQT has made efforts to buy the business in the past - and keeps an open file on Iress.
Bain Capital has been active in the space. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has also been an active buyer of Australian technology companies.","[{'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '1984-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Founder', 'Date': '1984-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Lionel Yves Assant', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Chief Investment Officer', 'Date': '2024-01-10'}, {'Name': 'David Payne', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Vikrant Sawhney', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Chief Administrative Officer', 'Date': '2019-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Kenneth Caplan', 'Age': '50 year', 'Position': 'Chief Investment Officer', 'Date': '2024-01-10'}, {'Name': 'Michael Chae', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2015-08-06'}, {'Name': 'John Finley', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2009-12-31'}, {'Name': 'John Finley', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Jonathan Gray', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '2018-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Jonathan Gray', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'President', 'Date': '2018-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Natasha Gopaul', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2015-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Natasha Gopaul', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2015-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Marisa Beeney', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2007-02-28'}, {'Name': 'Paige Ross', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '2016-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Wayne Berman', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'John Stecher', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 'Date': '2020-02-23'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2011-03-06'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2011-10-13'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee Chair', 'Date': '2010-06-15'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2007-03-19'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2017-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2017-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2019-05-12'}, {'Name': 'William Parrett', 'Age': '78 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2016-12-31'}, {'Name': 'William Parrett', 'Age': '78 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2016-12-31'}, {'Name': 'William Parrett', 'Age': '78 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2016-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Jim Breyer', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-03-23'}, {'Name': 'Jim Breyer', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-03-23'}, {'Name': 'Jim Breyer', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-03-23'}, {'Name': 'Rochelle Lazarus', 'Age': '76 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Rochelle Lazarus', 'Age': '76 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2014-01-08'}, {'Name': 'Jonathan Gray', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2012-02-23'}, {'Name': 'Joseph Baratta', 'Age': '53 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2020-03-01'}, {'Name': 'Ruth Porat', 'Age': '66 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Reginald Brown', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2020-09-14'}, {'Name': 'Reginald Brown', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Independent Dir/Board Member', 'Date': '2020-09-14'}]",Financials,"{'Company Name': 'Blackstone Inc.', 'Address Line 1': '345 Park Avenue', 'Address Line 2': '10154, New York', 'Phone Number': '+212 583 5000', 'Website': 'http://www.blackstone.com'}","{'Morocco', 'Western Sahara'}",{'United States'},"{'Morocco', 'Western Sahara', 'United States'}",United States,2024-08-15 00:00:00
"Boeing, Lockheed Reportedly in Talks to Sell Joint Venture to Sierra Space",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LOCKHEED-MARTIN-CORPORATI-13406/news/Boeing-Lockheed-Reportedly-in-Talks-to-Sell-Joint-Venture-to-Sierra-Space-47676495/,LMT,S&P Capital IQ,"The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are in talks to sell their rocket-launching joint venture United Launch Alliance, LLC to Sierra Space Corporation, two people familiar with the discussions said. A deal could value ULA at around $2 billion to $3 billion, the sources said. A deal to sell ULA, a major provider of launch services to the U.S. government and a top rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX, would mark a significant shift in the U.S. space launch industry as ULA separates from two of the defense contractors to a smaller, privately held firm.
The potential sale comes after years of speculation about ULA's future and failed attempts to divest the joint venture over the past decade. In 2019, Boeing and Lockheed Martin reportedly explored selling ULA but couldn't agree on terms with potential buyers. The negotiations could end without a deal, the sources said.
ULA referred Reuters to Boeing and Lockheed for comment. The two companies said they do not comment on market speculation. Sierra did not immediately return a request for comment.
A potential deal would be an ambitious move for Sierra Space, spun off from Sierra Nevada Corp. in 2021 to focus on bringing to market its long-delayed Dream Chaser spaceplane and building a private space station habitat with Blue Origin. Sierra Space has weighed a public offering.
A potential deal could accelerate deployment of its crewed spaceflight business, analysts said. A ULA acquisition, they said, would give the company in-house access to launch vehicles that could send its spaceplane and space-station components into Earth's orbit, rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars for those launches as a customer. For Boeing, the potential sale of ULA represents a strategic move under new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg, who took the helm in August.
A deal would allow Boeing to concentrate on its core aerospace and defense businesses while reaping some cash from ULA's sale.","[{'Name': 'Jim Taiclet', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2020-06-14'}, {'Name': 'Jim Taiclet', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'President', 'Date': '2020-06-14'}, {'Name': 'Mary Springer', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2015-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Jesus Malave', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2022-01-30'}, {'Name': 'Yvonne Hodge', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 'Date': '2020-05-31'}, {'Name': 'H.

Following an extension announcement by Capital & Regional on 18 July 2024, NewRiver was required, by no later than 5:00 p.m. (UK time) /6.00p.m. (SA time) on 15 August 2024, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Capital & Regional in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. On 19 July 2024, Praxis Group Limited (""Praxis"") announced that it was in the early stages of considering whether or not to make a cash offer for the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Capital & Regional.
In accordance with Rule 2.6(a) of the Code, Praxis is required, by no later than 5:00 p.m. (UK time) /6.00p.m. (SA time) on 16 August 2024, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Capital & Regional in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. To allow the discussions with each of NewRiver and Praxis (each a ""Potential Bidder"") to continue, the Board of Capital & Regional has requested, and the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Takeover Panel"") has consented to, extensions to the date by which each of the Potential Bidders is required to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for the Company or announce that it does not intend to make an offer. Consequently, in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code, each of the Potential Bidders is now required, by not later than 5.00 p.m. (UK time) /6.00 p.m. (SA time) on 12 September 2024, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Capital & Regional in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for the Company, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies.
In accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code, each revised deadline may be extended further at the request of the Board of Capital & Regional and with the consent of the Takeover Panel. In accordance with Rule 2.6(d), this deadline will cease to apply if either Potential Bidder (or any third-party) has announced a firm intention to make an offer for the Company. There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made for the Company, nor as to the terms on which any offer will be made.
The Company remains in an 'offer period' in accordance with the rules of the Code and the attention of Capital & Regional shareholders is drawn to the continuing disclosure requirements of Rule 8.","[{'Name': 'Robert Fearis', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2020-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Richard Morris', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2016-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Preston Wu', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '2018-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Adam Kitching', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2023-01-31'}, {'Name': 'Iain Torrens', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Iain Torrens', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Iain Torrens', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Stephanie Coxon', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-02-14'}, {'Name': 'Stephanie Coxon', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-14'}, {'Name': 'Stephanie Coxon', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-14'}, {'Name': 'Stephanie Coxon', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2022-05-24'}, {'Name': 'Stephanie Coxon', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2022-05-24'}, {'Name': 'Diane Seymour-Williams', 'Age': '65 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2019-07-31'}, {'Name': 'Diane Seymour-Williams', 'Age': '65 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2017-06-06'}, {'Name': 'Diane Seymour-Williams', 'Age': '65 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2020-11-02'}, {'Name': 'Diane Seymour-Williams', 'Age': '65 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-11-02'}, {'Name': 'Peter Gillson', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Robert Fearis', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-11-01'}, {'Name': 'Richard Morris', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2020-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Joshua Gallienne', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': ''}]",This company's sector is not yet available,"{'Company Name': 'Praxis Group Limited', 'Address Line 1': 'Sarnia House Le Truchot', 'Address Line 2': 'GY1 4NA, St. Peter Port', 'Phone Number': '+44 14 8173 7600', 'Website': 'http://www.praxisgroup.com'}",{'United Kingdom'},{'Guernsey'},"{'United Kingdom', 'Guernsey'}",Guernsey,2024-08-15 00:00:00

Playtech plc (LSE:PTEC) confirmed it was in exclusive talks with Flutter to sell its Snaitech S.p.A. division, which runs an Italian sports betting business. A sale would leave Playtech solely focused on providing technology to other gaming businesses.
New of the talks came as Flutter posted a 20% jump in revenues to $3.6 billion (£2.8 billion) in the three months to June. Net income rose 364% to $297 million. Growth was driven by good performance in the US, where the company owns the FanDuel fantasy sports app.

The two companies might close flanking or secondary Hindi general entertainment channels (GECs) to retain both the flagship Hindi GECs?Star Plus and Colors? in the merged entity, the people said.
Additionally, it plans to close channels in Kannada, Marathi, and Bangla language markets. The merged entity of Star and Viacom18 will enjoy more than 40% share in Hindi, GEC, Kannada, Bangla, and Marathi markets. It will become a virtual monopoly in sports broadcasting, holding all the key cricket and non-cricket rights.
Any entity that has more than 40% market share in a category is considered dominant by the CCI. RIL and Disney declined to comment. People said the two companies are hoping that the CCI might not ask them to shut or divest their flagship Hindi GECs, Star Plus and Colors, or part with certain cricket properties in exchange for shutting flanking Hindi GECs.
?Except the flagship channels, other Hindi GECs might be closed down. In the regional markets, the channels that are struggling will be shut down. Star has much more powerful regional channels than Viacom18, which is strong only in the Kannada market,"" one of the persons said.
Both RIL and Disney are hoping to close the merger by October.","[{'Name': 'Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2009-10-28'}, {'Name': 'Ajay

Orora Reportedly Makes Progress on $1.5 Billion OPS Package Deal Sell-Off,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ORORA-LIMITED-15256706/news/Orora-Reportedly-Makes-Progress-on-1-5-Billion-OPS-Package-Deal-Sell-Off-47662217/,ORA,S&P Capital IQ,"Private equity firms are being touted as the logical buyers for the US-based Orora Packaging Solutions, Inc. business, which sources believe could be worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. With UBS and Jarden on the ticket for the sale of the business, Orora Limited (ASX:ORA) made it known at its full-year result briefing that it was reasonably progressed with a potential sale. Last year, the Morgan Stanley-advised packaging distributor Veritiv Corporation was purchased by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, advised by Goldman Sachs, so it may be a buyer.
Among other major global private equity funds that invest in the US packaging industry are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Apollo Global Management, The Carlyle Group, Bain Capital, PAI Partners, Paine Schwartz, Abror Investments, Champlain Financial, Riverside and L Catterton. Some of the large shareholders in Orora are supportive of the move, given that proceeds could offer some relief to Orora's balance sheet, stretched after its $2.1 billion Saverglass acquisition last year. Yet as always it comes down to the numbers, with a strong price needed to justify parting with a business that has an attractive return on equity, and higher than other parts.
The unit has staged a solid performance under the leadership of Orora boss Brian Lowe, so if the price is not right, shareholders will likely be comfortable for it to be retained.","[{'Name': 'Brian Lowe', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2019-09-29'}, {'Name': 'Shaun C.

After the final bids have landed, an opportunity for due diligence will be offered in the UBS-advised competition. Expectations are that offers will be close to $700 million, but may fall slightly below that number as the business faces challenges linked to rising staff costs and the need for future investment as Healius makes capital spending on its pathology a priority.

(SGX:U96) have been shortlisted to submit binding bids to buy a significant majority stake in Ayana Renewable Power Private Limited, two people aware of the development said, in what may rank among the biggest transactions in India's green energy sector. These firms were the ones to submit their non-binding offers (NBOs) for the deal with an equity value of around $800 million, and are presently conducting due diligence, the people cited above said on the condition of anonymity. The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) backed company, which has a 5-gigawatt (GW) portfolio of operational and under-construction projects, is looking to sell a significant majority stake, that may translate into up to 100% stake sale.
The sale process is being run by Standard Chartered, with the last date for submitting final bids on 19 August. ""The Ayana transaction is a big one for the Indian renewable energy space and is being tracked intently for its outcome,"" said one of the two people cited above. Mint earlier reported about ONGC entering the fray, and Standard Chartered being mandated to manage the sale of Ayana Renewable Power, with the shareholders also seeking to raise an additional $400 million to finance the company's growth.
The Economic Times on 4 May reported about JSW Neo Energy, and Sekura Energy among five bidders that have made non-binding offers to acquire a controlling stake in Ayana Renewable Power; with Masdar, Sembcorp and Macquarie also in the fray. ""Post the submission of the NBOs, ONGC, JSW and Sembcorp were shortlisted. They are conducting due diligence to submit their binding bids for which 19 August is the bid submission deadline,"" the second person said.
Ayana Renewable Power is majority-owned by NIIF. Its other shareholders include the UK government's British International Investment and Eversource Capital. Ayana plans to build a 10GW portfolio by 2025 and has projects in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat.

Lone Star Reportedly Calls in Investment Bank to Assist in $3.4 Billion Bid for Packaging Outfit Orora,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ORORA-LIMITED-15256706/news/Lone-Star-Reportedly-Calls-in-Investment-Bank-to-Assist-in-3-4-Billion-Bid-for-Packaging-Outfit-Oro-47646547/,ORA,S&P Capital IQ,"Lone Star Americas Acquisitions, Inc. has tapped investment bank Macquarie Capital for its $3.4 billion buyout proposal for Orora Limited (ASX:ORA). Orora, which had a $2.6 billion market value at close of trade on August 12, 2024 when its share price was $1.91, has rejected the $2.55-a-share offer. ""The board, together with its advisers, carefully considered the indicative proposal and determined that it is not in the best interest of its shareholders to further engage with Lone Star on the basis of the indicative proposal, which materially undervalues Orora,"" it said.
The UBS-advised company has moved forward the delivery of its result for the year to June 30 by one day to August 14, when it plans to share progress on its strategy. Investors are bracing for bad news linked to weaker glass demand, with a destocking in the global spirit market and a US market downturn amid rising inflation. However, it went on to bid for the Australian arm of building materials company Jeld-Wen, which was sold to Platinum Equity for $688 million.
A year before its office opened, it bid for GE Capital's Australian-based loans, but missed out on the $2 billion portfolio to Sankaty Advisors, which is now called Bain Capital Credit.","[{'Name': 'Brian Lowe', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2019-09-29'}, {'Name': 'Shaun C.

Singh currently holds a 47.8% stake in the airline along with his family. Singh?s shareholding may drop to 30%-35% after the fundraising, though he will remain the largest shareholder.
The capital raise is intended to address the airline?s critical need for cash to maintain operations. The company plans to issue new shares to investors to expand its capital base, with ICICI Securities and JM Financial appointed to manage the process. Singh?s stake is also expected to increase by 9% later this year, contingent on his conversion of warrants into equity shares, which would require a payment of around INR 3,000 million.","[{'Name': 'Ajay Singh', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2015-05-20'}, {'Name': 'Chandan Sand', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2011-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Chandan Sand', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2011-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Chandan Sand', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2011-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Ajay Singh', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Ajay Singh', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Shiwani Singh', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2015-05-03'}, {'Name': 'Shiwani Singh', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2015-05-03'}, {'Name': 'Shiwani Singh', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2015-05-20'}, {'Name': 'Shiwani Singh', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Shiwani Singh', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Manoj Kumar', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-26'}, {'Name': 'Manoj Kumar', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2019-11-12'}, {'Name': 'Manoj Kumar', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2019-11-12'}, {'Name': 'Ajay Chhotelal Aggarwal', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Ajay Chhotelal Aggarwal', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Ajay Chhotelal Aggarwal', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2019-02-10'}, {'Name': 'Anurag Bhargava', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-05-08'}]",Industrials,"{'Company Name': 'SpiceJet Limited', 'Address Line 1': '319, Udyog Vihar Phase IV', 'Address Line 2': '122016, Gurgaon', 'Phone Number': '+91 12 4391 3939', 'Website': 'http://www.spicejet.com'}",{'India'},{'India'},{'India'},India,2024-08-13 00:00:00
Flutter Reportedly in Talks to Place £2 Billion Bet on Playtech Italian Arm,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FLUTTER-ENTERTAINMENT-PLC-120788844/news/Flutter-Reportedly-in-Talks-to-Place-2-Billion-Bet-on-Playtech-Italian-Arm-47662139/,FLUT,S&P Capital IQ,"The owner of Paddy Power is in talks to buy the consumer arm of London-listed Playtech plc (LSE:PTEC) in a deal that could be worth about £2 billion. Sky News has learnt that Flutter Entertainment plc (NYSE:FLUT), which recently moved its primary listing to the US, is in discussions to buy Snaitech S.p.A., one of Italy's biggest gambling companies. It was unclear on August 14, 2024 how advanced the talks were, but one source suggested that they were sufficiently detailed that Playtech would be required to publicly confirm them.
A formal agreement is unlikely to be reached until at least next month. If completed, a deal would value Snaitech at a premium to the current market capitalisation of Playtech, which also has a sizeable business-to-business gambling technology operation. A sale of the business to Flutter would leave Playtech as a pure-play B2B company which itself would be likely to attract interest from potential bidders.
Flutter, which now has a market capitalisation of almost £26 billion, and Playtech declined to comment.","[{'Name': 'Jeremy Jackson', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date':

Bikaji Foods Eyes Stake in Local Peer Ariba Foods,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIKAJI-FOODS-INTERNATIONA-146900609/news/Bikaji-Foods-Eyes-Stake-in-Local-Peer-Ariba-Foods-47654782/,BIKAJI,S&P Capital IQ,"Bikaji Foods International Limited (NSEI:BIKAJI) is eyeing acquiring an undisclosed stake in fellow Indian company Ariba Foods Pvt Ltd. The disclosure was made August 13, 2024 in a filing by Bikaji Foods with the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). Bikaji Foods said a board meeting will be held on Friday 23 August ""to consider and approve the acquisition of stake in Ariba Foods Private Limited, which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling frozen food"". It added that Bikaji Foods' shares will be suspended from trading from today until ""48 hours after the approval of the proposed acquisition"".
The size of the intended stake or an idea of the potential purchase price were not disclosed in the filing. Based in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, Ariba Foods' frozen portfolio includes mixed vegetables, vegetarian and non-vegetarian burgers, paratha, samosa and roti. Like Bikaji Foods, Ariba Foods also produces Indian snacks and sweets.
It supplies the retail and foodservice channels. Meanwhile, Jaipur, Rajasthan-based Bikaji Foods is primarily focused on local snacks varieties such as bhujia spicy snacks, namkeen savoury snacks, potato chips and papads. Set up in 1987, it supplies 23 of the 28 Indian states and four of the so-called union territories out of the eight across the country.
Last year, Bikaji Foods, which claims to be the third-largest Indian snacks maker in the country, took a 49% stake in fellow Indian snacks maker and start-up Bhujialalji. Bhujialalji was set up in 2021 and supplies branded products such as bhujia, a popular fried and spiced snack originating from Bikaner in Rajasthan. It serves the e-commerce channel and so-called quick commerce, a delivery service common in India, and also select retail.
In 2019, Bikaji Foods attracted interest from new investors. A fund under the umbrella of Indian financial services group Avendus Asset Management took a minority stake in Bikaji Foods from private-equityfirm Lighthouse and another investor, Intensive Softshare.","[{'Name': 'Deepak Agarwal', 'Age': '43 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2002-01-24'}, {'Name': 'Rishabh Narendra Jain', 'Age': '39 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2015-01-31'}, {'Name': 'Manoj Verma', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '2021-05-31'}, {'Name': 'Rahul Joshi', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2022-09-02'}, {'Name': 'Rahul Joshi', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2022-09-02'}, {'Name': 'Rahul Joshi', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2022-12-07'}, {'Name': 'Shiv Ratan Agarwal', 'Age': '73 year', 'Position': 'Chairman', 'Date': '1986-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Richa Manoj Goyal', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-12-07'}, {'Name': 'Richa Manoj Goyal', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2018-09-02'}, {'Name': 'Richa Manoj Goyal', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2018-09-02'}, {'Name': 'Richa Manoj Goyal', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-29'}, {'Name': 'Richa Manoj Goyal', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-29'}, {'Name': 'Richa Manoj Goyal', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Siraj Azmat Chaudhry', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-08-23'}, {'Name': 'Siraj Azmat Chaudhry', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-23'}, {'Name': 'Siraj Azmat Chaudhry', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-23'}, {'Name': 'Siraj Azmat Chaudhry', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-05'}, {'Name': 'Siraj Azmat Chaudhry', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-05'}, {'Name': 'Nikhil Kishorchandra Vora', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-12-07'}, {'Name': 'Nikhil Kishorchandra Vora', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2021-12-07'}, {'Name': 'Nikhil Kishorchandra Vora', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-12-07'}, {'Name': 'Sachin Kumar Bhartiya', 'Age': '46 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2014-04-10'}, {'Name': 'Sachin Kumar Bhartiya', 'Age': '46 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2014-04-10'}, {'Name': 'Sachin Kumar Bhartiya', 'Age': '46 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2014-04-10'}, {'Name': 'Pulkit Anilkumar Bachhawat', 'Age': '35 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-12-07'}, {'Name': 'Sunil Sethi', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-11-05'}, {'Name': 'Sunil Sethi', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Independent Dir/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-11-05'}, {'Name': 'Shweta Agarwal', 'Age': '43 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2006-11-19'}, {'Name': 'Deepak Agarwal', 'Age': '43 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2002-01-24'}]",Consumer Non-Cyclicals,"{'Company Name': 'Bikaji Foods International Limited', 'Address Line 1': 'Karni Extension RIICO Industrial Area', 'Address Line 2': '334004, Bikaner', 'Phone Number': '+91 15 1225 9914', 'Website': 'http://www.bikaji.in'}",{'India'},{'India'},{'India'},India,2024-08-13 00:00:00

KKR Reportedly Drops Plans to Sell School Chain Lighthouse,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/KKR-CO-INC-44486777/news/KKR-Reportedly-Drops-Plans-to-Sell-School-Chain-Lighthouse-47635349/,KKR,S&P Capital IQ,"KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) is all set to sell its education portfolio in India - Lighthouse Learning Private Limited (formerly Eurokids International). KKR has hired JP Morgan and Avendus to run the sale process, which is expected to be launched by next week, said two sources aware of the development.
KKR, which wanted to exit its 5-year old investment, eyes a valuation of $1 billion - $1.2 billion (INR 100.00 billion). Alpha Asia Holdings II Pte Ltd. (investment arm of KKR) holds 94.53% in the holding company Lighthouse Learning, while Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer Prajodh Rajan holds the balance 5.47% stake. Lighthouse, one among the educational groups, has seen interests from global educational institutions based out of the Middle East, Europe as well as PE buyout funds, added sources.
When contacted, KKR, Prajodh Rajan, JP Morgan, Avendus declined to comment., which had put its Indian school chain Lighthouse Learning (formerly Eurokids International) on the block, has dropped its selloff plans since it sees significant upside in the education sector at a time when multiple ed-tech unicorns are facing severe headwinds, said people aware of the development. They said KKR had just sent preliminary feelers to buyout funds and educational groups based out of West Asia and Europe to sell its five-year-old portfolio company, having hired JP Morgan and A vendus to run the sale process earlier this year. However, no financial details and other operational details were shared as the fund decided on the Uturn.","[{'Name': 'Scott Nuttall', 'Age': '51 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date':

Albemarle Reportedly May Look to Offload 49% Stake in Greenbushes Lithium Mine to IGO,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/IGO-LIMITED-6492590/news/Albemarle-Reportedly-May-Look-to-Offload-49-Stake-in-Greenbushes-Lithium-Mine-to-IGO-47639444/,IGO,S&P Capital IQ,"Speculation is mounting that US-based Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) may be considering selling down its 49% stake in the Greenbushes lithium mine to its Australian-listed partner IGO Limited (ASX:IGO), after the world's largest lithium producer this month slashed jobs and shut part of a processing facility in Western Australia. Greenbushes in WA is a global standout, and there is scepticism about the market chatter, although IGO wants to buy more of the asset should it be available, say sources. IGO did not comment.
One reason a sale may be on the table is that Greenbushes does not qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act benefits in the US because of its partial Chinese ownership of 25.1%. To quality, Chinese ownership would need to be 24.9% or less, although the US government may show some leniency. IGO and China's Tianqi both own 51% in a joint venture arrangement.
US-based lithium specialist Albemarle owns the remainder. The Australian reported last month that Albemarle, Tianqi and IGO would be taking the brakes off the giant Greenbushes mine despite low lithium prices, with the mine set to lift production over the next year as IGO intensifies its hunt for growth opportunities.","[{'Name': 'Ivan Vella', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2023-12-10'}, {'Name': 'Sam Retallack', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '2013-02-28'}, {'Name': 'Kate Barker', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2010-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Kate Barker', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2010-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Richard Glass', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Richard Glass', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Public Communications Contact', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Kathleen Bozanic', 'Age': '49 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2022-10-09'}, {'Name': 'Michael Nossal', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee', 'Date': '2021-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Debra Bakker', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee Chair', 'Date': '2016-12-13'}, {'Name': 'Debra Bakker', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Debra Bakker', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2023-06-18'}, {'Name': 'Debra Bakker', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-06-18'}, {'Name': 'Debra Bakker', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Debra Bakker', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Justin Osborne', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-30'}, {'Name': 'Justin Osborne', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Justin Osborne', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Justin Osborne', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Keith Spence', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Keith Spence', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2014-12-16'}, {'Name': 'Keith Spence', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2014-12-16'}, {'Name': 'Keith Spence', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-02-18'}, {'Name': 'Marcelo de Almeida Bastos', 'Age': '61 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2014-02-19'}, {'Name': 'Marcelo de Almeida Bastos', 'Age': '61 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2014-02-19'}, {'Name': 'Marcelo de Almeida Bastos', 'Age': '61 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2019-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Samantha Hogg', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2022-03-28'}, {'Name': 'Samantha Hogg', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee Chair', 'Date': '2019-10-31'}, {'Name': 'Samantha Hogg', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Tracey Arlaud', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-09'}, {'Name': 'Tracey Arlaud', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Tracey Arlaud', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Xiao Ping Yang', 'Age': '66 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-11-30'}, {'Name': 'Xiao Ping Yang', 'Age': '66 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2021-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Ivan Vella', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-12-10'}]",Basic Materials,"{'Company Name': 'IGO Limited', 'Address Line 1': 'South Shore Centre 85 South Perth Esplanade', 'Address Line 2': '6151, South Perth', 'Phone Number': '+61 8 9238 8300', 'Website': 'http://www.igo.com.au'}","{'Christmas Island', 'Australia', 'Cocos Islands'}",{'Unknown'},"{'Christmas Island', 'Australia', 'Cocos Islands'}",Australia,2024-08-12 00:00:00

Sumitomo's Global Head Reportedly Visiting India to Discuss Buying Yes Bank Stake,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/STATE-BANK-OF-INDIA-18603402/news/Sumitomo-s-Global-Head-Reportedly-Visiting-India-to-Discuss-Buying-Yes-Bank-Stake-47625048/,SBIN,S&P Capital IQ,"The chief of one of Japan's lenders will be visiting India this week to discuss buying a stake in Yes Bank Limited (NSEI:YESBANK), as a global race heats up to grab a significant holding in the private lender. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation's (SMBC) Akihiro Fukutome, who was appointed the bank's global chief executive officer last year, will be visiting India this week for the first time, according to three persons aware of the matter. Fukutome will be meeting with officials of the Reserve Bank of India and State Bank of India (NSEI:SBIN) to discuss buying a stake in the Indian lender.
SMBC is looking at a valuation of around $5 billion for a 51% stake in Yes Bank, according to one of the persons cited above. ""SMBC has already started due diligence, seeking details from Yes Bank. The global CEO is meeting with senior officials of RBI and SBI early this week to discuss the stake sale plan,"" said this person.
State-owned SBI, which owns a 23.99% stake in Yes Bank, has been looking to pare its holding in the private lender. It had initially acquired a 49% stake as part of a 2020 government-engineered rescue of Yes Bank. Mint reported on 9 July that RBI has approved the sale of up to a 51% stake in Yes Bank, a rare decision for the regulator, which has capped 26% as promoter holding in domestic banks.
The Japanese lender has appointed JPMorgan as the financial adviser for the proposed stake acquisition, and J Sagar Associates as the legal adviser, according to a second person. ""The Japanese will engage directly with the central bank and SBI officials. This is what even the bankers have advised them,"" this person said.
Yes Bank has appointed Citigroup to shortlist suitable promoters. ""As stated earlier as well and also clarified to stock exchanges, we have no comments to offer regarding stake sale as these inquiries are speculative in nature,"" a spokesperson for Yes Bank in reply to Mint's queries. SMBC, SBI, RBI, J Sagar Associates and JPMorgan didn't immediately reply to Mint's emails.","[{'Name': 'Challa Sreenivasulu Setty', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Misal Singh', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '2016-09-30'}, {'Name': 'Kameshwar Rao Kodavanti', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2023-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Kishore Kumar Poludasu', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '2024-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Ranjan Gupta', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Aruna Nitin Dak', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2023-04-04'}, {'Name': 'Aruna Nitin Dak', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2023-04-04'}, {'Name': 'Pravin Raghavendra', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Rana Ashutosh Kumar Singh', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2024-08-06'}, {'Name': 'Dinesh Kumar Khara', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-10-06'}, {'Name': 'Dinesh Kumar Khara', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2023-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Dinesh Kumar Khara', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Dinesh Kumar Khara', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Mrugank Madhukar Paranjape', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Mrugank Madhukar Paranjape', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Mrugank Madhukar Paranjape', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Ketan Shivji Vikamsey', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Ketan Shivji Vikamsey', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Ketan Shivji Vikamsey', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Rajesh Kumar Dubey', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2023-05-29'}, {'Name': 'Rajesh Kumar Dubey', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2023-05-29'}, {'Name': 'Rajesh Kumar Dubey', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2023-05-29'}, {'Name': 'Dharmendra Singh Shekhawat', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2023-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Dharmendra Singh Shekhawat', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-06-25'}, {'Name': 'Prafulla Premsukh Chhajed', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-12-20'}, {'Name': 'Prafulla Premsukh Chhajed', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Swati Gupta', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2023-05-08'}, {'Name': 'Swati Gupta', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-05-08'}, {'Name': 'Challa Sreenivasulu Setty', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2020-01-19'}, {'Name': 'Vinay Muralidhar Tonse', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2023-11-21'}, {'Name': 'Ajay Kumar', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-07-13'}, {'Name': 'Vivek Joshi', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2022-11-14'}, {'Name': 'Ashwini Kumar Tewari', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2021-01-27'}]",Financials,"{'Company Name': 'State Bank of India', 'Address Line 1': 'Corporate Centre State Bank Bhavan, Madame Cama Road', 'Address Line 2': '400021, Mumbai', 'Phone Number': '+91 22 2274 0841', 'Website': 'http://www.sbi.co.in'}",{'India'},{'India'},{'India'},India,2024-08-12 00:00:00

Private Equity Reportedly Pursues Ramsay,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/RAMSAY-HEALTH-CARE-LIMITE-6492228/news/Private-Equity-Reportedly-Pursues-Ramsay-47623866/,RHC,S&P Capital IQ,"A European private equity firm is understood to be running the ruler over the $10 billion Ramsay Health Care Limited (ASX:RHC), with an eye to becoming the second group in two years to launch a buyout proposal for the nation's largest private hospital operator. Ramsay last week flagged that it would deliver weaker-than-expected earnings for the full year as it wrote down the value of its European operation. The hospital operator, which is scheduled to release its full-year results on August 30, told the ASX last Monday that its underlying net profit was expected to be in the range of $265 million to $270 million, compared with $278.2 million the previous year.
Ramsay was considered a takeover target earlier this year, with the Perth-based conglomerate Wesfarmers known to be running the ruler over the business some time ago. It is understood that Wesfarmers Limited (ASX:WES), which recently appointed Ramsay's former chief operating officer Kate Munnings, to its board carried out extensive and detailed work on a potential buyout of Ramsay and an acquisition of the country's largest diagnostic imaging provider I-MED, which is expected to be put on the block next month for about $3 billion through Morgan Stanley and Jefferies. However, Wesfarmers thought Ramsay would have to be far cheaper before it would make its move - despite Ramsay's share price being at its lowest level in a decade, about a third cheaper than it was after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bid for the business in 2022.
Some think the European suitor may be CVC, while Partners Group, which is also based in Europe, has looked at Australian healthcare company Healius, and EQT could also be an acquirer. Other European funds that invest in healthcare include Permira, PAI and Intermediate Capital. Some think a company with real estate expertise would be the most likely to have interest because of Ramsay's lucrative portfolio of hospital assets in Australia.
There's also a view that any deal involving Ramsay would unfold after it has demerged or sold its Ramsay Sante operation in Europe. Ramsay, whose David Thodey-led board recently appointed former Woolworths executive Natalie Davis as chief executive to replace Craig McNally, has been trying to find a solution for that part of the company, which has lagged in performance. Ramsay Health Care owns 52.79% of Ramsay Sante, the second-largest private care provider in Europe, and a sale would help to reduce its $4.7 billion of debt.
Buyers are not interested in the whole business, but it could try to sell a stake.","[{'Name': 'Craig McNally', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2017-07-02'}, {'Name': 'Henrietta Rowe', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2019-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Henrietta Rowe', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2019-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Colleen Harris', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '2018-01-07'}, {'Name': 'Martyn Roberts', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2020-04-19'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Hibbins', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '2020-07-31'}, {'Name': 'Edward Byrne', 'Age': '72 year', 'Position': 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 'Date': '2021-03-31'}, {'Name': 'David Thodey', 'Age': '70 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-01-31'}, {'Name': 'David Thodey', 'Age': '70 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-01-31'}, {'Name': 'David Thodey', 'Age': '70 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-02-25'}, {'Name': 'Karen Penrose', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2015-11-25'}, {'Name': 'Karen Penrose', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee', 'Date': '2022-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Karen Penrose', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2015-11-25'}, {'Name': 'Karen Penrose', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2022-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Karen Penrose', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2023-12-17'}, {'Name': 'Karen Penrose', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-22'}, {'Name': 'Catriona Deans', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-08-20'}, {'Name': 'Catriona Deans', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2018-11-14'}, {'Name': 'Catriona Deans', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2018-11-14'}, {'Name': 'Catriona Deans', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-11-14'}, {'Name': 'Catriona Deans', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-11-25'}, {'Name': 'Helen Kurincic', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-10-19'}, {'Name': 'Helen Kurincic', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2020-10-19'}, {'Name': 'Helen Kurincic', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'HR Committee', 'Date': '2020-10-19'}, {'Name': 'Helen Kurincic', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-10-19'}, {'Name': 'Steven Sargent', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Steven Sargent', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Steven Sargent', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Claudia Dyckerhoff', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2016-02-29'}, {'Name': 'Claudia Dyckerhoff', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2016-04-20'}, {'Name': 'Craig McNally', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2017-06-21'}, {'Name': 'Craig McNally', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2017-06-21'}, {'Name': 'James McMurdo', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Michael Siddle', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '1967-12-31'}]",Healthcare,"{'Company Name': 'Ramsay Health Care Limited', 'Address Line 1': 'Deutche Bank Place 126 Phillip Street', 'Address Line 2': '2000, Sydney', 'Phone Number': '+61 2 9220 1000', 'Website': 'https://www.ramsayhealth.com/contact-us'}","{'Christmas Island', 'Australia', 'Cocos Islands'}",{'Australia'},{'Australia'},Australia,2024-08-11 00:00:00
CreditAccess Reportedly Scouts A New Owner with $2.7 Billion Valuation,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CREDITACCESS-GRAMEEN-LIMI-46901476/news/CreditAccess-Reportedly-Scouts-A-New-Owner-with-2-7-Billion-Valuation-47623483/,CREDITACC,S&P Capital IQ,"CreditAccess Grameen Limited (NSEI:CREDITACC) may soon have a new owner with its Dutch promoter looking to exit, two people aware of the development said. The Netherlands-based CreditAccess India BV which holds a 66.56% stake, is seeking a valuation of around $2.7 billion for the microfinancier, the people said, in what would be the biggest deal in India's $51 billion microfinance industry. The promoters have already hired investment bankers Jefferies, Barclays Investment Bank and Bank of America to shortlist buyers, said one of the people cited above, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
The investment bankers have already reached out to some privately held banks and large financial institutions, the people cited above said. If the deal talks go through, the takeover will entail an open offer, since CreditAccess Grameen is a listed firm. It will also require approvals from the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Promoters and investment bankers are contemplating a valuation of INR 230.00 billion - INR 240.00 billion for CreditAccess Grameen, said the two persons. According to its Friday closing price, the company has a market value of INR 200.00 billion. ""Given its unique positioning and low cost to asset supporting sustained interest income margin growth, the business of CreditAccess Grameen should command 15% - 20% premium on the current market value, and preliminary talks for the potential takeover have attracted several banks,"" said the first person.
CreditAcccess India B.V. is backed by US-based private equity firm Olympus Capital Asia, Asian Development Bank, a clutch of family offices and high net worth individuals. With gross loan assets of INR 267.00 billion at the end of FY24, CreditAccess Grameen is the country's largest among 87 microfinance firms. In the promoter group entity-CreditAccess India B.V.-Olympus Capital Asia, a fund that focuses on mid-cap Asian companies, alone holds 15%. Emails sent to CreditAccess India B.V, ADB, Olympus Capital, CreditAccess Grameen, Paolo Brichetti (founder of CreditAccess India), as well as to Daniel Mintz and Frederick Long (founders of Olympus) remained unanswered.

Fujitsu Reportedly Poised to Offload Its Data Centre Portfolio in $1 Billion Deal,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BLACKSTONE-INC-60951400/news/Fujitsu-Reportedly-Poised-to-Offload-Its-Data-Centre-Portfolio-in-1-Billion-Deal-47616955/,BX,S&P Capital IQ,"Fujitsu Limited (TSE:6702) is believed to be selling its portfolio in Australia in a deal that could be worth somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion. Fujitsu operates six data centres in Australia as part of a global portfolio of 140, including the Western Sydney Data Centre in Greystanes with a capacity of 92 megawatts over 24,000sq m. Other assets include Noble Park Melbourne with 28MW across 8,500sq m, Malaga in Western Australia (10MW), Eight Mile Plains in Queensland (2MW), and Homebush (3MW) and North Ryde (4.8MW) in NSW. Advisory firm Sayers is working on the sale.
It's being pitched as an opportunity to combine the business with the Amber Infrastructure data centre business iSeek, which is currently on the market. That business is thought to be worth about $400 million. It consists of five data centres across Brisbane, northern Queensland, Sydney and South Australia.
The South Australian asset comprises two data centres located to the north and south of Adelaide. They were recently bought by Amber Infrastructure as part of its YourDC acquisition. Other assets currently up for sale include Global Switch's Sydney-based data centres, which have a $2 billion plus asking price, along with AirTrunk.
A $2 billion stake in CDC Data Centres, owner Commonwealth Super, is also tipped to soon be on the market. As earlier reported, Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) is firming as the favourite to buy AirTrunk, thought to have an asking price of about $15 billion, with Canadian pension funds possibly joining forces with the New York-based buyout fund. As suitors get ready to lob final offers in the week beginning August 26, DataRoom understands the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board is expected to pair up with Blackstone in the race, while another Canadian fund, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), may also surface.
IFM, Silver Lake and GIP have linked up with DigitalBridge. The sale process is on a tight time frame when complexity is taken into account. Goldman Sachs and Macquarie Capital are overseeing the process for owners Macquarie Group, PSP and founder Robin Khuda.
AirTrunk has over 1.4GW of data centre capacity across 11 sites and a pipeline for further capacity.","[{'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '1984-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Founder', 'Date': '1984-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Lionel Yves Assant', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Chief Investment Officer', 'Date': '2024-01-10'}, {'Name': 'David Payne', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Vikrant Sawhney', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Chief Administrative Officer', 'Date': '2019-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Kenneth Caplan', 'Age': '50 year', 'Position': 'Chief Investment Officer', 'Date': '2024-01-10'}, {'Name': 'Michael Chae', 'Age': '55 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2015-08-06'}, {'Name': 'John Finley', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2009-12-31'}, {'Name': 'John Finley', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Jonathan Gray', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '2018-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Jonathan Gray', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'President', 'Date': '2018-02-12'}, {'Name': 'Natasha Gopaul', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2015-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Natasha Gopaul', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2015-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Marisa Beeney', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2007-02-28'}, {'Name': 'Paige Ross', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '2016-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Wayne Berman', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'John Stecher', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Tech/Sci/R&D Officer', 'Date': '2020-02-23'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2011-03-06'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2011-10-13'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee Chair', 'Date': '2010-06-15'}, {'Name': 'Stephen Schwarzman', 'Age': '77 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2007-03-19'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2017-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2017-03-31'}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Kelly Ayotte', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2019-05-12'}, {'Name': 'William Parrett', 'Age': '78 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2016-12-31'}, {'Name': 'William Parrett', 'Age': '78 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2016-12-31'}, {'Name': 'William Parrett', 'Age': '78 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2016-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Jim Breyer', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2021-03-23'}, {'Name': 'Jim Breyer', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-03-23'}, {'Name': 'Jim Breyer', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-03-23'}, {'Name': 'Rochelle Lazarus', 'Age': '76 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Rochelle Lazarus', 'Age': '76 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2014-01-08'}, {'Name': 'Jonathan Gray', 'Age': '54 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2012-02-23'}, {'Name': 'Joseph Baratta', 'Age': '53 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2020-03-01'}, {'Name': 'Ruth Porat', 'Age': '66 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Reginald Brown', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2020-09-14'}, {'Name': 'Reginald Brown', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Independent Dir/Board Member', 'Date': '2020-09-14'}]",Financials,"{'Company Name': 'Blackstone Inc.', 'Address Line 1': '345 Park Avenue', 'Address Line 2': '10154, New York', 'Phone Number': '+212 583 5000', 'Website': 'http://www.blackstone.com'}","{'Morocco', 'Western Sahara'}",{'United States'},"{'Morocco', 'Western Sahara', 'United States'}",United States,2024-08-08 00:00:00

Ayala Land Says AirSWIFT Entices ?Several Buyers?,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CEBU-AIR-INC-7641135/news/Ayala-Land-Says-AirSWIFT-Entices-Several-Buyers-47623972/,CEB,S&P Capital IQ,"Ayala Land, Inc. (PSE:ALI) said it hopes to complete the sale of its boutique airline AirSWIFT within the year and is considering offers from several buyers, not just Cebu Pacific. ?We hope so, but we?re still in discussions. Maybe around this time next month, there?ll be something more definitive,?
ALI Chief Finance Officer Augusto D. Bengzon told reporters on 07 August 2024, in response to whether the company plans to complete the sale within the year. ALI Head of Leasing and Hospitality Mariana Zobel de Ayala said the property developer is also in talks with other airlines for the planned sale of AirSWIFT, aside from the Gokongwei-led Cebu Air, Inc. (PSE:CEB). ?When we started this process, our objective really was what would be the best customer experience.
So we thought it would be best to cast a wide net. That?s how we started the process. Right now, we are progressing with our talks with Cebu Pacific,?
she said. ?It is not exclusive in the sense that we are entertaining several (buyers). But I guess what came out in the news is our discussions with the Gokongwei group,?
she added. In a statement, Cebu Pacific said it ?is always on the lookout for opportunities to grow and expand its network, including partnership with other parties.? Ms. Zobel said the planned sale of Air-SWIFT will allow ALI to focus on its core competency of land development.
?The terms are not confirmed yet. But I think the principle really is that our core competency is in developing land and land-related products,? she said.
?We hope to continue focusing on that and ensure that we can deliver the right experience by partnering with a group whose focus is in aviation,? she added. Meanwhile, Mr. Bengzon said that one of the requirements of the possible deal is to continue the existing flights to ALI properties such as the Lio tourism estate in El Nido, Palawan.
?For our Lio estate, we still own the airport there. Whoever ends up purchasing AirSWIFT will need to service our resorts in Palawan. It?s one of the requirements,?

"Torrent, Zydus Reportedly Make Cut for JB Buyout",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EQT-AB-66480635/news/Torrent-Zydus-Reportedly-Make-Cut-for-JB-Buyout-47620665/,EQT,S&P Capital IQ,"Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited (BSE:500420 and Zydus Lifesciences Limited (NSEI:ZYDUSLIFE), the fifth and the sixth largest domestic drugmakers, are set to battle it out for J. B. Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Limited (BSE:506943), possibly along with EQT AB (publ) (OM:EQT) and others, said people with knowledge of the matter. The duo was shortlisted in the past few days after the first round of screening by KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR), current owner of the 48-year-old JB Pharma.
Torrent, seen as the strongest suitor, has initiated discussions with banks for financing. Private equity fund EQT is also expected to make the cut, while Hyderabad-headquartered Dr Reddy?s Laboratories is understood to have sent feelers to KKR but is yet to submit any offer, said the people cited. KKR arm TAU Investment owns 53.78% of JB Pharma, which has a market value of INR 297.69 billion ($3.5 billion).
The acquisition will trigger an open offer for another 26%, as it will lead to a change of control, which means the new owner could end up paying as much as INR 235.1751 billion ($2.8 billion). ET was the first to report May 4 that domestic pharmaceutical companies and bulge-bracket private equity firms had shown interest in the asset. KKR declined to comment.
Torrent, Zydus, EQT and DRL didn?t respond to queries. Zydus may be reluctant to pursue the asset unless the valuation drops, said the people cited above. The JB Chemicals stock has appreciated 18.2% in 2024 in anticipation of a transaction.
?Given the synergistic benefits and potential to create long-term value, strategic players are consistently outbidding large buyout funds in the pharma space, similar to what we recently saw in the Mankind-BSV transaction,? said VP Rajan, MD, Veda Corporate Advisors. ?PE funds may have built large pharma platforms through the last few years of consolidation.
However, active participation of strategic for large opportunities has made it tougher for PEs to match up the price keeping their relatively shorter exit horizons?.","[{'Name': 'Christian Sinding', 'Age': '52 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2018-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Kim Henriksson', 'Age': '56 year', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2018-09-30'}, {'Name': 'Anna Wahlström', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '2017-09-30'}, {'Name': 'Jan Svensson', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Christina Drews', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '2022-05-31'}, {'Name': 'Yngve Conni Jonsson', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2018-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Yngve Conni Jonsson', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2014-02-28'}, {'Name': 'Yngve Conni Jonsson', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2013-08-25'}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2022-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2022-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2015-07-31'}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2018-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-09-30'}, {'Name': 'Gordon Orr', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2022-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Marcus Wallenberg', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-06-01'}, {'Name': 'Marcus Wallenberg', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2009-11-05'}, {'Name': 'Marcus Wallenberg', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'HR Committee', 'Date': '2009-11-05'}, {'Name': 'Marcus Wallenberg', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-09-17'}, {'Name': 'Marcus Wallenberg', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-06-01'}, {'Name': 'Diony Lebot', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-07'}, {'Name': 'Diony Lebot', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Governance Committee', 'Date': '2023-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Diony Lebot', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-06-30'}, {'Name': 'Margo L.

It plans to rename all the 24Seven stores in the country after The New Shop, executives directly aware of the matter told The Economic Times.
This comes over a week after the cigarette maker said that it received judicial clearance to shut down its loss-making 24Seven retail business after a court ruled in favour of the company. The New Shop was founded in 2019 by entrepreneur siblings Aastha and Charak Almast, along with Mani Dev Gyawali. At present, it operates 160 stores across 35 cities in the country.
Employing an omnichannel approach, the brand sells a wide range of products, including grocery staples, snacks and beverages, personal care, home care, and hygiene products among others. Running on a franchise-owned, franchise-operated model, it has its stores open 24 hours every day.

Fortis Healthcare Reportedly to Buy Out PE Funds from Diagnostics Arm Agilus,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FORTIS-HEALTHCARE-LIMITED-9059727/news/Fortis-Healthcare-Reportedly-to-Buy-Out-PE-Funds-from-Diagnostics-Arm-Agilus-47608984/,FORTIS,S&P Capital IQ,"Fortis Healthcare Limited (NSEI:FORTIS) is set to acquire the stake of private equity firms in its own diagnostics arm Agilus Diagnostics Limited (formerly SRL), according to sources in the know. Jacob Ballas and International Finance Corporation (IFC), who along with Resurgence PE own around 34% stake in the diagnostics company, are selling their stake and exercising a put option. The deal will peg the valuation of Agilus at around INR 50,000 million, the people cited earlier said.
Fortis Healthcare informed in a late afternoon stock exchange filing that Jacob Ballas had expressed its intent to exercise its put option. ""The company has received a letter in respect of the exercise of put option right by NYLIM Jacob Ballas India Fund III, LLC (one of the PE investors) for 12.4 million equity shares equivalent to 15.86% equity stake held by them in Agilus for INR 9,050 million,"" the Fortis statement said. However, the other investors are expected to exercise their respective put options by early next week, according to sources.
This will result in Fortis Healthcare consolidating its holding in the diagnostics company from its present stake of about 57% to about 91%. The remaining shares in Agilus are held by individual investors. ET first reported the latest developments in its online edition on August 8. Fortis' majority shareholder IHH Healthcare had earlier tried to help the private equity investors get an exit by mandating Kotak Mahindra Capital to find a buyer for their stake.
However, that transaction did not proceed as planned. Fortis Healthcare and IFC had not responded to ET's queries as of press time. Jacob Ballas refused to comment.
Resurgence PE investments could not be contacted.","[{'Name': 'Ashutosh Raghuvanshi', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2019-03-18'}, {'Name': 'Prabhat Kumar', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2015-04-30'}, {'Name': 'Sanjay Baweja', 'Age': '63 year', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '2024-03-12'}, {'Name': 'Satyendra Chauhan', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2024-02-29'}, {'Name': 'Satyendra Chauhan', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '2024-02-29'}, {'Name': 'Satyendra Chauhan', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Corporate Secretary', 'Date': '2024-02-29'}, {'Name': 'Daljit Singh', 'Age': '71 year', 'Position': 'President', 'Date': '2002-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Vivek Kumar Goyal', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2019-04-07'}, {'Name': 'Anil Vinayak', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Ravi Rajagopal', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2018-06-22'}, {'Name': 'Ravi Rajagopal', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Finance Committee', 'Date': '2019-04-28'}, {'Name': 'Ravi Rajagopal', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2018-06-22'}, {'Name': 'Ravi Rajagopal', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Ravi Rajagopal', 'Age': '69 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2018-06-22'}, {'Name': 'Shailaja Chandra', 'Age': '80 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-27'}, {'Name': 'Shailaja Chandra', 'Age': '80 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-06-27'}, {'Name': 'Shailaja Chandra', 'Age': '80 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2020-06-27'}, {'Name': 'Shailaja Chandra', 'Age': '80 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Shailaja Chandra', 'Age': '80 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Suvalaxmi Chakraborty', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Suvalaxmi Chakraborty', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-06-22'}, {'Name': 'Suvalaxmi Chakraborty', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-06-22'}, {'Name': 'Suvalaxmi Chakraborty', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2018-06-22'}, {'Name': 'Indrajit Banerjee', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-08'}, {'Name': 'Indrajit Banerjee', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2021-02-08'}, {'Name': 'Indrajit Banerjee', 'Age': '68 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2021-02-08'}, {'Name': 'Ashok Pandit', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2023-09-14'}, {'Name': 'Ashok Pandit', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2023-09-14'}, {'Name': 'Ashok Pandit', 'Age': '58 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-09-14'}, {'Name': 'Prem Kumar Nair', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2023-11-16'}, {'Name': 'Prem Kumar Nair', 'Age': '64 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2023-11-16'}, {'Name': 'Dilip Kadambi', 'Age': '50 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2020-06-03'}, {'Name': 'Tsin Lin Lim', 'Age': '45 year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2015-11-30'}, {'Name': 'Ashutosh Raghuvanshi', 'Age': '62 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2019-03-18'}, {'Name': 'Mehmet Aydinlar', 'Age': '67 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-03-27'}, {'Name': 'Tomo Nagahiro', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Director/Board Member', 'Date': '2023-03-27'}]",Healthcare,"{'Company Name': 'Fortis Healthcare Limited', 'Address Line 1': 'Tower A, Unitech Business Park South City 1, Sector - 41', 'Address Line 2': '122001, Gurgaon', 'Phone Number': '+91 12 4492 1033', 'Website': 'http://www.fortishealthcare.com'}",{'India'},{'India'},{'India'},India,2024-08-07 00:00:00

Last year, the efforts to divest stake in Adani Wilmar, as part of the group's exercise to exit non-core businesses, came to a halt with expectation mismatch on pricing and valuations between the buyers and seller. The valuation was considerably lower than what the promoters wanted.

Mizuho Reportedly Plans to Say No to Yes Bank Deal,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EMIRATES-NBD-BANK-9059466/news/Mizuho-Reportedly-Plans-to-Say-No-to-Yes-Bank-Deal-47590410/,EMIRATESNBD,S&P Capital IQ,"Japanese financial giant Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. (TSE:8411) plans to exit the race for a significant stake in Yes Bank Limited (NSEI:YESBANK), leaving Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Emirates NBD Bank PJSC (DFM:EMIRATESNBD) as the two serious contenders in the fray, said people with knowledge of the matter. India?s sixth-largest private bank by assets is seeking a new owner four years following a turnaround after a central bank-orchestrated rescue. The top leadership of the Japanese bank took the decision to opt out in recent days, said the people cited above.
Yes Bank has a market value of INR 730,206.7 million. A 51% stake sale would make it India?s largest banking sector M&A. SBI denied it's selling its stake in Yes Bank. ?We reserve our comments to queries that are speculative in nature,?
a Yes Bank spokesperson told ET. SMBC declined to comment. Mizuho?s India representatives and Emirates NBD spokespersons in Abu Dhabi did not respond to queries.
According to the people cited, Mizuho wanted to make a financial investment and acquire 20-24% stake in the bank with no board representation. It also did not want to trigger any open offer to buy an additional 26% of the bank. The management may have developed cold feet after seeing foreign direct investment (FDI) from Japan in the financial sector getting stuck.
Negotiations between Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), Japan?s largest financial institution, and HDFC Bank for a near $2 billion investment in HDB Financial Services at a $9-10 billion valuation are said to be stuck. HDB Financial Services, the non-banking arm of the private lender, is headed for an IPO. MUFG was also tapped for Yes Bank, but the institution chose not to engage after initial discussions.
MUFG?s proposed investment in HDB was billed as the largest FDI in financial services in India. While US banks are pulling back from India, European ones don?t have the capital to invest, said an executive. The Centre isn?t keen on Chinese involvement, which leaves Japan and West Asia, with the former having deeper roots and wider institutional presence in India over the past decade, the person said.
?It?s obvious that Japan Inc. will see this (HDB-MUFG) as a lack of determination or assistance from the government to ensure large FDI from Japan is welcome,? the person said. ?There isn?t an existing large Japanese ecosystem in India like other countries in Asean, so even a solitary case gets disproportionate attention and sets the narrative.?
Sluggish growth in Japan has led some of its biggest lenders and financial services groups to seek inorganic growth opportunities across Asia.","[{'Name': 'Shayne Nelson', 'Age': '65 year', 'Position': 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Date': '2012-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Simon Copleston', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'General Counsel', 'Date': '2020-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Victor Matafonov', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Compliance Officer', 'Date': '2014-05-31'}, {'Name': 'Amer Kazim', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Comptroller/Controller/Auditor', 'Date': '2018-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Ammar Al Haj', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Treasurer', 'Date': '2006-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Abdulla Qassem', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Chief Operating Officer', 'Date': '2010-01-04'}, {'Name': 'Eman Mahmood Ahmed Abdulrazzaq', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Human Resources Officer', 'Date': '2019-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Patrick Sullivan', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Director of Finance/CFO', 'Date': '2019-12-31'}, {'Name': 'Patrick Clerkin', 'Age': '-', 'Position': 'Investor Relations Contact', 'Date': '-'}, {'Name': 'Ahmed Al-Maktoum', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Chairman', 'Date': '2011-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Hesham Al-Qassim', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2011-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Hesham Al-Qassim', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2019-07-31'}, {'Name': 'Hesham Al-Qassim', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2011-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Hesham Al-Qassim', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee Chair', 'Date': '2011-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Hesham Al-Qassim', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Finance Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Salem Mohammed Ibrahim Obaidalla', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-19'}, {'Name': 'Salem Mohammed Ibrahim Obaidalla', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': ''}, {'Name': 'Salem Mohammed Ibrahim Obaidalla', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-22'}, {'Name': 'Salem Mohammed Ibrahim Obaidalla', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2019-02-22'}, {'Name': 'Salem Mohammed Ibrahim Obaidalla', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2019-02-22'}, {'Name': 'Ali Al-Owais', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee', 'Date': '2013-03-26'}, {'Name': 'Ali Al-Owais', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee', 'Date': '2013-03-26'}, {'Name': 'Ali Al-Owais', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee', 'Date': '2013-03-26'}, {'Name': 'Ali Al-Owais', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2013-03-26'}, {'Name': 'Buti Al-Mulla', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Compensation Committee Chair', 'Date': '2011-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Buti Al-Mulla', 'Age': '57 year', 'Position': 'Nominating Committee Chair', 'Date': '2011-08-31'}, {'Name': 'Mohamed Al-Hussaini', 'Age': '48 year', 'Position': 'Executive Committee', 'Date': '2011-06-24'}, {'Name': 'Jassim Mohammed Al Ali', 'Age': '- year', 'Position': 'Audit Committee Chair', 'Date': '2022-02-22'}, {'Name': 'H.
