SoftBank-backed Ola Electric aims to raise $734 million in India's biggest IPO this year,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/softbank-backed-ola-electric-aims-to-raise-734-million-in-indias-biggest-ipo-this-year.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107428712-1718293652888-gettyimages-1234690305-AFP_9L69QR.jpeg?v=1718293715&w=884&h=442&vtcrop=y,2 days ago - CNBC News,2024-07-29,"Indian e-scooter maker Ola Electric said on Monday it aimed to raise $734 million in this year's biggest domestic IPO, with foreign investors eyeing the offering after the SoftBank-backed firm was valued at a sharply lower $4 billion.
The IPO comes amid a stock market boom in India, as more than 150 companies have raised nearly $5 billion through public listings between January and July, nearly double the figure of the corresponding period last year, LSEG data shows.
The first IPO by an Indian electric vehicle maker will let investors bet on a clean energy push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, as well as firms from Tata Motors and TVS to Hyundai Motor.
""Tesla is for the West and Ola for the rest,"" has become a catchphrase best linked to the firm's chairman, Bhavish Aggarwal, who is betting big on cleaner vehicles, after having often publicly criticized gasoline and diesel vehicles.
With e-scooter prices starting at around $900, Ola Electric has become the biggest player in a country where adoption of clean vehicles is still low, but rising rapidly. It has 46% of the e-scooter market despite slashing sales goals last year.
A term sheet showed the IPO, which will run from Aug. 1 to Aug. 6, puts a value of $4 billion on the company, which sold its first scooter in 2021.
That valuation is about 25% lower than Ola's last funding round in September, led by Singapore's investment firm Temasek which valued the EV maker at $5.4 billion.
The lower figure stems from a correction in the valuation of global tech companies, while Ola also wants to attract participants to the stock offering, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The IPO is set to draw investor bids from Fidelity, Nomura and Norges Bank at the $4 billion valuation, as well as several Indian mutual funds, sources who asked not to be identified told Reuters.
In the IPO, Ola will issue new shares to raise $657 million while existing investors offload their stake of about $77 million to IPO investors, the term sheet showed.
The company unveiled the price band of 72 rupees to 76 rupees ($0.86-$0.91) in an advertisement in the Financial Express newspaper, with a discount of 7 rupees a share for some eligible employees.
Aggarwal and investors such as SoftBank and Matrix Partners will sell part of their stakes in the IPO.
Monday's newspaper ad showed 10% of the IPO will be reserved for retail investors, with proceeds going to fund capital expenditure and research and development efforts.
Aggarwal also had plans to start selling an electric car in 2024, but Reuters reported they have been suspended to let the company focus on e-scooters. It also plans a foray into electric motorcycles.
The company, which disrupted the two-wheeler market forcing a pivot by incumbents such as TVS, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto, reported a loss of 15.84 billion rupees ($189 million) before tax in the fiscal year 2023-24."

Lineage closes up more than 3% in market’s largest IPO of 2024,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/25/lineage-goes-public-largest-ipo-2024.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108011798-17219219432024-07-25t151946z_216025317_rc2e29azbta0_rtrmadp_0_lineage-ipo.jpeg?v=1721922056&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,6 days ago - CNBC News,2024-07-25,"Lineage, the largest temperature-controlled warehouse real estate investment trust (REIT) in the world, closed up more than 3% in its Nasdaq Stock Market debut on Thursday, after going public under the ticker symbol ""LINE.""
Lineage priced 57 million shares at $78 apiece on Wednesday, near the top of its initial $70 to $82 target range. The company raised $4.4 billion at an implied valuation over $18 billion, making it the largest public offering since chip designer Arm's $4.8 billion listing last September and more than twice the size of cruise operator Viking Holdings, which went public in May.
Lineage is a four-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company that ranked No. 46 on this year's list.
One of the biggest factors in the company's success is its aggressive acquisition strategy.
""We started with one warehouse and we've done 116 acquisitions to turn Lineage into what it is today,"" co-founder and co-executive chairman Adam Forste said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday morning before shares started trading.
In the last year alone, Lineage has acquired Grupo Fuentes, Burris Logistics, Kennedy Transportation and Harnes. The Burris acquisition alone gave Lineage eight new facilities.
""So many families who we've bought companies from rolled equity into Lineage as part of their transaction, so they're celebrating here today with us as well,"" Forste said, adding that the company's namesake is derived from the network, or lineage, of family-owned warehouses that he and co-founder Kevin Marchetti have brought into the fold.
Lineage has amassed over 480 facilities, totaling roughly 2.9 billion cubic feet of capacity across countries in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. These locations create a global network of cold-storage facilities, reducing supply chain food waste and its environmental impact.
Food loss happens at every level of the supply chain, with an estimated $600 billion worth of food going to waste during or just after harvest. That ever-growing amount of waste currently accounts for about 11% of the world's emissions – making it one of the biggest environmental issues contributing to climate change.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo were the lead underwriters for Lineage's offering.

StubHub delays IPO until after Labor Day,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/stubhub-punts-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107400590-1712945079686-gettyimages-1150127526-urn_newsml_dpa_com_20090101_190615-99-654803-2.jpeg?v=1720800477&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 weeks ago - CNBC News,2024-07-12,"StubHub is delaying a potential initial public offering until after Labor Day, according to a person familiar with the deal.
The online ticketing service had been eyeing a summer IPO, aiming for a valuation of at least $16.5 billion. However, stagnant market conditions have led the company to postpone its efforts. There haven't been any major consumer IPOs in recent months and, therefore, it has been difficult to gauge investor appetite.
The company has been working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs over the past two years on the IPO, CNBC previously reported. StubHub declined to comment.
StubHub has been a longtime player in the ticketing industry since its launch in 2000. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but reacquired by its co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for $4 billion through his new company Viagogo.
Online ticketing rival SeatGeek has also been evaluating a potential IPO this year, according to media reports. In early June, Bloomberg reported Citigroup and Wells Fargo joined Morgan Stanley on the company's planned listing. The news outlet reported SeatGeek was seeking a valuation above $1.35 billion.
If StubHub does enter the public market, it will trade alongside competitors Vivid Seats and Live Nation. Vivid Seats has a market cap of $1.5 billion and Live Nation is valued at just under $23 billion.
The live events marketplace has bloomed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, as people have gravitated toward out-of-home entertainment and experiences. Record-breaking concert ticket sales, such as those seen for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour, have fueled revenues for ticketing companies across the board."
"Hong Kong's IPO market is finally starting to turn around, consulting firm EY says",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/ey-hong-kongs-ipo-market-is-set-to-improve-over-the-next-five-years.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108001260-1719986543474-gettyimages-2158666618-vcg111503310652.jpeg?v=1719986586&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,0 months ago - CNBC News,2024-07-03,"BEIJING — The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday.
""I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,"" Chan said. ""I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.""
High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years.
EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings.
Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai.
""We are seeing a reversing trend,"" he told CNBC. ""We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.""
The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline — which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.
""Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2.  We expect to see many HKSE listings,"" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday.
Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. ""Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly."" 
In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change.
Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is ""quite satisfactory.""
He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries.
""As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,"" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country.
Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China — up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years.
Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs.
""I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,"" Chan said.
Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report.
In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 — a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.
Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications — a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan.
""The pipeline is building up nicely,"" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. ""All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,"" she added.
""What we need is a strong pipeline,"" EY's Chan said. ""We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.""
Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY.
""The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,"" Chan said. ""These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.""
Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.
He said those will likely be medium-sized — between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) — but added he expects better market momentum in 2025.
Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups.
Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm.
U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.
As for IPOs of China-based companies in the U.S., EY's Chan said he expects current scrutiny on the listings to be ""temporary,"" although data security rules would remain a hurdle.
In early 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission formalized new rules that require domestic companies to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas. A China-based company with more than 1 million users must pass Beijing's cybersecurity review to list overseas.
""As time goes on, when people are more familiar with the Chinese [securities regulator] approval process and they are more become comfortable with geopolitical tensions, more of the large companies ... would consider [the] U.S. market as their final destination,"" Chan said.
""When the time comes I think the institutional investors would be interested in these sizeable Chinese companies, as they pretty much want to make money.""
He declined to comment on specific IPOs, and said certain high-profile listing plans are ""isolated incidents.""
Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, which delisted from New York in 2021, has denied reports it plans to list in Hong Kong next year. Fast-fashion company Shein, which does most of its manufacturing in China, is trying to list in London following criticism in the U.S., according to a CNBC report."
"U.S. law firm Dechert weighs shuttering offices in Hong Kong, Beijing: Reuters",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/dechert-weighs-shuttering-offices-in-hong-kong-beijing-reuters.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107173586-1672816947887-gettyimages-1243950317-yuen-hongkong221013_npffG.jpeg?v=1719800202&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-30,"U.S.-founded law firm Dechert is considering closing its offices in Hong Kong and Beijing, becoming the latest foreign firm to scale back in Greater China, two people said, amid a prolonged capital market downturn and growing Sino-U.S. tensions.
Dechert has more than 20 employees in its Hong Kong office, 14 of whom are lawyers, including four partners, according to its website and one of the people. Its Beijing office houses only three lawyers, as per the website.
There are no other China offices listed on the global law firm's website.
Some of the impacted employees were notified earlier this month about a potential office closure, said the people, who have knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The firm, which has about 1,000 lawyers globally, has since been in discussions with several employees in Hong Kong and Beijing, in particular lawyers, about a potential relocation to Singapore, said one of the people.
If the move from China is finalized, Dechert's Asia footprint will be limited to Singapore, which has 14 lawyers including six partners.
It was not immediately clear what would be the effective date of closure of the offices, and whether the firm has started notifying its clients about the move.
Dechert representatives in the U.S. did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The move comes as a growing number of U.S. and other global law firms have been rethinking or reducing their presence in China amid growing pressures on foreign businesses, economic uncertainties, muted deal activities, and geopolitical tensions.
New government rules on data privacy and cybersecurity were among the reasons cited by Dentons last year when the global law firm ended its combination with China's Dacheng, an 8,000-lawyer firm.
Several other large U.S. law firms have also announced closures of some of their China offices or scaled down their offerings in the world's second-largest economy since last year.
Morrison & Foerster said last week that it is winding down its Beijing office as its lease there ends later this year. It said most of its work in China is already being handled by lawyers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
Sidley Austin said in May that it will shutter its Shanghai office, relocate staff and consolidate its China operations in Hong Kong and Beijing by September.
Dechert's gross global revenues grew by just 0.4% to $1.294 billion last year, while profits per equity partner sank 1.2% year-on-year at the firm, according to The American Lawyer magazine.
Dechert said in May last year that it was laying off 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals, equivalent to 5% of its global workforce.
Many major law firms went on a hiring spree globally in 2021 and early 2022, capitalizing on a record-breaking boom in corporate deal making.
However, they have leaned on job cuts to adjust to a decline in demand for legal services since last year as rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears have soured some companies' appetites for deals and other legal work.
In Hong Kong, Dechert earlier this year axed the whole corporate offering team which had about four lawyers including one partner, as a market downturn and sluggish IPOs darken prospects, said one of the people and another person with direct knowledge."
"Tech founders are shunning IPOs after extended market lull, survey finds",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tech-founders-are-shunning-ipos-after-extended-market-lull-techstars.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107353630-1704285928831-107353630-1704285865401-gettyimages-1895737802-US_STOCKS.jpg?v=1710533605&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-28,"Silicon Valley is known for producing tech businesses that start in garages and turn into massive publicly traded companies ubiquitously known across the globe. From Oracle and Microsoft to Google and Facebook, the public markets are responsible for turning ambitious tech founders into billionaires.
But the appeal of the IPO is waning, according to a survey published this week from startup accelerator Techstars. Of the 1,550 entrepreneurs surveyed by Techstars, only 15% said their long-term goal is an IPO. That's down from 16% a year earlier.
Following an extended bull market in high-growth software and internet stocks, the tech IPO market collapsed in 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates, which pushed investors out of risk, slashed valuations and led many later-stage companies to delay their plans to go public. 
The prior year was a record period for new offerings, with companies including Roblox, Robinhood, Rivian and UiPath hitting the market. There have been scant few notable tech IPOs in the past two and a half years.
""In combination with the lack of confidence that IPOs will bounce back in short order, this year's data further underlines the trend that startups are staying private for longer, and IPOs are out of favor with the vast majority of early-stage entrepreneurs,"" Techstars said in its report.
For 34% of entrepreneurs surveyed, the preference is to get acquired by a publicly traded company, down from 36% last year, while 30% indicated their goal is to remain private or independent, up from 28% in the prior report.
Investment banks have been gearing up for a rebound. 
Colin Stewart, the Global Head of Technology Equity Capital Markets at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC in April that ""the IPO market's back,"" predicting that 10 to 15 tech companies might go public by the end of the year. Stewart cited high priced and well traded IPOs as ""bod[ing] well for the future."" 
Stewart's comments came after Reddit went public in March, becoming the first major social media company to hold an IPO since Pinterest in 2019. Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure companies, went public the same week, followed by data-management company Rubrik in April. 
Prior to that, there was a brief jump in activity in September, when chip designer Arm, grocery delivery company Instacart and cloud software vendor Klaviyo debuted. 
However, in comparison to the pre-2022 stretch, it's been mostly quiet for new tech companies on Wall Street. Uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in November is pointing to a dearth of deals for the remainder of the year. 
""We have the upcoming election, which is not helping the market in H2,"" Athena Theodorou, head of software banking in the Europe region at UBS, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""We do expect the market to remain muted in H2,"" Theodorou said, though she said that in Europe the IPO market has started to show signs of life.

Shein confidentially files for London IPO as U.S. listing stalls,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/shein-files-for-london-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107413924-1715606370233-gettyimages-2150274388-europapress_5918123_shein_sign_during_its_opening_at_abc_ser.jpeg?v=1719237369&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-24,"Shein, the fast fashion giant with links to China, has confidentially filed for a public listing in London as it faces backlash in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.
The person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the discussions, which are private.
The company had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in November but began looking toward London after it failed to win the support of American lawmakers.
Elected officials in the U.S. have repeatedly expressed concerns about the use of forced labor in Shein's supply chain and its use of a U.S. tax law exemption known as de minimis. Under the provision, packages valued at less than $800 are not charged import duties and aren't subject to the same levels of oversight from U.S. customs, which is tasked with screening packages to ensure items from banned regions don't come into the country.
Shein would still prefer to go public in the U.S., people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, and its filing in London doesn't mean that an IPO will happen there. Shein had previously sought China's approval to go public in the U.S. It's unclear if Beijing has signed off on the London listing.
Shein declined to comment to CNBC.
Reuters first reported that Shein had confidentially filed in London.
Shein, which was founded in China, has gone to great lengths to establish itself as a ""global"" company, moving its headquarters to Singapore in 2021. Still, the vast majority of its supply chain is still based in China, and the fact that it needed to seek Beijing's approval to go public in the U.S. means regulators there view it as a Chinese company — and could exert control over its operations and data.
Shein's London filing marks another twist in the company's so-far long road to a public markets debut. It crashed onto the U.S. fashion scene during the Covid-19 pandemic and won over consumers with its ability to quickly offer the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. It's been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based competitors, which have ceded market share to the digital upstart and struggled to match its speed.
As Shein's prominence in the U.S. grew, so did its ambitions to go public. It began waging a U.S. charm offensive as it sought to win the approval of lawmakers and the retail industry, but those efforts have not yet succeeded. Shein has applied for membership in the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, multiple times and has repeatedly been rejected, CNBC reported.
It's found itself caught in the crossfire of a tense geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing. American lawmakers, concerned about the influence companies with Chinese links can have on the U.S. economy, ramped up their scrutiny of Shein after it filed to go public. Some elected officials at the federal and state level have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the company's listing because they say it would violate a U.S. law that bans the import of products made from the Xinjiang region in China, where the government has faced accusations of genocide against the Uyghur ethnic group.
Shein has acknowledged to CNBC that raw materials from banned regions have been found in its supply chain, but previous tests show that it's done a better job, on average, of ridding such materials from its garments than the industry overall.
In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shein was considering a London IPO after the SEC told the retailer that its listing wouldn't be accepted unless it made its filing public — a request that experts told the Journal was unusual. Typically, companies file to go public confidentially so they can protect sensitive information surrounding their operations and financials as regulators review the filing.
Even so, Shein's executive chairman insisted that its ambitions to go public are about transparency, not about raising capital.
""Most companies seek to go public for liquidity reasons,"" Donald Tang told the Journal. ""We seek to go public to embrace scrutiny and public diligence.""

The company, last valued at $66 billion, confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. in November. Since then, it has faced resistance as it tries to join the American retail sphere, including through numerous rejected attempts to become a member of the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, CNBC previously reported.
The e-commerce upstart filed to go public while becoming a household name in the U.S. by offering low prices and a facility to offer new styles quickly. The company is poised to take major market share from U.S. retailers, particularly Gap, TJX Companies and Macy's, according to UBS data from last year, and continues to challenge Target, Walmart and Amazon.
But as political resistance to its U.S. IPO mounts, Shein is seemingly shifting gears, as it reportedly prepares to confidentially file for a £50 billion offering in London in the coming weeks. The company likely would have preferred to list in the U.S., because the offering could bring a higher valuation than in the U.K., said Angelo Bochanis, an IPO analyst at Renaissance Capital, which provides pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs. 
But its path hasn't been easy, as federal and state officials call on the Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize or even block the initial public offering in the U.S.
""Scrutinizing companies with high-profiles and roots in China is very politically in-vogue right now in the United States,"" Bochanis said.
A London IPO could, in theory, be easier than a U.S. offering, according to Bochanis. With the British parliament dissolved and the London Stock Exchange ""desperate for big wins"" as it suffers an IPO drought, Shein could circumvent some of the hurdles that it might have otherwise faced, he said.
If Shein's London IPO succeeds, it is unlikely to keep pursuing a U.S. offering, said University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who studies IPOs.
Not all China-linked companies are getting tangled in the webs of rising political tensions. Chinese electric vehicle company Zeekr went public in the U.S. last month. It became one of the first prominent Chinese companies to do so in the U.S. even as the Biden administration has increasingly cracked down on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
Shein is ""one of the few"" China-tied companies that have gained deep brand awareness with U.S. consumers, Bochanis said.
The size of the potential offering, and the long, high-profile process accompanying it, have helped to make Shein an attractive target for politicians from both parties who want to look tough on Beijing-linked companies.
Shein was founded in China and has since moved its headquarters to Singapore. But a good chunk of the company's supply chain is still based in the country.
In December, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent a letter to Shein seeking information about the company's user data collection and its relationship to the Chinese government, calling a potential link to Beijing a ""serious risk for e-commerce, consumer safety and people's data privacy and security.""
The panel sent a similar letter to TikTok, the popular social media platform owned by China-based parent ByteDance.
The Chinese Communist Party can by law request any Chinese-owned company to share information on its customers, according to George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson. While Shein is headquartered offshore, its manufacturing ties in China and reports that it sought Beijing's permission to go public in the U.S. raised concerns among U.S. officials about what data it could share with the Chinese government.
That relationship helped to spark a proposed U.S. ban on TikTok. Legislation that Congress passed last month aims to force the platform to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19 or cease all activity in the country.
ByteDance and several creators on the platform have filed lawsuits to block the bill.
While Shein does not have access to the magnitude of data that a social media giant like TikTok has, the proposed ban has raised more doubts about a U.S. IPO for the company.
""[Congress] just showed us that if a particular Chinese-owned company is perceived to be posing a threat, they can unify and pass a law, and that's much stronger than an executive order or presidential order,"" said Antonia Tzinova, a national security attorney at Holland & Knight.
The political scrutiny beyond data privacy may prove more difficult for Shein to overcome.
The retailer has long been criticized for its alleged use of forced labor in its supply chain and poor working conditions for its employees.
In 2021, the United States passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which prohibits companies that manufacture goods in the Xinjiang region of China notorious for its Uyghur detention camps from selling in the U.S. Although U.S. government agencies claim Shein's supply chain has links to the Xinjiang region, the company doesn't manufacture its own goods and instead uses China-based micro-manufacturers that make materials tougher to track.
Shein has repeatedly denied the forced-labor allegations, saying it implements a system to support compliance with the U.S. law within the company.
The company has also come under fire for its use of U.S. customs law loopholes.
Because the company doesn't import its products in bulk to sell from a U.S. warehouse and instead ships on an order-by-order basis, it's exempt from some of the heaviest U.S. import taxes. Rivals have criticized this practice as giving Shein an unfair competitive advantage.

China talks up support for IPOs. Investors are watching the speed of approval,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/china-talks-up-support-for-ipos-investors-are-watching-the-speed-of-approval.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106668476-15977683532020-08-18t094644z_966918122_rc29gi95b8sg_rtrmadp_0_usa-spac-wallstreet.jpeg?v=1664533041&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-21,"BEIJING — Chinese authorities this week announced new policy for supporting venture capital, raising hopes for faster approvals of initial public offerings in the near future.
A once-burgeoning ecosystem of investment capital and startups in China has slowed drastically in the last three years amid increased regulatory scrutiny.
In one of the latest efforts to shore up the industry, China's top executive body, the State Council, late on Wednesday published high-level measures for ""promoting the high-quality development of venture capital.""
""Everything is going to depend on the implementing regulations,"" said Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster.
""It's positive the government at the central level has realized there is a problem,"" Ellis said. ""At least with respect to investments in technology, venture capital can be a positive force in the market in China that frankly can help China compete with the U.S. in the tech race.""
In terms of actions to watch, Ellis said that ""really what we're looking for as far as IPOs, is if the approvals start coming out at a quicker pace.""
""Venture capital investors are not going to make investments unless they can see a reasonably clear path to an exit,"" she said, noting that has not been case for the past year or so.
The new policy included a section on expanding exit channels for venture capital, with an emphasis on supporting companies with technological breakthroughs. The measures also called for implementing a management system for overseas listings and smoothing the exit channels for venture capital funds not denominated in yuan.
""The real bottleneck for overseas listings is the overseas IPO process and foreign exchange rules,"" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law.
The pace of both onshore and overseas public offerings has slowed. Investors, especially those who put U.S. dollars into China-based venture capital funds, have preferred IPOs in the U.S. as the largest and most liquid market.
Looking ahead, ""the market is watching the speed of U.S. IPO approvals,"" Ming Liao, founding partner of Prospect Avenue Capital, said in Chinese translated by CNBC.
Chinese authorities tightened their scrutiny and introduced new rules for overseas IPOs after ride-hailing company Didi went ahead with a U.S. listing in 2021 despite reportedly being under government investigation. Separately, the U.S. has increased its scrutiny of U.S. capital going into China, especially military-related entities.
Previously, lack of regulation also resulted in a number of high-profile cases of fraud involving China-based IPOs in the U.S.
Morrison Foerster's Ellis cautioned how the new policy encouraged businesses and research institutions broadly to participate in venture capital.
""Unfortunately I think if companies that are not professional investors start doing this and are doing this because they are encouraged by the government, it may just be more damaging to the market in the long run because they're going to lose money and it's going to stain the venture capital market in China,"" Ellis said. ""You need professionals doing this.""
The China Securities Regulatory Commission has increased fines for misleading investors and clarified requirements for overseas IPOs. Last year it announced updated rules, effective March 31, 2023, that said domestic companies need to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas.
Since then, 73 companies have listed in the U.S. and 85 in Hong Kong, Fang Xinghai, vice chair of the commission, said during a conference Wednesday, according to state media.
The IPO processing speed hasn't been fast enough and will be accelerated, Fang said in the report, adding the commission supports mainland Chinese companies to list overseas, especially in Hong Kong.
Fast-fashion giant Shein, which has tried to distance itself from its Chinese roots, has reportedly shifted its plans for a U.S. listing to one in London amid regulatory scrutiny.
China has also sought to develop its domestic stock markets, which are only about 30 years old.
Morgan Stanley equity analysts noted separate comments Wednesday from Wu Qing, head of China's securities regulator, that capital markets should increase their targeted support for businesses in line with the country's efforts to develop new technologies.
""We think it implies capital markets could welcome more diverse IPO candidates as long as they can demonstrate innovation and drive productivity growth, although IPO volume might remain low near term given higher standards are also in place,"" the Morgan Stanley report said.
Wu took over as CSRC head in February after a volatile downturn in mainland stocks. Markets have since recouped losses for the year so far.
The new policy also called for supporting international investment institutions to establish yuan-denominated funds.
""If foreign funds were able to set up RMB funds more easily, then there is money that wants to do that,"" Ellis said.
""There are a lot of China-focused funds that are headquartered in Asia,"" she said. ""They are USD funds but their management companies also want to manage onshore RMB funds because they feel like they can actually raise money in China for China investments, whereas raising USD from the U.S. and potentially Europe for China-focused funds is now very difficult."""
Google-backed Tempus AI pops by as much as 15% in Nasdaq debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/14/google-backed-tempus-ai-pops-by-as-much-as-15percent-in-nasdaq-debut.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107429397-1718389064229-GQC5pYiXoAAQDBc.jpg?v=1718389177&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-14,"In this article
Tempus AI, a health-care diagnostics company that uses AI to interpret medical tests to help physicians provide more accurate treatment for their patients, rose by as much as 15% in its Nasdaq Stock Market debut on Friday, after going public under the ticker symbol ""TEM."" 
Tempus AI priced 11.1 million shares at $37 apiece on Thursday, at the top of its initial $35 to $37 target range. The company raised $410 million at an implied valuation of just over $6 billion. Its early gains took the company to a valuation as high as $7 billion, but it closed its first day of trading up nearly 9%, for a market cap of roughly $6.65 billion.
Tempus believes that AI can help guide therapy selection and treatment decisions, in conjunction with the patient's doctor. It generated total revenue of $531.8 million in 2023 and a net loss of $214.1 million.
""We're on a really good trajectory,"" Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Friday morning before shares started trading. ""As revenues have been growing quickly, we're not investing all that gross profit dollar growth back into the business. We're generating improved leverage every quarter,"" he said, adding that he expects the company to be both cash flow and EBITDA positive within the next year.
Tempus AI is applying some of the most heavily-funded technology concepts — artificial intelligence and data analysis — to building a better, more informed medical profession. The lack of diagnostic testing early in the Covid-19 outbreak was an example of how a system as mature as our health-care infrastructure can still be unprepared for the future.
The Chicago-based company said in its IPO filing, ""we endeavor to unlock the true power of precision medicine by creating Intelligent Diagnostics through the practical application of artificial intelligence, or AI, in healthcare. Intelligent Diagnostics use AI, including generative AI, to make laboratory tests more accurate, tailored, and personal. We make tests intelligent by connecting laboratory results to a patient's own clinical data, thereby personalizing the results."" 
The two-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company's at-home testing kit was quickly rolled out during the pandemic, but the problem Tempus is attacking is not Covid-specific. The Tempus idea came to Lefkofsky, also known for co-founding Groupon, during frustration with the health-care system after his wife received a breast cancer diagnosis. Oncology is a primary focus and the company's genomic tests are designed to understand tumors at the molecular level and tailor treatment to individuals.
Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Allen & Company were the lead underwriters for Tempus AI's offering.
Investors include Google, Baillie Gifford, Franklin Templeton, NEA and T. Rowe Price, according to PitchBook data.

Computing firm Raspberry Pi pops 38% in rare London market debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/11/rasperry-pi-ipo-computing-firm-to-raise-211-million.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107221049-1680709415419-gettyimages-518513764-BPS01_Raspberry_Pi_OC_9.jpeg?v=1715769591&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-11,"Shares of Raspberry Pi surged Tuesday, rallying by more than 38%, as the British computing startup sought to raise some £166 million ($211.2 million) from its initial public offering.
Shares of Raspberry Pi begun ""conditional dealing"" on Tuesday with a full open trade due to begin on Friday. Shares rose to 388 pence by the close after the firm, which makes tiny single-board computers, priced its shares at 280 pence apiece. The listing is seen as a rare win for London's main stock exchange which has struggled to attract technology listings.
Based on the initial pricing of its shares, the company was valued at around £541.6 million.
The Raspberry Pi offering comprises 45.9 million ordinary shares sold by the company's existing majority shareholder, Raspberry Pi Mid Co Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It also includes 2.13 million ordinary shares sold by other shareholders, along with 11.23 million freshly issued shares.
If there is more demand, a so-called overallotement option will allow the Raspberry Pi Foundation to issue another 4.6 million shares. If the overallotment option is exercised, the final offer size will be  £178.9 million.
Raspberry CEO Eben Upton established the company in 2012 to make computing more accessible to young people. Its single board computers can be used to power a whole range of uses.
While it initially gained traction with hobbyists, the company says that 72% of its unit sales target the industrial market, where it is used, for example, in factories.
In 2023, Raspberry Pi posted revenues of $265.8 million, up 41% year-on-year from 2022.
A number of high-profile industry staples back the company, including Arm and Sony. Last year, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation, invested an undisclosed amount in the British startup.
While small relative to other tech firms, the Raspberry Pi IPO could breathe life into the struggling London bourse, which has been snubbed by technology firms in favor or listings in other parts of Europe, and particularly in the U.S.
Softbank-owned chip designer Arm, which is headquartered in the U.K., chose to list in the U.S last year."

An alternative trading platform CEO wants to revolutionize private equity investing to help mitigate a stalling initial public offering market.
So, Forge Global's Kelly Rodriques partnered with Accuidity to launch the Forge Accuidity Private Market Index this spring.
The ultimate goal: Give more investors easier access to unicorns.
""This is a major financial innovation that's just happening now,"" Rodriques told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""There is a future … where index products and other financial innovations are making it possible for every investor to participate.""
The Forge Accuidity Private Market Index consists of 60 private companies including SpaceX, Stripe and Epic Games, according to Forge Global's website. But as of right now, access is still closed off to everyday investors. 
""Today, the regulations are such that you need to have a minimum net worth to meet the threshold of being accredited,"" Rodriques said. 
That means even with Forge's new initiative, only institutional investors and individuals with a high net worth can purchase shares. But anyone, accredited or not, can sell their shares of private companies on the platform. However, those same companies still have a right to refuse transactions on the platform.  
Rodriques hopes as interest in private investing increases, those regulations will shift. 
""We see a world very soon, where nonaccredited investors can come into a basket of index stocks and make a bet across 60 to 70 names, thematics, the same way you do in the public market, and that will really open it up,"" he said.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco begins massive share sale to raise around $12 billion,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/saudi-aramco-begins-massive-share-sale-to-raise-around-12-billion.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107356582-1704890071155-gettyimages-1689520927-widak-24thworl230918_np5Ua.jpeg?v=1717275990&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-02,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco commenced its secondary public offering on Sunday as the company looks to raise in the region of $12 billion.
Books opened early Sunday morning offering a price range between 26.70 ($7.12) and 29 Saudi riyals per share. Aramco on Thursday announced its plan to sell 1.545 billion shares — a stake of around 0.64%. At the midpoint of that range, the sale would total around $11.5 billion but could eventually reach up to $13.1 billion.
Four more banks were added to the share offering, Reuters reported on Sunday, including Credit Suisse Saudi Arabia and BNP Paribas. 
The share sale is the company's second, after Aramco first entered public markets in 2019 and offered 1.5% of the company to investors. That sale raised a record $29.4 billion, history's largest IPO to date. Aramco is the world's largest oil company in terms of both daily crude production and market cap.
The latest offering comes at an opportune time for the kingdom, which in early May chalked its sixth consecutive quarterly budget deficit amid high spending on multitrillion-dollar megaprojects and simultaneous lower oil revenues.
But economists note that even a financial windfall from another Aramco stock sale will barely scratch the surface of the costs of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 diversification plans, which — including giga projects like entirely new cities and all of the infrastructure that entails — are projected to cost more than a trillion dollars.

The Saudi state and its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, own the vast majority of Aramco, with just 1.5% of the company traded publicly on the Tadawul, the kingdom's stock exchange, following its first-ever public offering in 2019.
The sale raised a record $29.4 billion, still history's largest IPO to date. Aramco is the world's largest oil company in terms of both daily crude production and market cap.
The reported new sale would come at an opportune time for the kingdom, which in early May chalked its sixth consecutive quarterly budget deficit amid high spending on multitrillion-dollar megaprojects and simultaneous lower oil revenues.
Aramco refrained from providing comment when contacted by CNBC.
If the offering goes ahead, it would relieve some financial pressure on the kingdom, at least in the near term, the Journal reported. Saudi Arabia in May forecast a budget deficit of 79 billion Saudi riyals ($21 billion) for the year, as well as a fiscal deficit in 2025 and 2026.The stock sale could still be delayed or canceled, the Journal reported.
