UK launches new rules for listings in bid to boost growth for London's stock exchange,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/uk-launches-new-listing-rules-in-bid-to-boost-london-stock-exchange.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108003880-1720621944820-gettyimages-1246744992-Vuk_Valcic_City_020223_1.jpeg?v=1720621997&w=884&h=442&vtcrop=y,4 hours ago - CNBC News,2024-07-11 06:57:07.680065,"The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced Thursday new rules for the country's stock market listings in a bid to boost growth following a slow down in IPOs.
The new rules — which come into effect from July 29 — will ensure the U.K.'s listing system is more in line with those in other markets, and will make it simpler and more streamlined, the FCA said in a statement.
The measures mark the biggest change to the listing regime in over three decades, the FCA said. ""They aim to support a wider range of companies to issue their shares on a UK exchange, increasing opportunities for investors,"" the regulator added.
One key change is the removal of the 'premium' and 'standard' listing segments. Instead there will be one overall category for equity share listings, which has been named 'commercial companies.'
Premium listings previously had additional requirements compared to standard ones. Some of these will be carried over and now applied to all listings, while others have been scrapped.  
""The new rules remove the need for votes on significant or related party transactions and offer flexibility around enhanced voting rights. Shareholder approval for key events, like reverse takeovers and decisions to take the company's shares off an exchange, is still required,"" the FCA said.
Some rules around eligibility for listings will also change, such as the removal of a requirement for companies to provide track records of their revenue.
The rules are a positive move for the U.K. IPO market, but could have gone further, Chris Haynes, corporate partner at law firm Gibson Dunn told CNBC in emailed comments.
""The move to a single listing category with streamlined eligibility criteria, and to disclosure-based continuing obligations, is one of a number of important initiatives which, together, should lead to more UK IPO activity,"" he said.
""In my view the FCA could have created further flexibility in some areas, such as in relation to dual class share structures, however overall it's a good outcome,"" Haynes added.
The new rules come at a time when the European listings market, and the U.K.'s in particular, have slumped. Major tech companies have recently favored the U.S. for their listings, including British chip designer Arm which chose to list on New York's Nasdaq last year.
Euronext reported 64 equity listings on its platform last year, a significant drop from the 83 listings it welcomed in 2022.
The new rules were made in response to the 2021 U.K. Listing Review report which showed that the number of listed companies in the UK has declined by about 40% since 2008, and that only 5% of global IPOs between 2015 and 2020 took place in the U.K.

"Hong Kong's IPO market is finally starting to turn around, consulting firm EY says",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/ey-hong-kongs-ipo-market-is-set-to-improve-over-the-next-five-years.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108001260-1719986543474-gettyimages-2158666618-vcg111503310652.jpeg?v=1719986586&w=412&h=442&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000000,"BEIJING — The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday.
""I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,"" Chan said. ""I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.""
High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years.
EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings.
Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai.
""We are seeing a reversing trend,"" he told CNBC. ""We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.""
The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline — which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.
""Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2.  We expect to see many HKSE listings,"" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday.
Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. ""Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly."" 
In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change.
Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is ""quite satisfactory.""
He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries.
""As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,"" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country.
Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China — up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years.
Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs.
""I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,"" Chan said.
Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report.
In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 — a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.
Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications — a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan.
""The pipeline is building up nicely,"" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. ""All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,"" she added.
""What we need is a strong pipeline,"" EY's Chan said. ""We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.""
Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY.
""The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,"" Chan said. ""These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.""
Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.
He said those will likely be medium-sized — between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) — but added he expects better market momentum in 2025.
Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups.
Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm.
U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.
As for IPOs of China-based companies in the U.S., EY's Chan said he expects current scrutiny on the listings to be ""temporary,"" although data security rules would remain a hurdle.
In early 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission formalized new rules that require domestic companies to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas. A China-based company with more than 1 million users must pass Beijing's cybersecurity review to list overseas.
""As time goes on, when people are more familiar with the Chinese [securities regulator] approval process and they are more become comfortable with geopolitical tensions, more of the large companies ... would consider [the] U.S. market as their final destination,"" Chan said.
""When the time comes I think the institutional investors would be interested in these sizeable Chinese companies, as they pretty much want to make money.""
He declined to comment on specific IPOs, and said certain high-profile listing plans are ""isolated incidents.""
Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, which delisted from New York in 2021, has denied reports it plans to list in Hong Kong next year. Fast-fashion company Shein, which does most of its manufacturing in China, is trying to list in London following criticism in the U.S., according to a CNBC report."
"U.S. law firm Dechert weighs shuttering offices in Hong Kong, Beijing: Reuters",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/dechert-weighs-shuttering-offices-in-hong-kong-beijing-reuters.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107173586-1672816947887-gettyimages-1243950317-yuen-hongkong221013_npffG.jpeg?v=1719800202&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000000,"U.S.-founded law firm Dechert is considering closing its offices in Hong Kong and Beijing, becoming the latest foreign firm to scale back in Greater China, two people said, amid a prolonged capital market downturn and growing Sino-U.S. tensions.
Dechert has more than 20 employees in its Hong Kong office, 14 of whom are lawyers, including four partners, according to its website and one of the people. Its Beijing office houses only three lawyers, as per the website.
There are no other China offices listed on the global law firm's website.
Some of the impacted employees were notified earlier this month about a potential office closure, said the people, who have knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The firm, which has about 1,000 lawyers globally, has since been in discussions with several employees in Hong Kong and Beijing, in particular lawyers, about a potential relocation to Singapore, said one of the people.
If the move from China is finalized, Dechert's Asia footprint will be limited to Singapore, which has 14 lawyers including six partners.
It was not immediately clear what would be the effective date of closure of the offices, and whether the firm has started notifying its clients about the move.
Dechert representatives in the U.S. did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The move comes as a growing number of U.S. and other global law firms have been rethinking or reducing their presence in China amid growing pressures on foreign businesses, economic uncertainties, muted deal activities, and geopolitical tensions.
New government rules on data privacy and cybersecurity were among the reasons cited by Dentons last year when the global law firm ended its combination with China's Dacheng, an 8,000-lawyer firm.
Several other large U.S. law firms have also announced closures of some of their China offices or scaled down their offerings in the world's second-largest economy since last year.
Morrison & Foerster said last week that it is winding down its Beijing office as its lease there ends later this year. It said most of its work in China is already being handled by lawyers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
Sidley Austin said in May that it will shutter its Shanghai office, relocate staff and consolidate its China operations in Hong Kong and Beijing by September.
Dechert's gross global revenues grew by just 0.4% to $1.294 billion last year, while profits per equity partner sank 1.2% year-on-year at the firm, according to The American Lawyer magazine.
Dechert said in May last year that it was laying off 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals, equivalent to 5% of its global workforce.
Many major law firms went on a hiring spree globally in 2021 and early 2022, capitalizing on a record-breaking boom in corporate deal making.
However, they have leaned on job cuts to adjust to a decline in demand for legal services since last year as rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears have soured some companies' appetites for deals and other legal work.
In Hong Kong, Dechert earlier this year axed the whole corporate offering team which had about four lawyers including one partner, as a market downturn and sluggish IPOs darken prospects, said one of the people and another person with direct knowledge."
"Tech founders are shunning IPOs after extended market lull, survey finds",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tech-founders-are-shunning-ipos-after-extended-market-lull-techstars.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107353630-1704285928831-107353630-1704285865401-gettyimages-1895737802-US_STOCKS.jpg?v=1710533605&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-06-28 00:00:00.000000,"Silicon Valley is known for producing tech businesses that start in garages and turn into massive publicly traded companies ubiquitously known across the globe. From Oracle and Microsoft to Google and Facebook, the public markets are responsible for turning ambitious tech founders into billionaires.
But the appeal of the IPO is waning, according to a survey published this week from startup accelerator Techstars. Of the 1,550 entrepreneurs surveyed by Techstars, only 15% said their long-term goal is an IPO. That's down from 16% a year earlier.
Following an extended bull market in high-growth software and internet stocks, the tech IPO market collapsed in 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates, which pushed investors out of risk, slashed valuations and led many later-stage companies to delay their plans to go public. 
The prior year was a record period for new offerings, with companies including Roblox, Robinhood, Rivian and UiPath hitting the market. There have been scant few notable tech IPOs in the past two and a half years.
""In combination with the lack of confidence that IPOs will bounce back in short order, this year's data further underlines the trend that startups are staying private for longer, and IPOs are out of favor with the vast majority of early-stage entrepreneurs,"" Techstars said in its report.
For 34% of entrepreneurs surveyed, the preference is to get acquired by a publicly traded company, down from 36% last year, while 30% indicated their goal is to remain private or independent, up from 28% in the prior report.
Investment banks have been gearing up for a rebound. 
Colin Stewart, the Global Head of Technology Equity Capital Markets at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC in April that ""the IPO market's back,"" predicting that 10 to 15 tech companies might go public by the end of the year. Stewart cited high priced and well traded IPOs as ""bod[ing] well for the future."" 
Stewart's comments came after Reddit went public in March, becoming the first major social media company to hold an IPO since Pinterest in 2019. Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure companies, went public the same week, followed by data-management company Rubrik in April. 
Prior to that, there was a brief jump in activity in September, when chip designer Arm, grocery delivery company Instacart and cloud software vendor Klaviyo debuted. 
However, in comparison to the pre-2022 stretch, it's been mostly quiet for new tech companies on Wall Street. Uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in November is pointing to a dearth of deals for the remainder of the year. 
""We have the upcoming election, which is not helping the market in H2,"" Athena Theodorou, head of software banking in the Europe region at UBS, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""We do expect the market to remain muted in H2,"" Theodorou said, though she said that in Europe the IPO market has started to show signs of life.

Human rights law firm Leigh Day has written to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to urge the regulator to refuse any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE, it said.
Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the FCA declined to comment.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein's potential London initial public offering would be a ""badge of shame"" for the London Stock Exchange because of the fast-fashion firm's ""questionable"" labor and human rights standards.
Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain's markets regulator in June, two sources told Reuters on Monday, kicking off the process for a potential London listing later this year.
The company has previously said it was investing in strengthening governance and compliance across its supply chain.

Webtoon Entertainment has priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its indicated range, seeking to raise about $315 million, the online comics platform said on Wednesday.
The company, majority-owned by South Korean tech giant Naver, priced its 15 million shares at $21 apiece, and had marketed the range of $18 to $21.
The IPO now values the Los Angeles, California-based company at $2.67 billion.
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore Group are the lead underwriters for the IPO.
Webtoon was founded in 2005 as a side project of CEO Junkoo Kim while he was working as a search engineer at Naver.
The company, whose roots are in Korea, is a storytelling platform that is home to thousands of titles across multiple genres including fantasy, action, romance, and horror.
Webtoon has about 170 million monthly active users in more than 150 countries around the world.
The company's offerings include Japanese web-comic and manga app Line Manga, web-novel platform Wattpad and Korean web-comic offering Naver Webtoon.
Certain funds and accounts managed by world's largest asset manager BlackRock had indicated an interest in buying up to $50 million worth of shares sold in the offering.
Separately, Naver's U.S. subsidiary Naver U.Hub had agreed to buy $50 million worth of shares of Webtoon in a concurrent private placement.
Webtoon's shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 27 under the symbol ""WBTN."""

The person was granted anonymity in order to speak freely about the discussions, which are private.
The company had confidentially filed for a U.S. initial public offering in November but began looking toward London after it failed to win the support of American lawmakers.
Elected officials in the U.S. have repeatedly expressed concerns about the use of forced labor in Shein's supply chain and its use of a U.S. tax law exemption known as de minimis. Under the provision, packages valued at less than $800 are not charged import duties and aren't subject to the same levels of oversight from U.S. customs, which is tasked with screening packages to ensure items from banned regions don't come into the country.
Shein would still prefer to go public in the U.S., people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC, and its filing in London doesn't mean that an IPO will happen there. Shein had previously sought China's approval to go public in the U.S. It's unclear if Beijing has signed off on the London listing.
Shein declined to comment to CNBC.
Reuters first reported that Shein had confidentially filed in London.
Shein, which was founded in China, has gone to great lengths to establish itself as a ""global"" company, moving its headquarters to Singapore in 2021. Still, the vast majority of its supply chain is still based in China, and the fact that it needed to seek Beijing's approval to go public in the U.S. means regulators there view it as a Chinese company — and could exert control over its operations and data.
Shein's London filing marks another twist in the company's so-far long road to a public markets debut. It crashed onto the U.S. fashion scene during the Covid-19 pandemic and won over consumers with its ability to quickly offer the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. It's been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based competitors, which have ceded market share to the digital upstart and struggled to match its speed.
As Shein's prominence in the U.S. grew, so did its ambitions to go public. It began waging a U.S. charm offensive as it sought to win the approval of lawmakers and the retail industry, but those efforts have not yet succeeded. Shein has applied for membership in the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, multiple times and has repeatedly been rejected, CNBC reported.
It's found itself caught in the crossfire of a tense geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Beijing. American lawmakers, concerned about the influence companies with Chinese links can have on the U.S. economy, ramped up their scrutiny of Shein after it filed to go public. Some elected officials at the federal and state level have called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to block the company's listing because they say it would violate a U.S. law that bans the import of products made from the Xinjiang region in China, where the government has faced accusations of genocide against the Uyghur ethnic group.
Shein has acknowledged to CNBC that raw materials from banned regions have been found in its supply chain, but previous tests show that it's done a better job, on average, of ridding such materials from its garments than the industry overall.
In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shein was considering a London IPO after the SEC told the retailer that its listing wouldn't be accepted unless it made its filing public — a request that experts told the Journal was unusual. Typically, companies file to go public confidentially so they can protect sensitive information surrounding their operations and financials as regulators review the filing.
Even so, Shein's executive chairman insisted that its ambitions to go public are about transparency, not about raising capital.
""Most companies seek to go public for liquidity reasons,"" Donald Tang told the Journal. ""We seek to go public to embrace scrutiny and public diligence.""

Golden Goose, known for its worn-looking trainers which have been made popular by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, was aiming for a market capitalization of up to 1.86 billion euros ($2 billion).
The ""current market backdrop is not the right environment to take the company public,"" the firm said in a Tuesday statement, adding that an IPO will be reassessed in due course.
The European Parliament elections and the calling of a general election in France impacted not only markets in Europe but the luxury sector in particular, Golden Goose said.
It stressed that the brand's IPO process had been ""engaged widely"" with investors. The first day of trading was due to take place on Friday.
France's far-right National Rally (RN) party won around 31% of the vote in the recent European Parliament elections, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap national election.
The record gains for the RN party sparked nationwide protests in France as demonstrators pushed back against rising nationalist sentiment. The French CAC 40 lost more than 6.2% last week to record its worst weekly loss since March 2022.
Golden Goose, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, announced last week that Invesco had committed 100 million euros to the listing as a cornerstone backer.

Tempus AI, a health-care diagnostics company that uses AI to interpret medical tests to help physicians provide more accurate treatment for their patients, rose by as much as 15% in its Nasdaq Stock Market debut on Friday, after going public under the ticker symbol ""TEM."" 
Tempus AI priced 11.1 million shares at $37 apiece on Thursday, at the top of its initial $35 to $37 target range. The company raised $410 million at an implied valuation of just over $6 billion. Its early gains took the company to a valuation as high as $7 billion, but it closed its first day of trading up nearly 9%, for a market cap of roughly $6.65 billion.
Tempus believes that AI can help guide therapy selection and treatment decisions, in conjunction with the patient's doctor. It generated total revenue of $531.8 million in 2023 and a net loss of $214.1 million.
""We're on a really good trajectory,"" Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Friday morning before shares started trading. ""As revenues have been growing quickly, we're not investing all that gross profit dollar growth back into the business. We're generating improved leverage every quarter,"" he said, adding that he expects the company to be both cash flow and EBITDA positive within the next year.
Tempus AI is applying some of the most heavily-funded technology concepts — artificial intelligence and data analysis — to building a better, more informed medical profession. The lack of diagnostic testing early in the Covid-19 outbreak was an example of how a system as mature as our health-care infrastructure can still be unprepared for the future.
The Chicago-based company said in its IPO filing, ""we endeavor to unlock the true power of precision medicine by creating Intelligent Diagnostics through the practical application of artificial intelligence, or AI, in healthcare. Intelligent Diagnostics use AI, including generative AI, to make laboratory tests more accurate, tailored, and personal. We make tests intelligent by connecting laboratory results to a patient's own clinical data, thereby personalizing the results."" 
The two-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company's at-home testing kit was quickly rolled out during the pandemic, but the problem Tempus is attacking is not Covid-specific. The Tempus idea came to Lefkofsky, also known for co-founding Groupon, during frustration with the health-care system after his wife received a breast cancer diagnosis. Oncology is a primary focus and the company's genomic tests are designed to understand tumors at the molecular level and tailor treatment to individuals.
Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Allen & Company were the lead underwriters for Tempus AI's offering.
Investors include Google, Baillie Gifford, Franklin Templeton, NEA and T. Rowe Price, according to PitchBook data.

Chinese-founded Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Shein, valued at $66 billion in a fundraising last year, started engaging with the London-based teams of its financial and legal advisors to explore a listing on the London Stock Exchange early this year, sources told Reuters in May.
The fast-fashion company stepped up preparations for its London listing after its attempt to float itself in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from U.S. lawmakers.
However, senior British lawmakers are also questioning Shein's suitability for a London listing and calling for greater scrutiny of the business. Shein, in response, has said it is strengthening governance and compliance."

Books opened early Sunday morning offering a price range between 26.70 ($7.12) and 29 Saudi riyals per share. Aramco on Thursday announced its plan to sell 1.545 billion shares — a stake of around 0.64%. At the midpoint of that range, the sale would total around $11.5 billion but could eventually reach up to $13.1 billion.
Four more banks were added to the share offering, Reuters reported on Sunday, including Credit Suisse Saudi Arabia and BNP Paribas. 
The share sale is the company's second, after Aramco first entered public markets in 2019 and offered 1.5% of the company to investors. That sale raised a record $29.4 billion, history's largest IPO to date. Aramco is the world's largest oil company in terms of both daily crude production and market cap.
The latest offering comes at an opportune time for the kingdom, which in early May chalked its sixth consecutive quarterly budget deficit amid high spending on multitrillion-dollar megaprojects and simultaneous lower oil revenues.
But economists note that even a financial windfall from another Aramco stock sale will barely scratch the surface of the costs of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 diversification plans, which — including giga projects like entirely new cities and all of the infrastructure that entails — are projected to cost more than a trillion dollars.

Sam Altman's nuclear energy company Oklo plunges 54% in NYSE debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/10/sam-altman-takes-nuclear-startup-oklo-public-to-power-ai-ambitions.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107361037-17055870662024-01-18t102403z_838136397_rc2ak5a86bbx_rtrmadp_0_davos-meeting.jpeg?v=1705594949&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-05-10 00:00:00.000000,"In this article
Sam Altman is now chairman of a public company. But it's not OpenAI.
On Friday, advanced nuclear fission company Oklo started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has yet to generate any revenue, went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called AltC Acquisition Corp., founded and led by Altman.
Under the ticker symbol ""OKLO,"" shares plummeted 54% on Friday to $8.45, valuing the company at about $364 million. Oklo received roughly $306 million in gross proceeds in the transaction, according to a release.
Oklo's business model is based on commercializing nuclear fission, the reaction that fuels all nuclear power plants. Instead of conventional reactors, the company aims to use mini nuclear reactors housed in A-frame structures. Its goal is to sell the energy to end users such as the U.S. Air Force and big tech companies.
Oklo is currently working to build its first small-scale reactor in Idaho, which could eventually power the types of data centers that OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies need to run their AI models and services.
Altman is co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which has been valued at over $80 billion by private investors. He's said that he sees nuclear energy as one of the best ways to solve the problem of growing demand for AI, and the energy that powers the technology, without relying on fossil fuels. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have also invested in nuclear plants in recent years.
""I don't see a way for us to get there without nuclear,"" Altman told CNBC in 2023. ""I mean, maybe we could get there just with solar and storage. But from my vantage point, I feel like this is the most likely and the best way to get there.""
In an interview with CNBC Thursday, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte confirmed that the company has yet to generate revenue and has no nuclear plants deployed at the moment. He said the company is targeting 2027 for its first plant to come online.
Going the SPAC route is risky. So-called reverse mergers became popular in the low-interest rate days of 2020 and 2021 when tech valuations were soaring and investors were looking for growth over profit. But the SPAC market collapsed in 2022 alongside rising rates and hasn't recovered.
AI-related companies, on the other hand, are the new darlings of Wall Street.
""SPACs haven't exactly had the best performances in the past couple of years, so for us to have sort of the outcome that we've had here is obviously a function of the work we put in, but also what we're building and also the fact that the market sees the opportunity sets here,"" said DeWitte, who co-founded the company in 2013. ""I think it's very promising on multiple fronts for [the] nuclear, AI, data center push, as well as the energy transition piece.""
The company has seen its fair share of regulatory setbacks. In 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission denied Oklo's application for an Idaho reactor. The company has been working on a new application, which it isn't aiming to submit to the NRC until early next year, DeWitte said, adding that it's currently in the ""pre-application engagement"" stage with the commission.
Altman got involved with Oklo while president of the startup incubator Y Combinator. Oklo went into the program in 2014 after an earlier meeting between Altman and DeWitte. In 2015, Altman invested in the company and became chairman.
It's not Altman's only foray into nuclear energy or other infrastructure that could power large-scale AI growth.
In 2021, Altman led a $500 million funding round in clean energy firm Helion, which is working to develop and commercialize nuclear fusion. Helion said in a blog post at the time that the capital would go toward its electricity demonstration generator, Polaris, ""which we expect to demonstrate net electricity from fusion in 2024.""
Altman didn't respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, Altman has also poured money into chip endeavors and investments that could help power the AI tools OpenAI builds.
Just before his brief ouster as OpenAI CEO in November, he was reportedly seeking billions of dollars for a chip venture codenamed ""Tigris"" to eventually compete with Nvidia.
Altman in 2018 invested in AI chip startup Rain Neuromorphics, based near OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters. The next year, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on Rain's chips. In December, the U.S. compelled a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm to sell its shares in Rain.
DeWitte told CNBC that the data center represents ""a pretty exciting opportunity.""
""What we've seen is there's a lot of interest with AI, specifically,"" he said. ""AI compute needs are significant. It opens the door for a lot of different approaches in terms of how people think about designing and developing AI infrastructure.""

The company will sell 21 million American depository shares to raise $441 million when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker ZK. The offering sits at the top of Zeekr's expected range of $18 to $21 a share, revealed in an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month.
Zeekr, which is backed by Chinese-based automotive group Geely, offers several luxury vehicle models, including an upscale sedan it began delivering in January. Geely will have more than 50% of the company's voting power after the IPO is complete.
""Through developing and offering next-generation premium BEVs and technology-driven solutions, we aspire to lead the electrification, intelligentization and innovation of the automobile industry,"" the company said in its SEC filing.
Zeekr could pose big competition for Tesla, which it reportedly outpaced in car sales in the province of Zhejiang, China, during the first three weeks of April. The province is where its parent company is based.
""Our sales gap with Tesla keeps on narrowing,"" Zeekr CEO Andy An told CNBC in an interview last month translated from Mandarin. He said the company plans to expand in Europe and Latin America this year, and it already sells vehicles in Sweden and the Netherlands.
According to the regulatory filing, Zeekr posted $7.28 billion in revenue for 2023 and a loss of $1.16 billion. The company also said it delivered 16,089 units in April.
Zeekr has said it plans to use the proceeds from the offering to develop more advanced battery electric vehicle technologies. Funds will also be used for selling and marketing purposes, such as growing its charging, along with general corporate needs.
Underwriters of the deal include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and China International Capital."

Following a long period of waiting, ""the IPO market's back.""
That's according to Colin Stewart, Morgan Stanley's global head of technology equity capital markets. In an interview with CNBC's ""TechCheck"" on Monday, Stewart said 10 to 15 more tech companies could go public before the end of 2024, with an even ""better year"" in store for 2025.
""It's been a long two and a half years, where we've had really nothing,"" Stewart said. Recent initial public offerings have priced high and traded well, which ""bodes well for the future,"" he added.
The lull began in 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risk, slashed tech valuations and led many tech companies to delay their plans to go public. It was a sharp contrast to the prior two years, which saw a record number of deals, including some at astronomical revenue multiples.
The IPO market cracked open in September, with the debuts of Instacart and Klaviyo. But the first real signs of momentum came last month, as Reddit became the first IPO for a major social media company since Pinterest in 2019 and data center connectivity chip company Astera Labs rocketed on its first day of trading.
Both stocks remain well above their IPO price, with Astera up about 145% as investors pour money into all things tied to artificial intelligence.
Morgan Stanley was the lead banker on the Reddit and Astera IPOs, positioning itself to collect roughly $37 million in total fees.
Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs led the latest venture-backed tech IPO last week. Rubrik, which develops data management software, jumped 16% in its New York Stock Exchange debut.
Stewart, who's had a hand in some of the largest offerings of the last few decades, said it usually takes six months to take an IPO to the finish line. That means companies currently considering an IPO are likely to hold off until 2025 to avoid intersecting with the U.S. presidential election in November, he said.
As for valuations, Stewart said the market has retreated from the peak days of 2021, and multiples in software and other parts of technology are now back to levels seen in 2018 and 2019. Stewart described 2021 as an ""amazing year"" but also ""exhausting.""
""What's happened in the last six to 12 months is that the market has gotten more comfortable with paying for growth again,"" Stewart said. ""We're not back to the levels of 2021, but we are getting a fair price for growth. And I think at those prices, you're starting to see companies say, 'You know, it's actually not bad to be a public company.'""
Still, the most valuable, late-stage companies have yet to hit the exits. That list includes Elon Musk's SpaceX along with Stripe and Databricks.
While Stewart said he'd ""love to take them public,"" he acknowledged that the challenge for the bigger names is ""they've got scale, they've got growth, investors are giving them lots of capital"" and they're investing toward the future.
""Right now the IPO is not on their near-term horizon, unfortunately,"" he said. ""But when it does come they'll be blockbuster.""
