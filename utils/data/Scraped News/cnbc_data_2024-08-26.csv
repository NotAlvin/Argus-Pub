"Hong Kong IPOs signal rebound as HKEX remains 'cautiously optimistic,' says CEO ",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/hong-kong-ipos-signal-rebound-amid-cautious-optimism-says-hkex-ceo-.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107150199-1668131442672-gettyimages-1297565616-vcg111314319231.jpeg?v=1724304682&w=884&h=442&vtcrop=y,4 days ago - CNBC News,2024-08-22,"In this article
Fundraising activity is rebounding in Hong Kong, reinforced by a strong IPO pipeline and additional follow-on fundraising, according to HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan.
Eighteen companies raised a combined 8.6 billion Hong Kong dollars ($1.1 billion) during the second quarter, representing a 50% quarter-on-quarter increase in new listings and a 79% increase in funds raised, according to the company's 2024 interim report.
Speaking to CNBC's Emily Chan Tan on Wednesday, Chan said there have already been 43 initial public offerings this year, with many more in the pipeline. 
""We have about 100 companies waiting to get listed, and it's a very diverse pipeline,"" she said. The interim results, along with the strength of the ""China story,"" have reinforced the exchange's ""cautiously optimistic"" outlook, she added.
Still, the chief executive argued it is ""too one dimensional"" to only evaluate Hong Kong's performance as a fundraising hub by IPOs.
""This year, we have [also] supported a lot of follow-on fundraising for companies that are listed on our exchange,"" Chan said, adding it has come in the form of additional follow-on financing and convertible bond issuance.  
""Altogether, these follow-on offerings have actually allowed companies listed on the exchange to raise over $20 billion, and that's significant,"" she said, adding that these companies have been able to attract investors from all around the world. 
U.S. investors have generally not participated in the largest deals in Hong Kong in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, Preqin, an alternative asset research firm, said in a June report.
For years, listing activity in the Asian financial hub city has struggled as Greater China grappled with high U.S. interest rates, slower economic growth, regulator scrutiny and elevated tensions with the U.S.
While HKEX could still do more to boost IPO activity, Chan said Hong has done quite well this year as a fundraising center. 
The exchange's results come as Beijing focuses on ""promoting the high-quality development of venture capital."" In April, China introduced capital market measures that support the listing of leading mainland companies in Hong Kong.
On Wednesday, HKEX reported that revenue and other income and profit both reached record second-quarter highs as trading volume in the securities market has risen since March. Second-quarter profit rose 9% year over year to HK$3.16 billion.
The results mark a strong start for Chan, who took over as HKEX's chief executive in March, and Carlson Tong Ka-Shing, who was appointed as the exchange's chairman on April 24."
"Tencent-backed Airwallex hits $500 million sales, aims to get IPO-ready by 2026",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/fintech-firm-airwallex-nears-500m-arr-plans-to-be-ipo-ready-by-2026.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108020298-1723642642043-gettyimages-2156723857-UK_FOUNDERS_FORUM.jpeg?v=1723702044&w=412&h=442&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-08-15,"Tencent-backed payments startup Airwallex has reached an annual revenue run rate of $500 million and will look to get ready for an initial public offering by 2026, CEO and co-founder Jack Zhang told CNBC in an exclusive interview.
""I think the next big milestone is the $1 billion,"" Zhang said, in response to a question on what's next for the Singapore-based firm after crossing the $500 million ARR milestone last month. ""Hopefully we can achieve that in 2026, or 2027. That is the goal.""
Run rate is a rough measure of how much revenue a company will make in a single year, based on monthly performance.
Zhang said that Airwallex has seen significant growth in its business in the last year, boosted by an expansion into developed markets such as the U.K., Europe, and North America.
In the Americas region, Airwallex grew its revenue by more than 300% year-over-year, according to figures shared with CNBC.
The U.K., Europe, and North America now account for more than 35% of Airwallex's overall transaction volumes, Zhang said.
When asked by CNBC about how he feels about the prospect of an IPO for his business, Zhang said: ""For us, it's just about getting IPO-ready in the next two years so that we have the choice to go or not go.""
""In 2025, we will prepare everything, and we can decide what to do after 2026,"" he added.
Airwallex crossed $100 billion in annual payment processing volumes this year, Zhang said, marking a 73% increase from last year. That came as the firm saw volumes growing across all its products, including payments, foreign exchange, payouts, and issuing.
""It took us nine years to cross the $100 billion mark,"" Zhang said. ""Hopefully it takes less than a year to get to $200 billion.""
Airwallex is currently lossmaking, though the company achieved profitability on a monthly basis in December 2023 and January this year.
Zhang said Airwallex isn't prioritizing making an annual net profit given its current pace of growth — but the firm has found ways to keep costs down.
Artificial intelligence, he said, is helping Airwallex make its employees more productive, while ultimately enabling the business to do more with less.
For example, he said that Airwallex is experimenting with 11x, a company that gives other businesses access to digital ""AI workers,"" to replace a significant portion of its sales development representatives (SDRs) — staff that focus on managing sales leads.
That pilot has only recently gone live, he said. But Zhang is so confident about the adoption of AI agents to take on the day-to-day work of SDRs, he thinks they could replace as much as 70% of those roles within its business with AI.
However, Zhang stressed that, while some roles will in effect be replaced with AI, most will be enhanced by the technology as Airwallex's sales teams will be able to increase their productivity.
For example, one SDR could manage five virtual SDRs.
Airwallex, which was most recently valued at $5.6 billion and is backed by Tencent, has been tipped as one of many major fintech IPO candidates.
But Zhang said that the mood in the financial technology industry is still primarily sour, for the moment.
""Investor perception is still not great and is still conservative,"" Zhang told CNBC. ""That's been going on for about three years. Nothing has really changed that much.""
However, he added: ""Fintech is a very large market. You see big companies like Nubank, Revolut, Stripe, Adyen continuing to do really well.""
""Investors will still pick the right companies to invest. We just need to make sure that Airwallex is the number one in global payments in the financial space,"" said Zhang."
"Indian EV startup Ola Electric pops 20% on debut, valuing firm at $4.8 billion",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/09/ola-electric-shares-rise-20percent-in-india-ipo-valuing-firm-at-4point8-billion.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108018454-1723195344139-gettyimages-2163874012-AVaishnav_Ola_Electric_Mobility_Limited_s_Initial_Public_Offer_IPO_press_conference_in_Mumbai.jpeg?v=1723195390&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,2 weeks ago - CNBC News,2024-08-09,"In this article
Shares of Ola Electric surged 20% in their market debut Friday, valuing the Indian electric vehicle startup at around $4.8 billion.
Ola Electric priced its shares at 76 rupees (91 cents) raising the company more than $730 million via the initial public offering in Mumbai. It is the biggest listing in India this year, according to Reuters.
By 3:52 p.m. local time, the shares were trading around 91.20 rupees.
The first-day surge comes as investors bet the company is poised to become a key player in India's electric vehicle market, at a time when the government is making moves to bolster the industry.
Ola Electric makes electric scooters and only shipped its first product 2½ years ago.
Two-wheelers are the most popular means of transport in India. By 2030, electric two-wheelers in particular are expected to account for 60% to 70% of all new scooter sales in India, according to McKinsey & Co. data.
This is the trend Ola Electric is trying to tap into as it prepares to deliver its first electric motorbike product in the second half of 2025.
The startup, founded by high-profile entrepreneur Bhavish Aggarwal, is positioning itself as a company that can do everything from design to manufacturing and batteries, much like Tesla does.
Currently, though, there does not appear to be plans for the company to expand into cars.
Ola Electric has some high-profile investors including SoftBank and Singapore's investment fund Temasek.
The company said it plans to use the IPO proceeds to pay down debts, for more research and development, and to support the expansion of its gigafactory battery plant.
While the company's revenue rose 90% year on year in the year ended March 31, its losses widened. The company is yet to turn a profit.
Aggarwal is also co-founder of Ola Cabs, a ride-hailing company in India."
Singapore's MAS establishes review group in bid to revive SGX development,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/mas-sets-up-review-group-in-bid-to-revive-its-sgx-development.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105995951-1561944910214gettyimages-520347272.jpeg?v=1636431599&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,3 weeks ago - CNBC News,2024-08-02,"In this article
Singapore's central bank established a task force to bolster the city-state's stock market.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that the review group will evaluate measures to ""improve the vibrancy"" of the Singapore equities market.
MAS said on Friday the panel will focus on addressing market challenges, fostering listings, and facilitating market revitalization, as well as enhancing regulations to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.
It said another key goal will be to identify methods for encouraging private sector participation, including from capital market intermediaries, investors and listed companies. 
The authority noted that a ""dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain,"" and that a liquid market enables companies to not only access capital as they expand, but also ""allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies.""
""Improving the attractiveness of Singapore's equities market can therefore enhance Singapore's standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub,"" the MAS said, adding that this will also ""[complement] Singapore's innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.""
Despite the Straits Times Index rising in three of the last four years including 2024, Singapore's stock market has been long plagued by thin trading volumes and more delistings than listings. This has led observers to describe the exchange as ""boring,"" ""unexciting"" and even once in 2021, a ""zombie"" bourse.
Turnover velocity at the SGX, a measure of market liquidity, stood at 36% for the whole of 2023, compared to 57.35% at the Hong Kong Exchange in the same period, and 103.6% at the Japan Exchange.
Analysts who previously spoke to CNBC outlined ways to revive interest in the SGX, including taking lessons from ""value up programs"" in Japan and South Korea.
The review group announced Friday will be chaired by Chee Hong Tat, Singapore's second minister of finance, and also include members like Koh Boon Hwee, the current chairman of the SGX.
The SGX said it welcomes the announcement and pledged to work closely with the review group.SGX RegCo, the regulatory arm of the exchange, will also aim to ""increase accountability, transparency and market discipline.""""Only a whole-of-ecosystem approach can lead to transformative actions that will give fresh impetus to improving liquidity and listings in Singapore's equities market,"" SGX said in a statement to CNBC."
"China securities official expected to lead Shenzhen stock exchange, Reuters reports",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/china-securities-official-expected-to-lead-shenzhen-stock-exchange.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107007807-1643337444460-gettyimages-1267455437-vcg111295937601.jpeg?v=1722559314&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,3 weeks ago - CNBC News,2024-08-01,"China is expected to appoint a senior securities official to head its second-largest bourse, four sources said, filling a role that has been vacant for the unusually long period of seven months as the securities regulator reshuffled its leadership.
Li Jizun, a civil servant who is now director of the general office at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is set to become general manager of the 27-trillion-yuan ($3.73-trillion) Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the sources said.
The role is the exchange's second most senior executive position and will see Li, whose appointment was finalized last week, move from the capital Beijing to the southern boom city of Shenzhen in the next few weeks, said two of the sources.
All the sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The CSRC and the Shenzhen exchange did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. Li could not be immediately reached for comment.
Born in 1974, Li has headed the regulator's general office since 2022, overseeing day-to-day operations and managing the administrative affairs of its top leadership, according to one of the sources familiar with the matter and Chinese media.
A former State Council official, Li began working at the CSRC in 2016, first in the research center mainly charged with studying and drafting strategies for capital markets and then heading the markets department overseeing infrastructure such as settlement and custody as well as risk management.
He was also deeply involved in the CSRC's capital market reform measures that include the launch of Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market and the pilot of a U.S.-style registration system for stock market floats, domestic media said.
Li's appointment comes after the exchange's former general manager, Sha Yan, was promoted as its Communist Party chief in December.
It is a common practice at state-owned institutions and firms for the party chief to also hold the position of chairman.
Sha had worked at the securities regulator for more than two decades before taking over at the Shenzhen exchange in mid-2020, after her predecessor Wang Jianjun was promoted to the party chief role before returning to the regulator as a vice chairman.
It is also common practice for CSRC officials to lead one of the main stock exchanges to strengthen their credentials and leadership capabilities before they return to the regulator in a more senior position.
Wang, also a CSRC veteran, served as the director of the general office before his tenure at the Shenzhen exchange.
Founded in 1990 in what was then a fishing village, the Shenzhen exchange has fast developed to become China's largest stock market after the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and one of the world's busiest markets for IPOs.
Shenzhen is a key tech and manufacturing hub, and its exchange has had a key role in raising funds for companies in the tech and healthcare sectors.
Last year, its start-up board ChiNext took the global crown for IPO volumes, with $16.4 billion raised, LSEG data shows.
The CSRC is in the midst of re-organizing its own leadership.
On Tuesday, the regulator promoted Li Ming, its law enforcement head, to the role of vice chairman, replacing Fang Xinghai, in a step that confirmed an earlier report by Reuters.
In February, Wu Qing, a former deputy party chief in the financial hub of Shanghai, took over as CSRC chairman when stock markets were near their lowest in five years and after several warnings against short-selling and other steps to arrest the slide by his predecessor Yi Huiman failed."
SoftBank-backed Ola Electric to raise $734m in India's biggest IPO this year,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/softbank-backed-ola-electric-aims-to-raise-734-million-in-indias-biggest-ipo-this-year.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107428712-1718293652888-gettyimages-1234690305-AFP_9L69QR.jpeg?v=1718293715&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,0 months ago - CNBC News,2024-07-29,"Indian e-scooter maker Ola Electric said on Monday it aimed to raise $734 million in this year's biggest domestic IPO, with foreign investors eyeing the offering after the SoftBank-backed firm was valued at a sharply lower $4 billion.
The IPO comes amid a stock market boom in India, as more than 150 companies have raised nearly $5 billion through public listings between January and July, nearly double the figure of the corresponding period last year, LSEG data shows.
The first IPO by an Indian electric vehicle maker will let investors bet on a clean energy push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, as well as firms from Tata Motors and TVS to Hyundai Motor.
""Tesla is for the West and Ola for the rest,"" has become a catchphrase best linked to the firm's chairman, Bhavish Aggarwal, who is betting big on cleaner vehicles, after having often publicly criticized gasoline and diesel vehicles.
With e-scooter prices starting at around $900, Ola Electric has become the biggest player in a country where adoption of clean vehicles is still low, but rising rapidly. It has 46% of the e-scooter market despite slashing sales goals last year.
A term sheet showed the IPO, which will run from Aug. 1 to Aug. 6, puts a value of $4 billion on the company, which sold its first scooter in 2021.
That valuation is about 25% lower than Ola's last funding round in September, led by Singapore's investment firm Temasek which valued the EV maker at $5.4 billion.
The lower figure stems from a correction in the valuation of global tech companies, while Ola also wants to attract participants to the stock offering, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The IPO is set to draw investor bids from Fidelity, Nomura and Norges Bank at the $4 billion valuation, as well as several Indian mutual funds, sources who asked not to be identified told Reuters.
In the IPO, Ola will issue new shares to raise $657 million while existing investors offload their stake of about $77 million to IPO investors, the term sheet showed.
The company unveiled the price band of 72 rupees to 76 rupees ($0.86-$0.91) in an advertisement in the Financial Express newspaper, with a discount of 7 rupees a share for some eligible employees.
Aggarwal and investors such as SoftBank and Matrix Partners will sell part of their stakes in the IPO.
Monday's newspaper ad showed 10% of the IPO will be reserved for retail investors, with proceeds going to fund capital expenditure and research and development efforts.
Aggarwal also had plans to start selling an electric car in 2024, but Reuters reported they have been suspended to let the company focus on e-scooters. It also plans a foray into electric motorcycles.
The company, which disrupted the two-wheeler market forcing a pivot by incumbents such as TVS, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto, reported a loss of 15.84 billion rupees ($189 million) before tax in the fiscal year 2023-24."

Lineage priced 57 million shares at $78 apiece on Wednesday, near the top of its initial $70 to $82 target range. The company raised $4.4 billion at an implied valuation over $18 billion, making it the largest public offering since chip designer Arm's $4.8 billion listing last September and more than twice the size of cruise operator Viking Holdings, which went public in May.
Lineage is a four-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company that ranked No. 46 on this year's list.
One of the biggest factors in the company's success is its aggressive acquisition strategy.
""We started with one warehouse and we've done 116 acquisitions to turn Lineage into what it is today,"" co-founder and co-executive chairman Adam Forste said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday morning before shares started trading.
In the last year alone, Lineage has acquired Grupo Fuentes, Burris Logistics, Kennedy Transportation and Harnes. The Burris acquisition alone gave Lineage eight new facilities.
""So many families who we've bought companies from rolled equity into Lineage as part of their transaction, so they're celebrating here today with us as well,"" Forste said, adding that the company's namesake is derived from the network, or lineage, of family-owned warehouses that he and co-founder Kevin Marchetti have brought into the fold.
Lineage has amassed over 480 facilities, totaling roughly 2.9 billion cubic feet of capacity across countries in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. These locations create a global network of cold-storage facilities, reducing supply chain food waste and its environmental impact.
Food loss happens at every level of the supply chain, with an estimated $600 billion worth of food going to waste during or just after harvest. That ever-growing amount of waste currently accounts for about 11% of the world's emissions – making it one of the biggest environmental issues contributing to climate change.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo were the lead underwriters for Lineage's offering.

StubHub delays IPO until after Labor Day,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/12/stubhub-punts-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107400590-1712945079686-gettyimages-1150127526-urn_newsml_dpa_com_20090101_190615-99-654803-2.jpeg?v=1720800477&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-07-12,"StubHub is delaying a potential initial public offering until after Labor Day, according to a person familiar with the deal.
The online ticketing service had been eyeing a summer IPO, aiming for a valuation of at least $16.5 billion. However, stagnant market conditions have led the company to postpone its efforts. There haven't been any major consumer IPOs in recent months and, therefore, it has been difficult to gauge investor appetite.
The company has been working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs over the past two years on the IPO, CNBC previously reported. StubHub declined to comment.
StubHub has been a longtime player in the ticketing industry since its launch in 2000. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but reacquired by its co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for $4 billion through his new company Viagogo.
Online ticketing rival SeatGeek has also been evaluating a potential IPO this year, according to media reports. In early June, Bloomberg reported Citigroup and Wells Fargo joined Morgan Stanley on the company's planned listing. The news outlet reported SeatGeek was seeking a valuation above $1.35 billion.
If StubHub does enter the public market, it will trade alongside competitors Vivid Seats and Live Nation. Vivid Seats has a market cap of $1.5 billion and Live Nation is valued at just under $23 billion.
The live events marketplace has bloomed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, as people have gravitated toward out-of-home entertainment and experiences. Record-breaking concert ticket sales, such as those seen for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour, have fueled revenues for ticketing companies across the board."

Dechert has more than 20 employees in its Hong Kong office, 14 of whom are lawyers, including four partners, according to its website and one of the people. Its Beijing office houses only three lawyers, as per the website.
There are no other China offices listed on the global law firm's website.
Some of the impacted employees were notified earlier this month about a potential office closure, said the people, who have knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The firm, which has about 1,000 lawyers globally, has since been in discussions with several employees in Hong Kong and Beijing, in particular lawyers, about a potential relocation to Singapore, said one of the people.
If the move from China is finalized, Dechert's Asia footprint will be limited to Singapore, which has 14 lawyers including six partners.
It was not immediately clear what would be the effective date of closure of the offices, and whether the firm has started notifying its clients about the move.
Dechert representatives in the U.S. did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The move comes as a growing number of U.S. and other global law firms have been rethinking or reducing their presence in China amid growing pressures on foreign businesses, economic uncertainties, muted deal activities, and geopolitical tensions.
New government rules on data privacy and cybersecurity were among the reasons cited by Dentons last year when the global law firm ended its combination with China's Dacheng, an 8,000-lawyer firm.
Several other large U.S. law firms have also announced closures of some of their China offices or scaled down their offerings in the world's second-largest economy since last year.
Morrison & Foerster said last week that it is winding down its Beijing office as its lease there ends later this year. It said most of its work in China is already being handled by lawyers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
Sidley Austin said in May that it will shutter its Shanghai office, relocate staff and consolidate its China operations in Hong Kong and Beijing by September.
Dechert's gross global revenues grew by just 0.4% to $1.294 billion last year, while profits per equity partner sank 1.2% year-on-year at the firm, according to The American Lawyer magazine.
Dechert said in May last year that it was laying off 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals, equivalent to 5% of its global workforce.
Many major law firms went on a hiring spree globally in 2021 and early 2022, capitalizing on a record-breaking boom in corporate deal making.
However, they have leaned on job cuts to adjust to a decline in demand for legal services since last year as rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears have soured some companies' appetites for deals and other legal work.

"Tech founders are shunning IPOs after extended market lull, survey finds",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tech-founders-are-shunning-ipos-after-extended-market-lull-techstars.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107353630-1704285928831-107353630-1704285865401-gettyimages-1895737802-US_STOCKS.jpg?v=1710533605&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-06-28,"Silicon Valley is known for producing tech businesses that start in garages and turn into massive publicly traded companies ubiquitously known across the globe. From Oracle and Microsoft to Google and Facebook, the public markets are responsible for turning ambitious tech founders into billionaires.
But the appeal of the IPO is waning, according to a survey published this week from startup accelerator Techstars. Of the 1,550 entrepreneurs surveyed by Techstars, only 15% said their long-term goal is an IPO. That's down from 16% a year earlier.
Following an extended bull market in high-growth software and internet stocks, the tech IPO market collapsed in 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates, which pushed investors out of risk, slashed valuations and led many later-stage companies to delay their plans to go public. 
The prior year was a record period for new offerings, with companies including Roblox, Robinhood, Rivian and UiPath hitting the market. There have been scant few notable tech IPOs in the past two and a half years.
""In combination with the lack of confidence that IPOs will bounce back in short order, this year's data further underlines the trend that startups are staying private for longer, and IPOs are out of favor with the vast majority of early-stage entrepreneurs,"" Techstars said in its report.
For 34% of entrepreneurs surveyed, the preference is to get acquired by a publicly traded company, down from 36% last year, while 30% indicated their goal is to remain private or independent, up from 28% in the prior report.
Investment banks have been gearing up for a rebound. 
Colin Stewart, the Global Head of Technology Equity Capital Markets at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC in April that ""the IPO market's back,"" predicting that 10 to 15 tech companies might go public by the end of the year. Stewart cited high priced and well traded IPOs as ""bod[ing] well for the future."" 
Stewart's comments came after Reddit went public in March, becoming the first major social media company to hold an IPO since Pinterest in 2019. Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure companies, went public the same week, followed by data-management company Rubrik in April. 
Prior to that, there was a brief jump in activity in September, when chip designer Arm, grocery delivery company Instacart and cloud software vendor Klaviyo debuted. 
However, in comparison to the pre-2022 stretch, it's been mostly quiet for new tech companies on Wall Street. Uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in November is pointing to a dearth of deals for the remainder of the year. 
""We have the upcoming election, which is not helping the market in H2,"" Athena Theodorou, head of software banking in the Europe region at UBS, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""We do expect the market to remain muted in H2,"" Theodorou said, though she said that in Europe the IPO market has started to show signs of life.

UK human rights group launches campaign to stop Shein's potential London IPO,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/uk-human-rights-group-launches-campaign-to-stop-sheins-potential-london-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107432238-1719236945716-gettyimages-2150177788-20090101240429-99-852802.jpeg?v=1719457162&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-06-26,"UK-based human rights group Stop Uyghur Genocide has launched a legal campaign to block Shein's potential London listing over concerns about its labor practices, a law firm representing the campaign group said on Wednesday.
Human rights law firm Leigh Day has written to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to urge the regulator to refuse any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE, it said.
Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the FCA declined to comment.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein's potential London initial public offering would be a ""badge of shame"" for the London Stock Exchange because of the fast-fashion firm's ""questionable"" labor and human rights standards.
Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain's markets regulator in June, two sources told Reuters on Monday, kicking off the process for a potential London listing later this year.
The company has previously said it was investing in strengthening governance and compliance across its supply chain.
The FCA has no investigation or enforcement powers relating to alleged breaches of legislation not within its remit, such as the Modern Slavery Act or tax legislation."
Experts say Shein's U.S. IPO is all but dead,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/shein-us-ipo-is-dead-experts-say.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107413923-1715606369703-gettyimages-2150178097-20090101240429-99-852616.jpeg?v=1715606470&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-06-21,"China-founded e-commerce company Shein's hopes of going public in the United States are growing slimmer by the day, according to experts, as rising tensions between Beijing and the U.S. roil business and trade.
The company, last valued at $66 billion, confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. in November. Since then, it has faced resistance as it tries to join the American retail sphere, including through numerous rejected attempts to become a member of the National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade association, CNBC previously reported.
The e-commerce upstart filed to go public while becoming a household name in the U.S. by offering low prices and a facility to offer new styles quickly. The company is poised to take major market share from U.S. retailers, particularly Gap, TJX Companies and Macy's, according to UBS data from last year, and continues to challenge Target, Walmart and Amazon.
But as political resistance to its U.S. IPO mounts, Shein is seemingly shifting gears, as it reportedly prepares to confidentially file for a £50 billion offering in London in the coming weeks. The company likely would have preferred to list in the U.S., because the offering could bring a higher valuation than in the U.K., said Angelo Bochanis, an IPO analyst at Renaissance Capital, which provides pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs. 
But its path hasn't been easy, as federal and state officials call on the Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize or even block the initial public offering in the U.S.
""Scrutinizing companies with high-profiles and roots in China is very politically in-vogue right now in the United States,"" Bochanis said.
A London IPO could, in theory, be easier than a U.S. offering, according to Bochanis. With the British parliament dissolved and the London Stock Exchange ""desperate for big wins"" as it suffers an IPO drought, Shein could circumvent some of the hurdles that it might have otherwise faced, he said.
If Shein's London IPO succeeds, it is unlikely to keep pursuing a U.S. offering, said University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who studies IPOs.
Not all China-linked companies are getting tangled in the webs of rising political tensions. Chinese electric vehicle company Zeekr went public in the U.S. last month. It became one of the first prominent Chinese companies to do so in the U.S. even as the Biden administration has increasingly cracked down on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
Shein is ""one of the few"" China-tied companies that have gained deep brand awareness with U.S. consumers, Bochanis said.
The size of the potential offering, and the long, high-profile process accompanying it, have helped to make Shein an attractive target for politicians from both parties who want to look tough on Beijing-linked companies.
Shein was founded in China and has since moved its headquarters to Singapore. But a good chunk of the company's supply chain is still based in the country.
In December, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent a letter to Shein seeking information about the company's user data collection and its relationship to the Chinese government, calling a potential link to Beijing a ""serious risk for e-commerce, consumer safety and people's data privacy and security.""
The panel sent a similar letter to TikTok, the popular social media platform owned by China-based parent ByteDance.
The Chinese Communist Party can by law request any Chinese-owned company to share information on its customers, according to George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson. While Shein is headquartered offshore, its manufacturing ties in China and reports that it sought Beijing's permission to go public in the U.S. raised concerns among U.S. officials about what data it could share with the Chinese government.
That relationship helped to spark a proposed U.S. ban on TikTok. Legislation that Congress passed last month aims to force the platform to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19 or cease all activity in the country.
ByteDance and several creators on the platform have filed lawsuits to block the bill.
While Shein does not have access to the magnitude of data that a social media giant like TikTok has, the proposed ban has raised more doubts about a U.S. IPO for the company.
""[Congress] just showed us that if a particular Chinese-owned company is perceived to be posing a threat, they can unify and pass a law, and that's much stronger than an executive order or presidential order,"" said Antonia Tzinova, a national security attorney at Holland & Knight.
The political scrutiny beyond data privacy may prove more difficult for Shein to overcome.
The retailer has long been criticized for its alleged use of forced labor in its supply chain and poor working conditions for its employees.
In 2021, the United States passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which prohibits companies that manufacture goods in the Xinjiang region of China notorious for its Uyghur detention camps from selling in the U.S. Although U.S. government agencies claim Shein's supply chain has links to the Xinjiang region, the company doesn't manufacture its own goods and instead uses China-based micro-manufacturers that make materials tougher to track.
Shein has repeatedly denied the forced-labor allegations, saying it implements a system to support compliance with the U.S. law within the company.
The company has also come under fire for its use of U.S. customs law loopholes.
Because the company doesn't import its products in bulk to sell from a U.S. warehouse and instead ships on an order-by-order basis, it's exempt from some of the heaviest U.S. import taxes. Rivals have criticized this practice as giving Shein an unfair competitive advantage.

China talks up support for IPOs. Investors are watching the speed of approval,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/china-talks-up-support-for-ipos-investors-are-watching-the-speed-of-approval.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106668476-15977683532020-08-18t094644z_966918122_rc29gi95b8sg_rtrmadp_0_usa-spac-wallstreet.jpeg?v=1664533041&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-06-21,"BEIJING — Chinese authorities this week announced new policy for supporting venture capital, raising hopes for faster approvals of initial public offerings in the near future.
A once-burgeoning ecosystem of investment capital and startups in China has slowed drastically in the last three years amid increased regulatory scrutiny.
In one of the latest efforts to shore up the industry, China's top executive body, the State Council, late on Wednesday published high-level measures for ""promoting the high-quality development of venture capital.""
""Everything is going to depend on the implementing regulations,"" said Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster.
""It's positive the government at the central level has realized there is a problem,"" Ellis said. ""At least with respect to investments in technology, venture capital can be a positive force in the market in China that frankly can help China compete with the U.S. in the tech race.""
In terms of actions to watch, Ellis said that ""really what we're looking for as far as IPOs, is if the approvals start coming out at a quicker pace.""
""Venture capital investors are not going to make investments unless they can see a reasonably clear path to an exit,"" she said, noting that has not been case for the past year or so.
The new policy included a section on expanding exit channels for venture capital, with an emphasis on supporting companies with technological breakthroughs. The measures also called for implementing a management system for overseas listings and smoothing the exit channels for venture capital funds not denominated in yuan.
""The real bottleneck for overseas listings is the overseas IPO process and foreign exchange rules,"" said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law.
The pace of both onshore and overseas public offerings has slowed. Investors, especially those who put U.S. dollars into China-based venture capital funds, have preferred IPOs in the U.S. as the largest and most liquid market.
Looking ahead, ""the market is watching the speed of U.S. IPO approvals,"" Ming Liao, founding partner of Prospect Avenue Capital, said in Chinese translated by CNBC.
Chinese authorities tightened their scrutiny and introduced new rules for overseas IPOs after ride-hailing company Didi went ahead with a U.S. listing in 2021 despite reportedly being under government investigation. Separately, the U.S. has increased its scrutiny of U.S. capital going into China, especially military-related entities.
Previously, lack of regulation also resulted in a number of high-profile cases of fraud involving China-based IPOs in the U.S.
Morrison Foerster's Ellis cautioned how the new policy encouraged businesses and research institutions broadly to participate in venture capital.
""Unfortunately I think if companies that are not professional investors start doing this and are doing this because they are encouraged by the government, it may just be more damaging to the market in the long run because they're going to lose money and it's going to stain the venture capital market in China,"" Ellis said. ""You need professionals doing this.""
The China Securities Regulatory Commission has increased fines for misleading investors and clarified requirements for overseas IPOs. Last year it announced updated rules, effective March 31, 2023, that said domestic companies need to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas.
Since then, 73 companies have listed in the U.S. and 85 in Hong Kong, Fang Xinghai, vice chair of the commission, said during a conference Wednesday, according to state media.
The IPO processing speed hasn't been fast enough and will be accelerated, Fang said in the report, adding the commission supports mainland Chinese companies to list overseas, especially in Hong Kong.
Fast-fashion giant Shein, which has tried to distance itself from its Chinese roots, has reportedly shifted its plans for a U.S. listing to one in London amid regulatory scrutiny.
China has also sought to develop its domestic stock markets, which are only about 30 years old.
Morgan Stanley equity analysts noted separate comments Wednesday from Wu Qing, head of China's securities regulator, that capital markets should increase their targeted support for businesses in line with the country's efforts to develop new technologies.
""We think it implies capital markets could welcome more diverse IPO candidates as long as they can demonstrate innovation and drive productivity growth, although IPO volume might remain low near term given higher standards are also in place,"" the Morgan Stanley report said.
Wu took over as CSRC head in February after a volatile downturn in mainland stocks. Markets have since recouped losses for the year so far.
The new policy also called for supporting international investment institutions to establish yuan-denominated funds.
""If foreign funds were able to set up RMB funds more easily, then there is money that wants to do that,"" Ellis said.
""There are a lot of China-focused funds that are headquartered in Asia,"" she said. ""They are USD funds but their management companies also want to manage onshore RMB funds because they feel like they can actually raise money in China for China investments, whereas raising USD from the U.S. and potentially Europe for China-focused funds is now very difficult."""

The company, which was valued at 2.23 billion Australian dollars ($1.49 billion) based on its initial public offering price of AU$22 per share, saw shares rise to as high as AU$30.28 on debut.
Shares of Guzman ended its first day of trading at AU$30, up 36.36%.

Shares of Raspberry Pi begun ""conditional dealing"" on Tuesday with a full open trade due to begin on Friday. Shares rose to 388 pence by the close after the firm, which makes tiny single-board computers, priced its shares at 280 pence apiece. The listing is seen as a rare win for London's main stock exchange which has struggled to attract technology listings.
Based on the initial pricing of its shares, the company was valued at around £541.6 million.
The Raspberry Pi offering comprises 45.9 million ordinary shares sold by the company's existing majority shareholder, Raspberry Pi Mid Co Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It also includes 2.13 million ordinary shares sold by other shareholders, along with 11.23 million freshly issued shares.
If there is more demand, a so-called overallotement option will allow the Raspberry Pi Foundation to issue another 4.6 million shares. If the overallotment option is exercised, the final offer size will be  £178.9 million.
Raspberry CEO Eben Upton established the company in 2012 to make computing more accessible to young people. Its single board computers can be used to power a whole range of uses.
While it initially gained traction with hobbyists, the company says that 72% of its unit sales target the industrial market, where it is used, for example, in factories.
In 2023, Raspberry Pi posted revenues of $265.8 million, up 41% year-on-year from 2022.
A number of high-profile industry staples back the company, including Arm and Sony. Last year, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation, invested an undisclosed amount in the British startup.
While small relative to other tech firms, the Raspberry Pi IPO could breathe life into the struggling London bourse, which has been snubbed by technology firms in favor or listings in other parts of Europe, and particularly in the U.S.
Softbank-owned chip designer Arm, which is headquartered in the U.K., chose to list in the U.S last year."

An alternative trading platform CEO wants to revolutionize private equity investing to help mitigate a stalling initial public offering market.
So, Forge Global's Kelly Rodriques partnered with Accuidity to launch the Forge Accuidity Private Market Index this spring.
The ultimate goal: Give more investors easier access to unicorns.
""This is a major financial innovation that's just happening now,"" Rodriques told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week. ""There is a future … where index products and other financial innovations are making it possible for every investor to participate.""
The Forge Accuidity Private Market Index consists of 60 private companies including SpaceX, Stripe and Epic Games, according to Forge Global's website. But as of right now, access is still closed off to everyday investors. 
""Today, the regulations are such that you need to have a minimum net worth to meet the threshold of being accredited,"" Rodriques said. 
That means even with Forge's new initiative, only institutional investors and individuals with a high net worth can purchase shares. But anyone, accredited or not, can sell their shares of private companies on the platform. However, those same companies still have a right to refuse transactions on the platform.  
Rodriques hopes as interest in private investing increases, those regulations will shift. 
""We see a world very soon, where nonaccredited investors can come into a basket of index stocks and make a bet across 60 to 70 names, thematics, the same way you do in the public market, and that will really open it up,"" he said.

Healthcare software firm Waystar raises $968 million in IPO ,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/healthcare-software-firm-waystar-raises-968-million-in-ipo-.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107381117-1709309019431-gettyimages-2050750214-_s1_0157_y7jyzton.jpeg?v=1717714465&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-06-06,"Waystar, a private equity-owned provider of software that helps hospitals and doctors' practices manage their finances, has raised $968 million in its initial public offering, the company said on Thursday.
The IPO of 45 million shares was priced at $21.50 a share, Waystar said. The pricing, which was in the middle of its indicated range, gives Waystar a fully diluted valuation of $3.69 billion.
Reuters reported the pricing earlier based on sources.
The progress in Waystar's IPO shows the market for new listings remains open after aluminum recycler Novelis pulled its stock market debut that would have raised as much as $945 million earlier this week.
Novelis blamed ""adverse market conditions,"" but sources close to the IPO effort said its owner, India's Hindalco Industries, could have gone ahead.
Companies have raised more than $15 billion this year via IPOs on U.S. exchanges, according to Dealogic, up sharply from about $9.1 billion at this point last year, the data show.
Waystar's major shareholders are buyout firm EQT, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and alternative investment firm Bain Capital. Following the IPO, EQT, CPPIB, and Bain will own about 29.2%, 22.3%, and 16.8% respectively.
Waystar was formed in 2017 through the merger of Navicure and ZirMed. The company develops payment software helping clients such as large hospital systems with the collection of bills from patients.
It reported a net loss of $51.3 million on revenue of $791 million for 2023, compared to a net loss of $51.5 million on revenue of $705 million in the previous year.
The company was valued at $2.7 billion in 2019 when Swedish private equity firm EQT and CPPIB acquired a majority stake in the company from Bain Capital.
Under EQT and Canadian pension giant CPPIB's ownership, Waystar has gained scale by acquiring some of its competitors, including eSolutions in 2020, which boosted its presence in the lucrative government health insurance market for the elderly, known as Medicare.
The company now works with 1 million healthcare providers and handles more than 2.5 billion transactions annually, according to its website.
Waystar will list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ""WAY"", with its shares expected to start trading on Friday.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group and Barclays are the lead underwriters for the IPO."
