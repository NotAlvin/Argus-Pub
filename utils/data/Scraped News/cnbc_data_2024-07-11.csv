Shares of Stellar Blade maker Shift Up surge almost 50% on trading debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/stellar-blade-maker-shift-up-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108004338-1720672745123-gettyimages-2160909423-SKOREA_SHIFT_UP.jpeg?v=1720672756&w=884&h=442&vtcrop=y,11 min ago - CNBC News,2024-07-11 13:18:01.611884,"Shares of South Korean video game developer Shift Up spiked almost 50% as the company debuted on the Kospi on Thursday.
The video game developer, which counts Chinese internet giant Tencent as its second largest shareholder, saw its shares climb as high as 89,500 South Korean won (about $64.89) apiece, a 49.17% gain from its initial public offering price of 60,000 won.
The company sold 7.25 million shares in its IPO, raising 435 billion won or about $315.56 million. At the offering price, the company would be valued at 3.48 trillion won, according to CNBC's calculations.
Demand was strong with institutional investors oversubscribing by almost 226 times the institutional allocation and the general offering over 341 times oversubscribed.
This is South Korea's largest IPO since the debut of maintenance and repair firm HD Hyundai Marine Solution in May.
Shift Up was established in 2013, but only gained prominence in 2024 after it released Stellar Blade, a PlayStation 5 exclusive that topped sales in the PlayStation stores of eight countries. It became the best selling game in the U.S. for April, despite being released on April 26.
In just two months, the game had sold over one million copies. Shift Up also makes the free-to-play game Goddess of Victory: Nikke, released in 2022.
The company reported sales of 168.6 billion won in 2023, up 155.2% year-on-year."
UK launches new listing rules in bid to boost growth for London's stock exchange,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/uk-launches-new-listing-rules-in-bid-to-boost-london-stock-exchange.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108003880-1720621944820-gettyimages-1246744992-Vuk_Valcic_City_020223_1.jpeg?v=1720621997&w=412&h=442&vtcrop=y,1 day ago - CNBC News,2024-07-10 00:00:00.000000,"The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced Thursday new rules for the country's stock market listings in a bid to boost growth following a slow down in IPOs.
The new rules — which come into effect from July 29 — will ensure the U.K.'s listing system is more in line with those in other markets, and will make it simpler and more streamlined, the FCA said in a statement.
The measures mark the biggest change to the listing regime in over three decades, the FCA said. ""They aim to support a wider range of companies to issue their shares on a UK exchange, increasing opportunities for investors,"" the regulator added.
One key change is the removal of the 'premium' and 'standard' listing segments. Instead there will be one overall category for equity share listings, which has been named 'commercial companies.'
Premium listings previously had additional requirements compared to standard ones. Some of these will be carried over and now applied to all listings, while others have been scrapped.  
""The new rules remove the need for votes on significant or related party transactions and offer flexibility around enhanced voting rights. Shareholder approval for key events, like reverse takeovers and decisions to take the company's shares off an exchange, is still required,"" the FCA said.
Some rules around eligibility for listings will also change, such as the removal of a requirement for companies to provide track records of their revenue.
The rules are a positive move for the U.K. IPO market, but could have gone further, Chris Haynes, corporate partner at law firm Gibson Dunn told CNBC in emailed comments.
""The move to a single listing category with streamlined eligibility criteria, and to disclosure-based continuing obligations, is one of a number of important initiatives which, together, should lead to more UK IPO activity,"" he said.
""In my view the FCA could have created further flexibility in some areas, such as in relation to dual class share structures, however overall it's a good outcome,"" Haynes added.
The new rules come at a time when the European listings market, and the U.K.'s in particular, have slumped. Major tech companies have recently favored the U.S. for their listings, including British chip designer Arm which chose to list on New York's Nasdaq last year.
Euronext reported 64 equity listings on its platform last year, a significant drop from the 83 listings it welcomed in 2022.
The new rules were made in response to the 2021 U.K. Listing Review report which showed that the number of listed companies in the UK has declined by about 40% since 2008, and that only 5% of global IPOs between 2015 and 2020 took place in the U.K.

"Hong Kong's IPO market is finally starting to turn around, consulting firm EY says",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/04/ey-hong-kongs-ipo-market-is-set-to-improve-over-the-next-five-years.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108001260-1719986543474-gettyimages-2158666618-vcg111503310652.jpeg?v=1719986586&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-07-03 00:00:00.000000,"BEIJING — The market for initial public offerings in Hong Kong is set to improve significantly over the next five years, starting in the second half of this year, George Chan, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday.
""I think it will take a couple years to go back to the peak [in 2021] but the trend is there,"" Chan said. ""I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.""
High U.S. interest rates, regulatory scrutiny, slower economic growth and U.S.-China tensions have constrained Greater China IPOs in the last three years.
EY said in a report that while the volume of IPOs and proceeds in the U.S. increased significantly in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period a year ago, mainland China and Hong Kong saw a sharp decline in listings.
Many of the macro trends are now starting to turn around, which can support more IPOs in Hong Kong, said Chan, who is based in Shanghai.
""We are seeing a reversing trend,"" he told CNBC. ""We are seeing more of these [U.S. dollar] funds, they are moving back to Hong Kong. The main reason is that Hong Kong has already factored in these uncertainties.""
The Hang Seng Index is up more than 5% year-to-date after four straight years of decline — which was the worst such losing streak in the history of the index, according to Wind Information.
""Our HK cap markets team is very busy and has a strong pipeline for H2.  We expect to see many HKSE listings,"" Marcia Ellis, global co-chair of private equity practice at Morrison Foerster in Hong Kong, said in an email Wednesday.
Many companies that were waiting for a listing in mainland China's A share market have decided to switch to one in Hong Kong, she said. ""Previously [China Securities Regulatory Commission] approval was slowing things down but recently our team has gotten CSRC approvals pretty quickly."" 
In June, China issued new measures to promote venture capital, and authorities spoke publicly about supporting IPOs, especially in Hong Kong. Investors and analysts said they are now looking at the speed of IPO approvals for signs of a significant change.
Chan said another supportive factor for Hong Kong IPOs is that many of the companies listed in the market are based in mainland China, where economic growth is ""quite satisfactory.""
He expects consumer companies could be among the near-term IPO beneficiaries.
""As the economy slowly recovers, a lot of people in China are willing to spend,"" he said, noting that was especially the case in less developed parts of the country.
Official national-level data have showed that retail sales are growing more slowly in China — up by just 3.7% in May from a year ago versus growth of nearly 10% or more in prior years.
Also significant for global asset allocation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks are pulling back from aggressive interest rate hikes. High rates have made Treasury bonds a more attractive investment for many institutions instead of IPOs.
""I would say if the interest rate can be further cut down, 1% maybe, that would have a significant effect on the IPO market,"" Chan said.
Hong Kong IPOs raised $1.5 billion during the first half of the year, a 34% drop from a year ago, EY said in a report released late last month. Back in 2021 and 2020, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saw nearly 100 or more IPOs a year raising tens of billions of dollars, according to the report.
In comparison, mainland China IPOs raised $4.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 — a drop of 85% from the year-ago period, according to EY.
Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said during a conference last week that so far this year, the Hong Kong exchange has received 73 new listing applications — a 50% increase compared to the second half of last year. She is not related to EY's George Chan.
""The pipeline is building up nicely,"" she said, noting about 110 IPOs in total are in line for a Hong Kong listing. ""All we need is a set of good market conditions so these things get to launch and price nicely,"" she added.
""What we need is a strong pipeline,"" EY's Chan said. ""We need an interested investor with the money to invest, and we need a good aftermarket performance.""
Hong Kong IPO returns are improving. The average first-day return of new listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2024 was 24%, far more than the average of 1% in the same period last year, according to EY.
""The aftermarket performance of Hong Kong IPOs has been doing quite good compared to the past five years,"" Chan said. ""These things added together are projecting an upward trend for the Hong Kong market [in the] next 5 years.""
Chan said he expects the number of deals to pick up in the second half of 2024.
He said those will likely be medium-sized — between 2 billion Hong Kong dollars to 5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($260 million to $640 million) — but added he expects better market momentum in 2025.
Slowing economic growth and geopolitical uncertainty have also weighed on early-stage investment into Chinese startups.
Total venture funding from foreign investors into Greater China deals plunged to $19 billion in 2023, down from $67 billion in 2021, according to Preqin, an alternative assets research firm.
U.S. investors have not participated in the largest deals in recent years, while investors from Greater China have remained involved, the firm said in a report last month.
As for IPOs of China-based companies in the U.S., EY's Chan said he expects current scrutiny on the listings to be ""temporary,"" although data security rules would remain a hurdle.
In early 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission formalized new rules that require domestic companies to comply with national security measures and the personal data protection law before going public overseas. A China-based company with more than 1 million users must pass Beijing's cybersecurity review to list overseas.
""As time goes on, when people are more familiar with the Chinese [securities regulator] approval process and they are more become comfortable with geopolitical tensions, more of the large companies ... would consider [the] U.S. market as their final destination,"" Chan said.
""When the time comes I think the institutional investors would be interested in these sizeable Chinese companies, as they pretty much want to make money.""
He declined to comment on specific IPOs, and said certain high-profile listing plans are ""isolated incidents.""
Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, which delisted from New York in 2021, has denied reports it plans to list in Hong Kong next year. Fast-fashion company Shein, which does most of its manufacturing in China, is trying to list in London following criticism in the U.S., according to a CNBC report."
"U.S. law firm Dechert weighs shuttering offices in Hong Kong, Beijing: Reuters",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/dechert-weighs-shuttering-offices-in-hong-kong-beijing-reuters.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107173586-1672816947887-gettyimages-1243950317-yuen-hongkong221013_npffG.jpeg?v=1719800202&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-06-30 00:00:00.000000,"U.S.-founded law firm Dechert is considering closing its offices in Hong Kong and Beijing, becoming the latest foreign firm to scale back in Greater China, two people said, amid a prolonged capital market downturn and growing Sino-U.S. tensions.
Dechert has more than 20 employees in its Hong Kong office, 14 of whom are lawyers, including four partners, according to its website and one of the people. Its Beijing office houses only three lawyers, as per the website.
There are no other China offices listed on the global law firm's website.
Some of the impacted employees were notified earlier this month about a potential office closure, said the people, who have knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.
The firm, which has about 1,000 lawyers globally, has since been in discussions with several employees in Hong Kong and Beijing, in particular lawyers, about a potential relocation to Singapore, said one of the people.
If the move from China is finalized, Dechert's Asia footprint will be limited to Singapore, which has 14 lawyers including six partners.
It was not immediately clear what would be the effective date of closure of the offices, and whether the firm has started notifying its clients about the move.
Dechert representatives in the U.S. did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The move comes as a growing number of U.S. and other global law firms have been rethinking or reducing their presence in China amid growing pressures on foreign businesses, economic uncertainties, muted deal activities, and geopolitical tensions.
New government rules on data privacy and cybersecurity were among the reasons cited by Dentons last year when the global law firm ended its combination with China's Dacheng, an 8,000-lawyer firm.
Several other large U.S. law firms have also announced closures of some of their China offices or scaled down their offerings in the world's second-largest economy since last year.
Morrison & Foerster said last week that it is winding down its Beijing office as its lease there ends later this year. It said most of its work in China is already being handled by lawyers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
Sidley Austin said in May that it will shutter its Shanghai office, relocate staff and consolidate its China operations in Hong Kong and Beijing by September.
Dechert's gross global revenues grew by just 0.4% to $1.294 billion last year, while profits per equity partner sank 1.2% year-on-year at the firm, according to The American Lawyer magazine.
Dechert said in May last year that it was laying off 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals, equivalent to 5% of its global workforce.
Many major law firms went on a hiring spree globally in 2021 and early 2022, capitalizing on a record-breaking boom in corporate deal making.
However, they have leaned on job cuts to adjust to a decline in demand for legal services since last year as rising interest rates, high inflation and recession fears have soured some companies' appetites for deals and other legal work.
In Hong Kong, Dechert earlier this year axed the whole corporate offering team which had about four lawyers including one partner, as a market downturn and sluggish IPOs darken prospects, said one of the people and another person with direct knowledge."
"Tech founders are shunning IPOs after extended market lull, survey finds",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/tech-founders-are-shunning-ipos-after-extended-market-lull-techstars.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107353630-1704285928831-107353630-1704285865401-gettyimages-1895737802-US_STOCKS.jpg?v=1710533605&w=412&h=206&vtcrop=y,1 week ago - CNBC News,2024-06-28 00:00:00.000000,"Silicon Valley is known for producing tech businesses that start in garages and turn into massive publicly traded companies ubiquitously known across the globe. From Oracle and Microsoft to Google and Facebook, the public markets are responsible for turning ambitious tech founders into billionaires.
But the appeal of the IPO is waning, according to a survey published this week from startup accelerator Techstars. Of the 1,550 entrepreneurs surveyed by Techstars, only 15% said their long-term goal is an IPO. That's down from 16% a year earlier.
Following an extended bull market in high-growth software and internet stocks, the tech IPO market collapsed in 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates, which pushed investors out of risk, slashed valuations and led many later-stage companies to delay their plans to go public. 
The prior year was a record period for new offerings, with companies including Roblox, Robinhood, Rivian and UiPath hitting the market. There have been scant few notable tech IPOs in the past two and a half years.
""In combination with the lack of confidence that IPOs will bounce back in short order, this year's data further underlines the trend that startups are staying private for longer, and IPOs are out of favor with the vast majority of early-stage entrepreneurs,"" Techstars said in its report.
For 34% of entrepreneurs surveyed, the preference is to get acquired by a publicly traded company, down from 36% last year, while 30% indicated their goal is to remain private or independent, up from 28% in the prior report.
Investment banks have been gearing up for a rebound. 
Colin Stewart, the Global Head of Technology Equity Capital Markets at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC in April that ""the IPO market's back,"" predicting that 10 to 15 tech companies might go public by the end of the year. Stewart cited high priced and well traded IPOs as ""bod[ing] well for the future."" 
Stewart's comments came after Reddit went public in March, becoming the first major social media company to hold an IPO since Pinterest in 2019. Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure companies, went public the same week, followed by data-management company Rubrik in April. 
Prior to that, there was a brief jump in activity in September, when chip designer Arm, grocery delivery company Instacart and cloud software vendor Klaviyo debuted. 
However, in comparison to the pre-2022 stretch, it's been mostly quiet for new tech companies on Wall Street. Uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in November is pointing to a dearth of deals for the remainder of the year. 
""We have the upcoming election, which is not helping the market in H2,"" Athena Theodorou, head of software banking in the Europe region at UBS, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""We do expect the market to remain muted in H2,"" Theodorou said, though she said that in Europe the IPO market has started to show signs of life.

Human rights law firm Leigh Day has written to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to urge the regulator to refuse any attempt by Shein to list on the LSE, it said.
Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the FCA declined to comment.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International UK said Shein's potential London initial public offering would be a ""badge of shame"" for the London Stock Exchange because of the fast-fashion firm's ""questionable"" labor and human rights standards.
Shein confidentially filed papers with Britain's markets regulator in June, two sources told Reuters on Monday, kicking off the process for a potential London listing later this year.
The company has previously said it was investing in strengthening governance and compliance across its supply chain.

Golden Goose, known for its worn-looking trainers which have been made popular by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, was aiming for a market capitalization of up to 1.86 billion euros ($2 billion).
The ""current market backdrop is not the right environment to take the company public,"" the firm said in a Tuesday statement, adding that an IPO will be reassessed in due course.
The European Parliament elections and the calling of a general election in France impacted not only markets in Europe but the luxury sector in particular, Golden Goose said.
It stressed that the brand's IPO process had been ""engaged widely"" with investors. The first day of trading was due to take place on Friday.
France's far-right National Rally (RN) party won around 31% of the vote in the recent European Parliament elections, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap national election.
The record gains for the RN party sparked nationwide protests in France as demonstrators pushed back against rising nationalist sentiment. The French CAC 40 lost more than 6.2% last week to record its worst weekly loss since March 2022.
Golden Goose, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, announced last week that Invesco had committed 100 million euros to the listing as a cornerstone backer.

The IPO of 45 million shares was priced at $21.50 a share, Waystar said. The pricing, which was in the middle of its indicated range, gives Waystar a fully diluted valuation of $3.69 billion.
Reuters reported the pricing earlier based on sources.
The progress in Waystar's IPO shows the market for new listings remains open after aluminum recycler Novelis pulled its stock market debut that would have raised as much as $945 million earlier this week.
Novelis blamed ""adverse market conditions,"" but sources close to the IPO effort said its owner, India's Hindalco Industries, could have gone ahead.
Companies have raised more than $15 billion this year via IPOs on U.S. exchanges, according to Dealogic, up sharply from about $9.1 billion at this point last year, the data show.
Waystar's major shareholders are buyout firm EQT, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and alternative investment firm Bain Capital. Following the IPO, EQT, CPPIB, and Bain will own about 29.2%, 22.3%, and 16.8% respectively.
Waystar was formed in 2017 through the merger of Navicure and ZirMed. The company develops payment software helping clients such as large hospital systems with the collection of bills from patients.
It reported a net loss of $51.3 million on revenue of $791 million for 2023, compared to a net loss of $51.5 million on revenue of $705 million in the previous year.
The company was valued at $2.7 billion in 2019 when Swedish private equity firm EQT and CPPIB acquired a majority stake in the company from Bain Capital.
Under EQT and Canadian pension giant CPPIB's ownership, Waystar has gained scale by acquiring some of its competitors, including eSolutions in 2020, which boosted its presence in the lucrative government health insurance market for the elderly, known as Medicare.
The company now works with 1 million healthcare providers and handles more than 2.5 billion transactions annually, according to its website.
Waystar will list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ""WAY"", with its shares expected to start trading on Friday.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group and Barclays are the lead underwriters for the IPO."

The confidential filing could take place as soon as the coming week, the report added, citing sources.
Chinese-founded Shein did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Shein, valued at $66 billion in a fundraising last year, started engaging with the London-based teams of its financial and legal advisors to explore a listing on the London Stock Exchange early this year, sources told Reuters in May.
The fast-fashion company stepped up preparations for its London listing after its attempt to float itself in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from U.S. lawmakers.
However, senior British lawmakers are also questioning Shein's suitability for a London listing and calling for greater scrutiny of the business. Shein, in response, has said it is strengthening governance and compliance."
Fat Brands confidentially files to IPO its Twin Peaks and Smokey Bones chains,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/fat-brands-twin-peaks-smokey-bones-confidentially-file-for-ipo.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107414663-1715697566182-gettyimages-1316042376-smokeybones-money_ia_8084024_20100205.jpeg?v=1715697619&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,1 month ago - CNBC News,2024-05-14 00:00:00.000000,"In this article
Fat Brands said Tuesday it has confidentially filed to take its Twin Peaks and Smokey Bones restaurant chains public through an initial public offering, less than a week after federal authorities charged the restaurant company and its chair Andy Wiederhorn for an alleged $47 million bogus loan scheme.
Fat Brands announced its intention to spin off Twin Peaks through an IPO last year. At that time, the company had already disclosed a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Wiederhorn.
On Thursday, Fat Brands, Wiederhorn and a few other people were criminally indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles for wire fraud, tax evasion and other counts related to the alleged scheme. In a separate civil complaint filed on Friday, the SEC accused the company and Wiederhorn of violations related to the same conduct.
Both Fat Brands and Wiederhorn, through an attorney, have denied the charges.
Since its founding in 2005, Twin Peaks has grown to nearly 115 restaurant locations in the U.S. and Mexico. Fat Brands bought the company in 2021. The sports bar chain is known for its female staff's revealing uniforms, similar to Hooters.
Smokey Bones is a newer addition to Fat Brands' portfolio, which currently includes 18 chains. Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants created the barbecue chain in 1999 but later sold the brand. Fat Brands acquired it in September 2023, with the goal of converting more than half its 61 corporate-owned restaurants into Twin Peaks locations.
""Our priority is to use the proceeds from any transaction to deleverage the balance sheet,"" Wiederhorn said about the potential IPO on the company's first-quarter conference call on May 1.
Wiederhorn owns 45% of Fat Brands' common shares through Fog Cutter Holdings, according to FactSet.
Shares of the company have fallen 9% this year, dragging its market value down to about $90 million.

Sam Altman's nuclear energy company Oklo plunges 54% in NYSE debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/10/sam-altman-takes-nuclear-startup-oklo-public-to-power-ai-ambitions.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107361037-17055870662024-01-18t102403z_838136397_rc2ak5a86bbx_rtrmadp_0_davos-meeting.jpeg?v=1705594949&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-05-10 00:00:00.000000,"In this article
Sam Altman is now chairman of a public company. But it's not OpenAI.
On Friday, advanced nuclear fission company Oklo started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which has yet to generate any revenue, went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called AltC Acquisition Corp., founded and led by Altman.
Under the ticker symbol ""OKLO,"" shares plummeted 54% on Friday to $8.45, valuing the company at about $364 million. Oklo received roughly $306 million in gross proceeds in the transaction, according to a release.
Oklo's business model is based on commercializing nuclear fission, the reaction that fuels all nuclear power plants. Instead of conventional reactors, the company aims to use mini nuclear reactors housed in A-frame structures. Its goal is to sell the energy to end users such as the U.S. Air Force and big tech companies.
Oklo is currently working to build its first small-scale reactor in Idaho, which could eventually power the types of data centers that OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies need to run their AI models and services.
Altman is co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which has been valued at over $80 billion by private investors. He's said that he sees nuclear energy as one of the best ways to solve the problem of growing demand for AI, and the energy that powers the technology, without relying on fossil fuels. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have also invested in nuclear plants in recent years.
""I don't see a way for us to get there without nuclear,"" Altman told CNBC in 2023. ""I mean, maybe we could get there just with solar and storage. But from my vantage point, I feel like this is the most likely and the best way to get there.""
In an interview with CNBC Thursday, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte confirmed that the company has yet to generate revenue and has no nuclear plants deployed at the moment. He said the company is targeting 2027 for its first plant to come online.
Going the SPAC route is risky. So-called reverse mergers became popular in the low-interest rate days of 2020 and 2021 when tech valuations were soaring and investors were looking for growth over profit. But the SPAC market collapsed in 2022 alongside rising rates and hasn't recovered.
AI-related companies, on the other hand, are the new darlings of Wall Street.
""SPACs haven't exactly had the best performances in the past couple of years, so for us to have sort of the outcome that we've had here is obviously a function of the work we put in, but also what we're building and also the fact that the market sees the opportunity sets here,"" said DeWitte, who co-founded the company in 2013. ""I think it's very promising on multiple fronts for [the] nuclear, AI, data center push, as well as the energy transition piece.""
The company has seen its fair share of regulatory setbacks. In 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission denied Oklo's application for an Idaho reactor. The company has been working on a new application, which it isn't aiming to submit to the NRC until early next year, DeWitte said, adding that it's currently in the ""pre-application engagement"" stage with the commission.
Altman got involved with Oklo while president of the startup incubator Y Combinator. Oklo went into the program in 2014 after an earlier meeting between Altman and DeWitte. In 2015, Altman invested in the company and became chairman.
It's not Altman's only foray into nuclear energy or other infrastructure that could power large-scale AI growth.
In 2021, Altman led a $500 million funding round in clean energy firm Helion, which is working to develop and commercialize nuclear fusion. Helion said in a blog post at the time that the capital would go toward its electricity demonstration generator, Polaris, ""which we expect to demonstrate net electricity from fusion in 2024.""
Altman didn't respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, Altman has also poured money into chip endeavors and investments that could help power the AI tools OpenAI builds.
Just before his brief ouster as OpenAI CEO in November, he was reportedly seeking billions of dollars for a chip venture codenamed ""Tigris"" to eventually compete with Nvidia.
Altman in 2018 invested in AI chip startup Rain Neuromorphics, based near OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters. The next year, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on Rain's chips. In December, the U.S. compelled a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm to sell its shares in Rain.
DeWitte told CNBC that the data center represents ""a pretty exciting opportunity.""
""What we've seen is there's a lot of interest with AI, specifically,"" he said. ""AI compute needs are significant. It opens the door for a lot of different approaches in terms of how people think about designing and developing AI infrastructure.""

Viking shares rise 8% after cruise line operator's market debut,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/viking-ipo-vik-cruise-line-company-trading-on-nyse.html,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107409108-17145964132024-05-01t203558z_73565243_rc2vh7aqxfrj_rtrmadp_0_usa-stocks-viking.jpeg?v=1714596793&w=410&h=212&vtcrop=y,2 months ago - CNBC News,2024-05-01 00:00:00.000000,"In this article
Viking is not your typical cruise operator.
Aboard its smaller, upscale vessels, you won't find any kids. In fact, the cruise line doesn't hide the fact that it is going after the high-income baby boomer.
Casinos? Not on these cruise ships.
In Viking Holdings' prospectus, the company said its cruises are for the ""thinking person,"" underscoring its efforts to appeal to the baby boomer traveler who seeks adventure and new experiences.
""They have the money, they have the time and, in my belief, the moment you try to do everything for everybody, you know what happens? You do nothing well. So we are very, very clear focused,"" Torstein Hagen, CEO and chairman of Viking, told CNBC.
The luxury cruise line was targeting a $10.4 billion valuation in its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, making it the third-largest cruise operator after Royal Caribbean and Carnival. Norwegian Cruise Line is the fourth largest. Viking started trading Wednesday at $26.15 a share under the ticker ""VIK"" after pricing at $24 a share.
It closed its first trading day with a gain of more than 8%, ending at $26.10 per share.
Viking upsized its IPO after existing shareholders decided to sell an additional 9 million shares amid strong demand from mutual fund investors, according to a source familiar with the situation.
In 1997, Viking had four ships. It has quickly grown its fleet to 92 vessels, 80 of which are river-based ships that travel down the world's biggest rivers, including the Seine in France and the Nile in Egypt.
""We're different because when you talk about the big cruise lines, they're large in the Caribbean,"" Hagen said. ""We have a tiny sliver in the Caribbean. The rest is Europe.""
The timing of Viking's IPO coincides with a strong rebound in cruise bookings. On April 25, Royal Caribbean raised its guidance for 2024 amid a bright outlook for the sector.
""Cruising has really come into the forefront as a competitive choice in travel,"" Jason Liberty, CEO of Royal Caribbean, said to CNBC in a recent interview. ""The overall travel industry is $1.9 trillion. The cruise industry is $56 billion of that. I think cruising is at a much different level than it was pre-pandemic.""
While the company's prospectus showed Viking brought in $4.71 billion in sales in 2023, it did report a net loss for the year. What is getting investors excited is the company's revenue per passenger of $7,251, which is much higher than that of any other publicly traded cruise line. Viking's premium price point allows it to make more money on each customer.
Investors will also be looking for details on Viking's expansion plans. Earlier this month, Norwegian Cruise Line said it ordered eight new ships scheduled for delivery over the next 12 years.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean and MSC Cruises all have robust portfolios, which has raised concerns of overcapacity weighing on demand. But for now, the industry is focused on how well demand has rebounded from the pandemic and that, even with higher prices, cruising is still cheaper on average than hotel vacations.
UBS leisure analyst Robin Farley said land-based hotel rates are 25% higher than in 2019. During that same time frame, cruise line rates are up 10%.
""The gap between cruising and hotels is wide. That makes cruise compelling right now,"" Farley said."
