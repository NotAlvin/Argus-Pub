      "Cordiant Digital Infrastructure Limited announced the refinancing of its Eurobond facility and repayment of the ?30 million vendor loan note agreed in connection with the purchase of Speed Fibre. The Company announces the signing of a new ?200 million Eurobond facility (\"New Eurobond\"), which will refinance the existing ?200 million Eurobond (\"Original Eurobond\") signed by the Company's indirect subsidiary Cordiant Digital Holdings Two Limited in June 2022. This refinancing provides greater certainty and flexibility for the group by extending the maturity of CORD's holding company-level term debt from September 2026 to July 2029, with a bullet repayment structure.\n",
      "The Company is also to make full repayment of the circa ?30 million vendor loan note issued as part of the acquisition of Speed Fibre, which completed in October 2023. The repayment will be made from existing cash resources and will provide the Company greater flexibility as it takes forward its growth plans for Speed Fibre. As part of the refinancing, the Company has also arranged additional complementary undrawn credit facilities totalling ?175 million, split between a growth capex facility (\"Capex Facility\") of ?105 million and a multi-currency revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") of ?70 million.\n",
      "These additional facilities have the same maturity date and repayment structure as the New Eurobond and provide the Company with an incremental long-term funding commitment for growth investments under CORD's Buy, Build & Grow model, and can enable more efficient management of the group's balance sheet. The new facilities (\"New Facilities\") were significantly oversubscribed and are being provided by a consortium of blue-chip institutions comprising investment banks DNB and Nomura, and funds managed/and or advised by Schroders Capital, UBS Asset Management, Infranity (formerly Generali Global Infrastructure), IFM Investors, and PATRIZIA. The New Facilities will be issued by Cordiant Digital Holdings UK Limited, the Company's wholly owned, direct subsidiary that is the holding company for the Company's portfolio companies in Europe.\n",
      "The terms on the New Eurobond represent an improvement on the Original Eurobond, with a longer tenor and improved credit margin rachet, which will range from 3.75% to 4.75% over EURIBOR or the 5-year EURIBOR swap rate, depending on net leverage. Three quarters of the New Eurobond will be issued as a fixed rate instrument, with the remaining amount to be floating rate in nature. Both the Capex Facility and the RCF will be floating rate facilities.\n",
      "The Company is putting in place interest rate hedging lines to manage its variable rate exposure and ensure that it is well positioned to take advantage of any further future reductions in long-term interest rates. Closing of the New Facilities remains subject to the satisfaction of a small number of administrative conditions precedent and is expected to occur shortly, The Company's net gearing ratio was 38.9% as at 31 March 2024. On a pro forma basis, if all the New Facilities are fully drawn, the Company's net gearing ratio would be 44%, below the 50% limit set out in the Company's IPO prospectus.\n",
      "On the same pro forma basis, the weighted average margin across the whole portfolio would increase slightly to 3.3% from 2.9%. The Company's total available liquidity disclosed as at 31 March 2024, pro forma for this refinancing, would have increased to £291 million from £168 million.\n",

      "Webtoon Entertainment closed higher on its first day of trading on the Nasdaq after the online comics platform backed by South Korean internet giant Naver raised $315 million in an initial public offering.\n",
      "Webtoon shares rose 9.5% to $23.00 on Thursday, lifting the Los Angeles-based company's market capitalization to roughly $2.9 billion. Webtoon had sold 15 million shares in its IPO at $21 apiece, pricing at the top end of its marketed range amid bullish investor sentiment for South Korea's fast-growing digital comics industry.\n",
      "The company is also raising $50 million in a private placement of shares to controlling shareholder Naver, the largest internet platform group in South Korea.\n",
      "Webtoon, launched in 2005 as a side project of Naver, offers thousands of digital comics titles in genres including fantasy, comedy, action, romance, horror and science fiction. The company said it booked revenue of about $1.3 billion last year and has 170 million monthly active users in more than 150 countries.\n",
      "Webtoon plans to use the IPO proceeds to expand its business in North America amid rising global popularity of Korean music, drama and cultural products. Market research firm Spherical Insights & Consulting has forecast the global industry for webtoons -- short for web-based cartoons, referring today to various types of digital comics made for reading online on computers and smartphones -- to expand to more than $60 billion by 2030 from an estimated $4.7 billion in 2021.\n",
      "Naver has a stake of more than 60% in the company, while Japanese internet company LY Corp. is also a major shareholder.\n",
      "Citi analysts John Yu and Alicia Yap trimmed their target price on Naver by 5.6% in the wake of the offering, citing a valuation for Webtoon well short of their previous estimates, as well as Naver's diluted ownership in the company. They forecast downside risk to operating profit margin in the near term, citing in part Webtoon's granting of a $30 million cash bonus to the company's chief executive during the IPO.\n",
      "The Citi analysts trimmed their estimate for Naver's 2024 operating profit by 5.4% to reflect one-off labor costs for Webtoon, but they kept a buy rating, citing ad revenue recovery, cost controls and improvement in e-commerce take rate.\n",

      "The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPR) for $4.4 billion on July 1, 2024.

The total transaction value is approximately $8.3 billion, including Spirit's last reported net debt. Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement with Boeing, Spirit shareholders will receive for each of their shares of Spirit common stock a number of shares of Boeing common stock equal to an exchange ratio calculated as $37.25 divided by the volume weighted average share price (VWAP) of Boeing common stock over the 15-trading-day period ending on the second trading day prior to the closing (the \"Closing Price\"), subject to a floor of $149.00 per share of Boeing common stock and a ceiling of $206.94 per share of Boeing common stock.

Spirit also announced today that it entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE [EUR: AIR.PA] (\"Airbus\").

      "BERLIN/STUTTGART (dpa-AFX) - New half-year record for electricity generation from renewable energies: Electricity from wind, sunlight, biomass and hydropower covered around 58 percent of electricity consumption in Germany in the first half of 2024.\n",
      "This is according to projections by the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) and the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), which were made available to dpa on Monday.\n",
      "In the first half of 2023, the share of renewable energies was still 52 percent. Gross domestic electricity consumption totaled 261 billion kilowatt hours and was therefore 0.3 percent below the previous year's figure.\n",
      "More than half from renewables\n",
      "In the first half of the year, renewable energies covered more than half of monthly electricity consumption each month, emphasized the BDEW. Since April, they have had a monthly share of 59 percent.\n",

      "In June 2024, PV systems generated more than 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity within one month for the very first time. Hydropower also made an above-average contribution to electricity generation with 12 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.\n",
      "The majority comes from onshore wind turbines\n",
      "Of the 58 percent, 24 percentage points came from onshore wind power, 14 percentage points from photovoltaics, 9 percentage points from biomass, 5 percentage points from hydropower, 5 percentage points from offshore wind power and 1 percentage point from electricity generation from municipal waste.\n",

      "Anglo American plc (LSE:AAL) is expected to appoint an investment bank any day for a sale of its $5 billion (AUD 7.5 billion) portfolio of Australian coalmining assets, according to sources in the market. The sale, which comes after an announced company break-up while it has been fending off advances from BHP, will involve big dollars for what are some of the best metallurgical coal mines in the world. That may limit the field somewhat.\n",
      "One of the parties most strongly positioned for the portfolio is BHP itself, but perhaps it does not want to be seen to be reinforcing Anglo American's break-up strategy that enhances Anglo's value. But sources say BHP will not be in contention for the mines. If the break-up of Anglo American does not go well, it's always been considered a possibility that BHP comes back a second time with an \"all of company\" bid for Anglo American after several months.\n",
      "The bet by some is that the coal auction attracts non-conforming offers. China-backed Yancoal Australia Ltd. (ASX:YAL) will probably bid for Anglo American's Capcoal and Dawson assets, while Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC), Coronado Global Resources Inc. (ASX:CRN) and Stanmore Resources Limited could bid for the other more attractive mines, Moranbah North and Grosvenor. Other assets that form part of the Queensland portfolio are the Aquila project, an interest in Jellinbah and the potential Moranbah South project, producing about 16 million tonnes a year.\n",
      "Glencore would also be large enough to buy the mines, but the Swiss trader is yet to complete its acquisition of Teck Resources, so could be distracted with that. Other than that, it's hard to see what other groups would be well placed to buy the entire portfolio, with Whitehaven Coal busy digesting the coal mines it has only just bought from BHP. There's been a view that perhaps the reason why BHP sold its Daunia and Blackwater coal mines in the first place was to make way for the Anglo American assets it would inherit as part of its planned buyout, clearing any challenges it may face owning both from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission.\n",
      "In terms of selecting an investment bank, Anglo American has used Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as its defence advisers so both could be well-placed.\n",

      "The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has offered to acquire Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.

The latest proposal represents a switch from Boeing?s plan to fund an all-cash offer after months of talks between the companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential matter. A $35 per share price would represent a premium of about 6% to Spirit?s stock as of Monday?s close, suggesting an equity valuation of $4.1 billion.\n",

      "?We await more details, but we see the $35/share mark as a reasonable outcome for both parties,? Stifel analyst Bert W. Subin said in a note to clients. Boeing?s decision to revise the payment terms is the latest twist in an unusually complex transaction, which will also require Spirit to spin off some of its manufacturing plants to Airbus SE (ENXTPA:AIR).\n",

      "The owner of the local Westfield empire, Scentre Group (ASX:SCG), has teamed up with investment bank Barrenjoey to buy a half stake in Adelaide's Westfield Tea Tree Plaza and a small adjoining centre for about $308 million. The deal marks a shift by the large mall owner, which has traditionally worked with big institutions to buy malls. By joining with the bank it is now tapping private capital that wants to directly own shopping centres, opening up a new pool of investors.\n",
      "The transaction also shows that large institutions that own malls are seeing value in them, following a fall in values triggered by higher interest rates and Covid-19. Scentre and Barrenjoey made their move on the stake in the mall in April by launching an unlisted trust to own a half interest in the property, Adelaide's second largest mall. Their surprise move effectively thwarted a transaction that would have resulted in acquisitive funds house IP Generation purchasing the stake in the mall from the Dexus-managed fund selling it.\n",
      "The move not only signals Scentre's entry into funds but this is expected to continue as more centres come up given the offer was oversubscribed. The deal also shows the large pricing recalibration of regional shopping centre assets since the boom times before the pandemic. Scentre Group Chief Executive Elliott Rusanow said the group had successfully partnered with Barrenjoey Private Capital to establish a fund to purchase a 50% share in Westfield Tea Tree Plaza and the adjoining Tea Tree Plus.\n",

The unlisted vehicle has been selling down assets to meet redemptions.\n",
      "CBRE agent Simon Rooney negotiated the deal for the Dexus-managed fund as institutional and private capital flows back into the regional shopping centre market.

The Board notes the recent press speculation and confirms that the Proposal is at 505 pence in cash for each Alpha FMC share.
