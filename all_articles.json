        "content": "HOTELS Magazine\u2019s 2024 Hoteliers of the World are recognized as two of the\npreeminent leaders in the luxury hotel space, both parts of companies that are\ntime-tested luxury groups, welcoming demanding, affluent guests and developing\nsome of the finest hotels in the world.\n\nBoth are known for their attention to detail and composure in even the most\ndemanding of situations\u2014no matter what comes their way. These are just two of\nthe many reasons why they were selected for this year\u2019s awards and, as proof,\nare admired by their peers; many of which supported their candidacy for this\nyear\u2019s awards.\n\nToday, we reveal our other awardee: Radha Arora, president of Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts. We put his life and career story in the frame below. We hope you enjoy\nit.\n\nBoth he and fellow winner, Sandeep Bhalla of The Connaught, are featured in\nprint in our forthcoming March/April issue of HOTELS Magazine.\u00a0\n\nWe, and the collective hospitality industry, congratulate the winners.\u00a0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadha Arora can rationalize any trip to Paris. On a January afternoon, the\npresident of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\nis at H\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, a designated Palace-grade hotel in the\n8th arrondissement that\u2019s hosted real-life royalty and the fictional kind: the\nprotagonist of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d composes letters from the\nhotel lobby.\n\nOn this particular day, Arora, a Los Angeles resident, is in Paris for work,\nthough the City of Light isn\u2019t why. Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, the luxury hotel\nmanagement arm of Hong Kong-based Rosewood Hotel Group, is opening the\nRosewood Schloss Fuschl, close to Salzburg, Austria, later this year and though\nRosewood also has a hotel in Vienna, Arora is working out of Paris, ensconced in\nthe landmark Crillon. Paris for any occasion.\n\nThe city and the hotel mean more to Arora than just plain work stopovers; they\nboth played pivotal roles in Arora\u2019s upbringing as the son of a foreign service\nworker. \u201cIt\u2019s a great love affair I have with the city,\u201d he said, and for good\nreason. Arora may have a 40-plus-year career in the hotel industry, but one\ncould argue he\u2019s been in it his whole life. Travel is requisite for someone\nworking in the foreign service and when his father received his first posting\nabroad in Moscow, the entire family accompanied him from Arora\u2019s birthplace of\nNew Delhi.\n\nPrior to Russia came a stop in London, where the family stayed at the Strand\nPalace, just across the way from one of the world\u2019s iconic hotels, The Savoy,\nwhich, among other London hospitality institutions, Arora refers to as a paragon\nof hotel virtue.\n\nRadha Arora is president of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. He joined the company 13\nyears ago after learning the luxury ropes with Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts.\n\nAfter Russia came Paris, where, by pure coincidence, the family lived in the\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon, which opened as a hotel in 1909, but stood as a building since\n1758\u2014in 1793, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were guillotined in the\nPlace de la Concorde directly in front of it. It\u2019s a rich, even macabre history.\n\nIt was the 60s when his love affair with the hotel industry coalesced. How could\nit not when you are a real-life Eloise? \u201cLiving in hotels, being surrounded by\nand building relationships with the housekeepers, the room-service staff, the\nbellman, the concierge, front desk\u2014that desire to be around people that are so\ncaring and nurturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were my formative years.\u201d\n\nIt was precisely those years that led him to a career in hospitality because\ntradition did not. It\u2019s typical Indian culture to strive to become a lawyer, a\ndoctor, a financier, but \u201cI wanted to be a hotelier,\u201d Arora said, adding that,\nat one point, dentistry was in the cards. Unlike a film or novel, there was no\npaternal pushback. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018You\u2019ve lived in hotels, you love hotels, you\nlove the smell of a hotel, it is all you talk about.\u2019 That was it. I went with\nhospitality.\u201d\n\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel in Paris, is a Palace-grade hotel and a\nproperty that Arora once lived in as a boy.\n\n\nON THE WAY UP\n\nArora studied hospitality in school, but his career journey didn\u2019t start until\nthe 1980s, with his first hotel job in London, as a night receptionist at the\nInn on the Park London, which later became a Four Seasons hotel after its owners\ntook the advice of a little- known Canadian hotelier named Isadore Sharp. (Arora\nrefers to him as the god of hospitality.) It was a pivotal moment for Four\nSeasons because it was its first hotel outside Canada.\n\nFour Seasons had a profound impact on Arora. The company now has more than 120\nhotels worldwide, but back then, there were only a handful, and most were in\nCanada. \u201cLondon was a hallmark of their success,\u201d Arora said, as transatlantic\ntravel boomed, spurred by the likes of the Concorde, which allowed the affluent\nto be on Broadway one night and the West End the next. For two years he was at\nthe hotel, doing the income audit, checking in guests and \u201cI loved it,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is no shortage of luxury hotels in London and there is no more effective\nway to learn the ropes than by immersing oneself in the culture. That\u2019s what\nArora did. He worked at small luxury hotels, like DUKES London in St. James\u2019s;\nhe worked at large luxury hotels, such as the InterContinental London Park Lane;\nand along the way, he picked up experience in all the varied disciplines\u2014from\nfront-of-the-house guest-facing interactions to back-of-the-house accounting,\nArora was front and center on his career arc, soaking it all in. \u201cI just wanted\nto work in great hotels,\u201d Arora said.\n\nThe lobby of The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel in New York\u2019s Upper East SIde.\n\nHe eventually became hotel manager of the famed Ritz London, where he remained\nfor seven years, a stint that included many chance meetings with the likes of\nPrincess Diana, who had a friend living in the hotel. Arora called the Princess\none of the most disarming people he\u2019d ever encountered. \u201cEverybody felt\nconnected to her,\u201d he said. And while Princess Diana was swarmed wherever she\nwent in public, Arora says that the biggest luxury anyone can have of her ilk,\nwithin a luxury hotel, is anonymity.\n\nArora\u2019s connection to London ended when the siren call of Four Seasons beckoned\nhim back. He returned to the company in 1994 and was with them for the next 17\nyears. He felt \u201cat home\u201d with Four Seasons and wanted out of London.\n\nArora took posts from Toronto to Hawaii and even for a time back in his home\ncountry, working in Goa, India. His last position with Four Seasons was one of\nthe most coveted jobs in hospitality: regional vice president and GM of the\nBeverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel, where he stayed for seven years. He\ncalls Los Angeles home today.\n\nIt was that post with Four Seasons that directly led to what is now a\n13-year-and-still-counting career with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. The Beverly\nWilshire might have been managed by Four Seasons, but it was owned by the Cheng\nfamily of Hong Kong, which, in 2011, acquired a portfolio of Rosewood-managed\nproperties from Maritz, Wolff & Co., five total, including The Carlyle, a\nRosewood Hotel, in New York, and Rosewood Little Dix Bay Resort in the British\nVirgin Islands. At the time of the transaction, the Cheng family stated that\n\u201cRosewood will be positioned for substantially accelerated global growth.\u201d\n\nRosewood Munich is housed in two restored historic buildings\u2014the former State\nBank of Bavaria headquarters and the adjacent Palais Neuhaus-Preysing\naristocratic residence.\n\n\nCOMING UP ROSES\n\nSome 13 years later, Rosewood, under the stewardship of the Cheng family and its\nscion/ CEO, Sonia Cheng, have grown the portfolio to 33 hotels operating and a\nslew more on the way, including a prospective seven more hotels in Greater China\nand seven more in Europe, which includes the The Chancery Rosewood in London,\nslated to open in 2025, and housed in the former U.S. Embassy on Grosvenor\nSquare. Arora calls it an emblem of the Rosewood brand.\n\nRosewood is also opening hotels in destinations beyond what would be considered\nthe norm. This year, it will open Rosewood Miyakojima in Japan, \u201ca destination\nthat our clients would not normally have ever dreamed of,\u201d Arora said.\n\nHe\u2019s been along for the entire ride. The Cheng family recognized greatness in\nArora by his successes in the U.S.\u2014 including the Beverly Wilshire, he had eight\nother hotels under his purview. The idea around Rosewood\u2014and qualified in the\ncompany statement when it acquired the company\u2014was to scale it up, but in a\nmanner that still allowed it to retain its almost provincial charm.\n\nBack in 2011, Sonia Cheng, Arora remembered, referred to Rosewood as a gentle\ngiant that needed to be awakened, a diamond in the rough that just needed some\nbuffing. Arora refers to the 43-year-old Cheng as his \u201cfountain of youth\u201d and\nhis best friend.\n\nWith a startup company mentality, the idea was to expand the brand globally, but\nin a manner where the culture was not bastardized. \u201cEach one of our properties\nis unique, distinct to its culture. That\u2019s what Rosewood is,\u201d Arora said.\nConsider The Carlyle, one of New York\u2019s famed hotels that shares the\nneighborhood with other celebrated hotels. Talk about unique: the hotel\u2019s\nBemelmans Bar features wall murals by Ludwig Bemelmans, the creator of the\nclassic Madeline children\u2019s books, while Woody Allen used to play clarinet with\nhis jazz band on Monday nights in Caf\u00e9 Carlyle. It\u2019s even appeared in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex\n& The City.\u201d Of the hotel, Arora said, \u201cWhen you create a property where you go\nto a city to the hotel versus for the city itself, you know you have a winner.\nIt\u2019s one of those properties where when you walk in you get goosebumps.\u201d\n\nA marbled bathroom at Rosewood Hong Kong, which soars over Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe hotel recently finished off a decade-in-the- making renovation that was\npainstakingly deliberate and meticulous to preserve the hotel\u2019s patina and\ncontinue its legacy. Arora said the older Rosewood properties, from The Caryle\nto Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, act as signposts for the newer\nRosewood properties to come.\n\nRosewood now has a handful of owned properties that Arora calls the linchpins,\nwhich, he says, act almost as showrooms. Now, the idea is to expand through an\nasset-light model, partnering with people who want a piece of Rosewood in their\nportfolio, maybe even more so for the prestige, rather than the returns. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot your typical institutional partner,\u201d Arora said.\n\nPart of Arora\u2019s remit is to strike and nurture these deals, to grow the Rosewood\nbrand by working in tandem with partners to achieve the best results, which is\nwhy Arora keeps a frenzied travel schedule. Arora favors a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\nconversation over a Zoom call. In October 2023, Town & Country published an\narticle titled: \u201cRadha Arora Shares His Favorites for Being at Home or Away.\u201d\nExpectedly, Bose QuietComfort Headphones were cited; surprisingly, were\nBlackwing pencils, which he wears down to the nub: \u201cWe\u2019re in the aesthetics\nbusiness; I work with great designers and architects, and I\u2019ve seen them use\nthese pencils, so when I have one, I feel like I, too, can contribute in some\nway,\u201d he told Town & Country.\n\nArora has contributed in many ways, but it\u2019s not just the contributions he\u2019s\nmade to propel the business, it\u2019s the contributions he\u2019s made to those around\nhim. \u201cIt\u2019s being respectful of others,\u201d Arora said. \u201cHumanity is what our\nindustry is all about. If you endorse the culture through the way you speak to\nsomebody else, then everything else pales.\u201d\n\nPassionate is how Arora believes others see him. Passionate about the way he\ngoes about his business and in his daily relationships. \u201cThis is just who I am,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt\u2019s about loyalty to our partners and to our teams. When you have\nthis culture, where you create this sense of pride, at every level, that is\nimpenetrable, and it propagates creativity.\u201d\n\nRosewood Mayakoba in Mexico\u2019s Riviera Maya.\n\nIt\u2019s taken time to grow the Rosewood brand to be a powerhouse, standing shoulder\nto shoulder with the likes of Ritz-Carlton and Arora\u2019s old outfit, Four Seasons.\nIt wasn\u2019t David slinging Goliath, but it wasn\u2019t easy; it took time and it took\nconvincing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different luxury players,\u201d Arora said. Consider H\u00f4tel de\nCrillon. It\u2019s owned by a Saudi Arabian prince, but it took some time coaxing him\nthat Rosewood was the right partner to operate the hotel. \u201cHe\u2019d ask us, \u2018Why\nRosewood? You have no properties in Europe. No infrastructure.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer seems easy but it\u2019s hard to execute on. What it really is, is a\npromise, an assurance of uniqueness and mystique, Arora said. His pitch: \u201cWe are\na well-known brand in the U.S. that will continue to evolve in Europe. You need\nto trust us with this passion and desire. We\u2019ll work on it personally.\u201d\n\nIt happened. \u201cTwelve years later, partners come to us,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe\u2019re very\nfortunate to be in the position to have created this appealing brand.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s had a big hand in it, and Arora says that his job today is to preserve the\nbrand and its culture.\n\nThirteen years in with Rosewood, Arora doesn\u2019t have any plans to go anywhere\nsoon. Besides, he said, his boss wouldn\u2019t allow it. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not going\nanywhere,\u2019\u201d Cheng has told him.\n\nHe\u2019s also in no hurry to be anywhere else. \u201cWhy would I want to? Every day is a\nunique day.\u201d",

Collaborating exclusively with local and national\nartists, the hotel leaned into the already present works from Canadian modern\nmasters and sought after artists like Guido Molinari, Marcel Barbeau, and Jack\nShadbolt, for inspiration. Directly influenced by those artists, the new pieces\nconverse together to create a cohesive collection that places Canadian art\nwithin a broader global dialogue.\n\nMain image credit: Rosewood Hotels & Resorts",

So, while a good hotel can make you feel as comfortable as\nyou would at home, a great hotel can offer you something even better \u2014 a feeling\nof belonging in a brand-new, upgraded, and wholly unique space. The new Rosewood\nMunich does exactly that.\n\n\u201cMunich hasn\u2019t seen this before \u2014 a hotel with a vibe,\u201d Radha Arora, president\nof Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, told me over cocktails at the hotel\u2019s opening f\u00eate\nin October. The hotel, he added, \u201cspeaks to the community, with all the artists\nwe showcase, it speaks to place. We have great confidence in this location.\u201d\n\nThe Rosewood Munich, as it stands now, is the culmination of a project 10 years\nin the making. And it\u2019s just as spectacular as you\u2019d expect a decade\u2019s worth of\nwork to be.\n\n\nALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS BRAND-NEW ROSEWOOD HOTEL IN MUNICH\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nEvery space, including the lobby, 132 guest rooms, restaurant Brasserie\nCuvilli\u00e9s, and Asaya Spa, is decked out in muted earth tones, light woods, and\npops of royal blues and decadent, emerald green velvet furnishings you simply\ncannot stop running your hands over.\n\nThis includes the hotel\u2019s signature Maximillian Suite, named after a royal\nBavarian family, that sports more than 2,500 square feet of living space,\nincluding a full kitchen and soaking tubs in each bathroom, which starts at\naround USD 25,000 (HKD 195,687) a night. All these glamorous decor touches are\nthanks to Tara Bernerd & Partners, who worked alongside the Munich-based\narchitectural firm Hilmer Sattler to ensure the space honoured its location\nwhile creating the most welcoming (and decadent) space possible.\n\n\u201cRosewood Munich is our first project in Germany with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\nand is a key moment for us,\u201d Bernerd shared in a statement. \u201cWe have sought to\nbring a refined residential style with a contemporary take on Baroque\narchitecture. This elevated sense of sophistication will provide a place for\nlocals and distinguished travellers to come together in this vibrant and\neclectic city.\u201d\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nWhile the Rosewood Munich still has that brand-new hotel smell, it somehow feels\nlived in. It\u2019s massive, yet cosy. Walking through the common spaces, you\u2019re\nbound to find friends, old and new, gathering for tasty chocolates set out on\nthe table, guests reading books while lounging on the plush chairs next to the\npicture windows, and perhaps even a four-legged companion or two laying out as\nif they owned the place.\n\nHowever, there is one spot you may or may not get to see while you\u2019re at the\nhotel \u2014 its ultra-exclusive and downright secretive speakeasy, known as 100B. I\ndon\u2019t want to give away too many details here, as half the fun is finding it for\nyourself. However, I did get a sneak peek at 100B, which is well\nhidden-somewhere near the bar. It\u2019s as sexy a place as they come, with rich, red\nleather furnishings, dim lighting, and some fantastically rare spirits behind\nthe bar, including a few bottles of Pappy Van Winkle that will send any whiskey\nlover into full-on fanfare. Want to get in? Try to make friends with a hotel\nbartender. He or she might reveal the secret code and the location. Just don\u2019t\nbe surprised if they look at you in total bewilderment when you ask about 100B,\nas it truly is meant to stay exclusive.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know about the hotel and my full review of the new\nRosewood Munich.\n\n[myaffiliate type=\u201dnormal\u201d button_name=\u201dShop the best travel experiences here \u201d\nurl=\u201dhttps://experiences.travelandleisureasia.com/\u201d align=\u201dcenter\u201d\nclass=\u201daffiliate-one\u201d\n\n\nTHE ROOMS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThe hotel has 73 spacious guest rooms and 59 suites, including five exclusive\nhouses, which are massive, apartment-style accommodations ideal for big groups\nor extended-stay guests. Entry-level rooms range from EUR 700 (HKD 5,941) \u2013 EUR\n2,750 (HKD 23,342); while suites range from EUR 1,200 (HKD 10,185) \u2013 EUR 4,650\n(HKD 39,469); and houses range from EUR 4,300 (HKD 36,498) \u2013 EUR 35,000 (HKD\n297,081). Every room has a fantastic view of either the Munich city skyline or\nits interior courtyard. Expect bespoke furnishings, minibars filled with local\ntreats, and marble bathrooms with not-to-miss rosemary-infused shampoos that\nwill leave your hair smelling better than ever.\n\n\nTHE SPA\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThe hotel\u2019s Asaya Spa draws much of its decor and treatment inspiration from its\nalpine surroundings. Here, guests can indulge in holistic treatments using\nproducts by Dr Barbara Sturm, OTO, Ground Wellbeing, and EviDenS de Beaut\u00e9. The\n1,300-square-foot spa includes an indoor pool, dual saunas, steam rooms, and six\ntreatment rooms. I recommend springing for The Aufguss Journey, a 120-minute\ntreatment that uses aromatherapy and happens over three phases \u2014 a body scrub, a\nwrap, and a massage. I loved that the treatment uses a native pine and spruce\nblend for that all-important \u201csense of place\u201d the Rosewood is known for.\n\n\nFOOD AND DRINKS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nRosewood Munich is bringing more fine dining to the city thanks to Cuvilli\u00e9s.\nThe brasserie is open to both guests and locals who wish to come enjoy meals\nbuilt around ingredients sourced from the region, including Helmut Schlader\nAlpine caviar, Wagyu beef from Tegernsee, and lamb from a breeder in Jochberg,\nlocated just two hours away. The menu highlights include bites of steckerlfisch\n(grilled fish) alongside spinach dumplings, and, of course, wiener schnitzel.\nBut please don\u2019t overlook the Celeriac Cream Soup as an appetiser. Made with\ntruffle, spices, and white balsamic, it\u2019s the perfect start to a hearty meal.\n\nFollowing your last bite, make your way to Bar Montez, where you can not only\nget a craft cocktail, wine, or local beer, but you can also take in live music\nby jazz musicians strumming in the corner.\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\nACTIVITIES AND EXPERIENCES\n\nThere is a dedicated concierge team at the hotel to assist guests in planning a\nbespoke itinerary. The team can help book exclusive guided tours through local\nmuseums like the Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art (MUCA), as well as visits\nto historic destinations like the Nymphenburg Palace or more adrenaline-filled\nactivities like BMW Driving Tours.\n\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY OFFERINGS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nKids are also more than welcome at the hotel. The concierge team is happy to\ncreate experiences just for them, including local cooking classes and arts and\ncrafts sessions. The hotel is also happy to assist in babysitting services so\nparents can head out for a night on the town sans kids.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\nThe Rosewood Munich is ADA compliant, offering three ADA-compliant rooms, and\nhas a ground-floor elevator to allow easy access in and out of the building. As\nfor sustainability, during the hotel\u2019s construction, the team recycled 96\npercent of the materials from the demolition to use in the new space, including\n1,500 tons of metal, cables, copper pipes, reinforced concrete, and glass. This\nhotel, like other Rosewood properties, is in line with Rosewood\u2019s principle of\n\u201cRelationship Hospitality,\u201d meaning it has a close relationship with local\nsuppliers to reduce environmental demands on the supply chain. And, perhaps most\nimpressive of all, the brasserie kitchen has bins to convert waste to energy,\nwhich powers part of the restaurant.\n\n\nHOW TO GET THE MOST VALUE\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThere are a few ways to maximise your value at Rosewood. Book one of the\nRosewood Escapes, which includes complimentary breakfast for two, complimentary\naccess to Asaya Spa, and complimentary access to the fitness suite.

        "content": "When you hear travel critics say that the big brands like Marriott and Hilton\ndon't really know how to run luxury hotels, it's probably because those critics\nhave stayed at a property affiliated with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts.\n\nThe Texas-originating (the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas was the\ncompany's first hotel) and now Hong Kong-based luxury hotel brand was born of\nthe idea of creating properties with residential touches and hyperattentive\nservice.\n\nRosewood is also known for designing hotels that become landmarks in the cities\nin which they operate: The Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel in New York City is\nsynonymous with legendary jazz and equally as legendary mixology. Rosewood Hong\nKong's perch on Victoria Harbour is home to some of the city's most renowned\npower dining spots as well as an incubator of sorts of the brand's newer\nmembership club, Carlyle & Co., as well as a beefed-up city version of\nRosewood's Asaya spa concept.\n\nExpect more of this kind of luxurious localization to spread around the world,\nas the company's expansion streak is expected to build over the next few years\nto the highest growth seen in the company's 44-year history.\n\n\"As we continue to add new properties and as we continue to find new locations,\nthat's the first thing we look at,\" Radha Arora, Rosewood's president and\nco-chief development officer, said. \"Is this property really emblematic of that\nlocation?\"\n\nRelated: What it's like staying at the Rosewood Baha Mar\n\nRosewood currently has 32 hotels across its portfolio but is on track to more\nthan double that number in coming years. Rosewood Munich opened this month in\nGermany but will gain several new siblings next year with the expected arrivals\nof Rosewood Amsterdam, Rosewood Schloss Fuschl in Austria, Rosewood Miyakojima\nin Japan and Rosewood Doha.\n\nProperties in Milan, Mexico City, Rome, Vietnam, Venice and Greece as well as a\nsecond London hotel, are slated beyond those 2024 openings.\n\n\"[2025] is going to be one of those years where we're going to be probably\nopening the most properties we've ever opened in one particular year,\" Arora\nsaid.\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals\nfrom TPG\u2019s experts\n\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to\nour Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You\nmay unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\nTHINKING LIKE A LOCAL\n\nDon't take the accelerating growth as a sign the company is moving into a more\ncookie-cutter design phase where hotels can be replicated and built quickly.\nArora noted the company still goes to great lengths to have a deliberative\ndevelopment process so that hotels resemble the surrounding community and are a\nplace where locals want to socialize.\n\nThe Mansion at Turtle Creek, a manor house-style hotel nestled within a\nresidential Dallas neighborhood, established the localized flourishes that\nRosewood is still known for decades later. The brand specifically chose Rosewood\nLondon's location near Covent Garden because it wasn't in the usual bastion of\nultraluxury hotels in the city like Mayfair or Knightsbridge, Arora said.\n\nParis' Hotel de Crillon, a Rosewood Hotel is supposed to feel like a living room\nof \"old apartments that, over the years, you've collected pieces and accessories\nwhile you've been living in Paris, home to the fashionistas,\" he added.\n\nThe hyperlocalization and attention to detail appear to be working and are even\na business advantage in wooing both guests and deals for more hotels. Hotel de\nCrillon saw its highest-ever occupancy and demand levels this year, Arora said.\nFurther, room nights booked at Rosewood Bangkok are up 153% from a year ago\nwhile Rosewood Phuket is up 29%.\n\n\"We don't build properties for tourists. We build properties for locals, first\nand foremost, and make sure that we engage ourselves with the local partners,\"\nArora said. \"That comes to food, amenities and anything that comes to\npunctuating a property.\"\n\nBuild for the locals, and the out-of-towners will follow their lead, the\nthinking goes.\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR ROSEWOOD\n\nRosewood's growth trajectory has also seen the company expand into newer\nventures under the direction of Sonia Cheng, the company's CEO.\n\nThe growth of residential components at Rosewood properties, as well as\nstand-alone Rosewood-branded residential developments, is on the rise. As of\nthis year, half of the company's existing hotel portfolio, as well as its\ndevelopment pipeline, features a residential component. There are also six\nstand-alone residential projects in various stages of development in markets\nlike Beverly Hills, California, and South Florida.\n\n\"We were hesitant at first, but we realized that people want a piece of Rosewood\nas their home,\" Arora said with a laugh.\n\nCarlyle & Co., a membership club paying homage to the Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel\nin New York City, is located within the same tower as Rosewood Hong Kong. The\nself-described \"modern, progressive\" club is meant to be more of an inclusive\nspace than other private Hong Kong clubs, and Rosewood leadership maintains it's\na place where character and personality trump what one does for a living. There\nare plans to expand Carlyle & Co. to select global destinations.\n\nAsaya, Rosewood's wellness offering, is in six hotels \u2014 including Guangzhou,\nHong Kong, Vienna and Phuket \u2014 with plans for continued expansion. Asaya is more\nof an immersive experience than a usual hotel spa, with well-being classes,\ntreatments, nutritionists and even overnight Asaya Lodges for \"contemplative,\nregenerative stays\" offered to coincide with a treatment program that fits the\nguest.\n\nNew World Hotels & Resorts, Rosewood Hotel Group's upper-upscale brand, is a nod\nto the Hong Kong company that acquired Rosewood when it was still a privately\nheld Texas company. The Asia-focused brand currently has 15 hotels in its\nportfolio, with three more slated to open by the end of 2023 and an additional\ntwo opening next year.\n\n\"Growing new brands and business ventures will further position us as a brand of\nchoice for modern luxury consumers in the future,\" Arora said.\n\n\nBUSINESS AND INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\n\nWith global macroeconomic conditions a little murky at the moment, it's\nreasonable to wonder if there's a limit to the runway for all the growth in\nultraluxury hotels. Sure, customers in this social strata tend to be a little\nrecession-proof, but high interest rates make expansion more difficult amid\nrising construction costs.\n\nWhile Arora is mindful of the economy, he also sees opportunity and advantage\nwith Rosewood being a smaller brand.\n\n\"There is always going to be some kind of cycle.

The castle, originally a hunting lodge for the\nPrince-Archbishops of Salzburg, dates back to 1461. Long a part of the Holy\nRoman Empire, the area became part of Austria in 1803. The last\nPrince-Archbishop who exercised secular authority, Count Hieronymus von\nColloredo, is remembered today as a patron of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\na native of Salzburg.\n\nThe resort offers a look at the area\u2019s history and culture with personalized\ntours curated by the Rosewood concierge team. Cultural programming includes\nbehind the scenes experiences with famous Austrian umbrella craftsman, Mr.\nKirchtag, and private tours of Festspielhaus, Salzburg\u2019s historic opera hall.\n\nThe 100-year-old Salzburg Festival, which features opera, drama and concerts, is\nworld-renowned. The opening of Rosewood Schloss Fuschl is well-timed for the\n2024 festival, which begins July 19 and stretches into August.\n\nSalzburg was not only once the home of the Von Trapp family but was also a\nfilming location for The Sound of Music. Aficionados of the film can enjoy\nFraulein Maria\u2019s bicycle tour or visit a \u201cSound of Music\u201d puppet performance at\nthe Marionette Theater in Salzburg.

The area offers\nmany scenic views of the forests and mountains.

The fishing trips end with smoked fish\nwrapped in newspaper just like the locals eat it, washed down with Austrian\nwine.\n\nFor outdoor recreation, the area offers golf, tennis, biking and horseback\nriding in addition to hiking. In the winter, there is ice skating, tobogganing\nand skiing.\n\nThe resort says that by sourcing most ingredients and materials from within a\n100-kilometer radius, it not only ensures freshness but also reduces carbon\nemissions associated with transportation. The Schloss Fuschl honeybee colony\nproduces local honey and plays a crucial role in pollinating the surrounding\nflowers. And by harnessing the thermal properties of the lake, Rosewood Schloss\nFuschl reduces its reliance on traditional heating and cooling methods.\n\nThe Gr\u00fcner Salon at the new Rosewood Schloss Fuschl hotel.

Contemporary pieces accent its\nlobby and numerous hallways, including works by Damien Hirst and Henry Moore.\nOctagonal designs are also woven into the core of its design philosophy, drawn\nfrom the auspicious significance of the number eight in Chinese tradition.\n\nWhere am I sleeping? All 413 rooms in the hotel are a tale of two halves. The\nbedroom areas are all about neutral tones, plush seating and polished wood,\noffering a restrained aesthetic designed to encourage a state of total zen,\nrounded off by the floor-to-ceiling windows offering unparalleled vistas of Hong\nKong Island. Enter the bathrooms, however, to be greeted by symphony of marble\nand mirrors, eliciting the palatial feel of a bygone era. Perhaps a mismatch on\npaper, both work in total symbiosis to deliver a timeless and multi-faceted\ntaste of luxury across each guest\u2019s stay.\n\nInternational dining: There are 11 restaurants housed within the hotel.

Prior to the hotel\u2019s construction, the area\nwas home to the New World Centre, a commercial and residential megacomplex built\nby Cheng\u2019s grandfather in the 1970s.

        "content": "The formula for luxury hotels has typically had two key ingredients. First,\nchoose locations in the districts where the elite live. Second, focus on\nhigh-touch services encouraging guests to linger, and spend, at the property.\n\nBut Rosewood Hotels & Resorts has taken somewhat alternative approaches when it\ncreated the 30 luxury hotels it operates today \u2014 and as it builds the 25 luxury\nhotels it has in the pipeline. Its strategy responds to shifts in consumer\ntastes.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s client is looking for an immersive, stand-out experience,\u201d said Radha\nArora, president and co-chief development officer. \u201cGone are the days when you\ngo and build right smack in the middle of the obvious epicenter of fashion,\nshopping, or nightlife.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Rosewood Hotel Group does broadly target major tourist destinations.\nNext year, the brand plans to open Rosewood Munich, the brand\u2019s first property\nin Germany, and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl, the group\u2019s second property in Austria.\nIn 2024, Rosewood Rome aims to debut. In 2025, Rosewood Milan and Rosewood Hotel\nBauer near Venice are slated to open. The company also intends to expand in\nAsia, with nine announced openings, and in Latin America, where it debuted\nRosewood S\u00e3o Paulo this year. It\u2019s also growing a branded residential offering\nworldwide.\n\n\nGEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE AND THE NEW LUXURY\n\nBut the difference is in the nuance. The conventional wisdom in building luxury\nhotels has been to go to the traditionally most desirable neighborhoods in\npopular destinations because being seen by the right people is often what guests\nwant most. Yet Rosewood often takes a contrarian approach.\n\nWhen it opened in London, for example, it took on a property in \u201cthe City,\u201d or\nfinancial district, rather than a district like Mayfair or Knightsbridge. The\nbrand bet that its core customer, the next-generation elite, would put an\nespecially high value on memorable experiences, which it believed the character\nof the building lent itself to creating.\n\nA flamboyantly decorated, Edwardian-era insurance office was reconfigured as\nRosewood London. Its central carriageway entrance is where the gates open up and\ntraditionally glad staff welcome guests to enter through doors that look like\nthe front door to number 10 Downing Street.\n\n\u201cCreating the sense you\u2019re arriving into a manor or estate in an intimate way\nlike we did there isn\u2019t possible to do elsewhere in central London,\u201d Arora said.\n\n\nOFF-CENTER TARGETS\n\nAs money earmarked to chase high-end real estate assets expands, targets can\nbecome elusive. Part of the Rosewood formula has been finding properties away\nfrom tourist epicenters that can be converted in a lightweight way and can drive\nhigh average daily rates under the Rosewood brand.\n\nA case in point: Creating Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco involved transforming a\nproperty that wasn\u2019t located in one of Tuscany\u2019s most sought-after areas.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t capital intensive because the project was already built,\u201d Arora said.\n\u201cThe Cheng family did take 50 percent ownership at first but then sold that at a\ngood price, and the project didn\u2019t need any capital injection. All it needed was\nthe power of the brand. When we took over Castiglion del Bosco, within the first\ndays we were almost $2 million, I mean, \u20ac2 million, up on what the property had\nbeen generating before.\u201d\n\nIn Saint Barts, the group worked with real estate mogul David Bonderman who was\nthen the owner of Le Guanahani, located on the less visited northern side of the\nisland. Four years of renovations on the three-decade-old family resort\ntransformed it into Rosewood Le Guanahani.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the revenues in the festive season to be 70 percent higher than\nbefore the property was branded Rosewood,\u201d Arora said.\n\nBy choosing locations that haven\u2019t yet been dominated by the scenesters,\nRosewood has a shot at creating the new local scene while also working with\ncapital partners to buy buildings at relatively cheaper prices than properties\nin more central locations.\n\n\u201cIf you take Rosewood Mayakoba, for instance, there was nothing there in that\npart of the Riviera in the luxury end,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe built and it became the\ndestination.\u201d\n\n\nLUXURY LAND GRAB\n\nCreating anything in famously expensive cities such as Hong Kong, London, or New\nYork will involve expense. But Rosewood tries to find undervalued assets to give\nit a margin cushion after revitalization. Its developers divide and conquer\npotential luxury travel fiefdoms.\n\nTo encourage repeat visits by past customers, which is cheaper than acquiring\nnew guests, the company believes building a network of properties that are all\ndistinctive creates a virtuous cycle of surprise and delight.\n\nA Rosewood customer that liked staying in a hale, or a glamorous beach bungalow\nin Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort (which aims to open on the big\nisland in summer 2023), may like the contrast with the very urban and old-school\nRosewood Vienna, which has only 99 guest rooms and suites in a residential-style\nAustrian neighborhood.\n\nThe Vienna property has furniture meant to evoke past local aesthetics, such as\nthe Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte style at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n\u201cIn choosing the pieces of furniture for Vienna, we had a thoughtful designer\nwork with local partners and the ownership to make sure we curated something\nmindful of what the returns would be insofar as revenues are concerned after\neffectively attracting a clientele that could support the desire rate,\u201d Arora\nsaid.\n\nA representation of the planned Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort. Source:\nRosewood.\n\n\nCREATING OFF-PROPERTY EXPERIENCES\n\nMost of Rosewood\u2019s customers are leisure travelers who care more about the\nexperiential aspect of trips than business travelers ordinarily do.\nHigh-net-worth travelers make up the most profitable segment of its customer\ndatabase. Many of these travelers seek \u201cthe new luxury\u201d defined more by\nexperiences than showing off status symbols and checking boxes on seeing\nparticular sights.\n\nOne of Rosewood\u2019s calling cards is having staff talk to guests and offering to\ninvent relevant, bespoke experiences for them. If guests are foodies, it might\npropose a multi-day excursion to Oaxaca, Mexico, with Rosewood staff guiding an\nexploration of the food scene \u2014 even though Rosewood doesn\u2019t have a property\nthere.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just arrange it,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe will go with you. We\u2019re not just\nselling someone else\u2019s private tours. We want to help like-minded guests really\nget to know each other, so we have a small nucleus of a client database that\u2019s\nbecome friends through Rosewood experiences.\u201d\n\nRosewood S\u00e3o Paulo opened this year. Source: Rosewood.\n\n\nEXPANDING WORLDWIDE\n\nLike many China-based companies, Rosewood is part of a conglomerate, New World,\nwith interests in multiple sectors. Rosewood Hotels Group is led by CEO Sonia\nCheng, a member of the billionaire Cheng family that runs parent conglomerate\nNew World.\n\nIn the 2021 fiscal year, the hotel operations segment of New World reported\nrevenue of approximately $100 million (807.6 million Hong Kong Dollars), which\naccounted for 1.2 percent of the conglomerate\u2019s revenue.\n\n\u201cI want to ensure that wherever we build Rosewood properties, \u2018sense of place\u2019\nis not just a tagline but infused into every aspect,\u201d Arora said.",

        "content": "Sonia Cheng walks into the Butterfly P\u00e2tisserie at the H\u00f4tel de Crillon at 10am\non the dot on a Saturday. The 42-year-old CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group \u2013 which in\n2017 assumed management of this Parisian institution, commissioned by Louis XV\nin 1758 \u2013 is wearing a\u00a0fawn-coloured Saint Laurent blazer over a white T-shirt,\na\u00a0thick gold-snake chain and an aura of total focus. It\u2019s Fashion Week, she\u2019s\nhere for only three days, and she has a lot on her plate: she arrived from\nHong\u00a0Kong, where she lives with her husband and five children, and went straight\nto a handful of shows. In two hours\u2019 time she will co-host a lunch for 22 with\nLaure H\u00e9riard Dubreuil, the founder of Miami-based fashion powerhouse The\nWebster. She has just spent her breakfast\u00a0being photographed in the hotel\u2019s Bar\nLes Ambassadeurs for this magazine. She asks for coffee and\u00a0says she\u2019s \u201creally\njetlagged\u201d \u2013 though when I\u2019d entered the sumptuous fitness centre at what I\nthought an\u00a0unconscionably early hour for a weekend morning, she\u00a0was already\nwrapping up her workout.\u00a0\n\nAs chief executive, Cheng oversees a hotel group with\u00a0more than 40 properties in\noperation across 20 countries, of which 31 are Rosewoods, with almost as many in\nthe works. She has simultaneously developed three more brands \u2013 a residences\ncollection, a wellness concept and\u00a0a\u00a0members\u2019 club \u2013 while sitting on several\nboards, including the Hong Kong Tourism Authority. She\u2019s\u00a0also vice-chairman of\nher family\u2019s multibillion-dollar Chow Tai\u00a0Fook Jewellery Group \u2013 one of the\nlargest jewellery companies in the world, by market cap \u2013 whose parent, Chow Tai\nFook Enterprises, capitalised much of Rosewood\u2019s development. (She is reportedly\neffecting a modernisation of both its designs and the brand\u2019s 7,700+ stores\nworldwide.)\n\nSo if focus trumps bonhomie for much of our meeting, fair enough. Speaking\u00a0in a\nlow voice at a fast clip, she is pleasant but never not crystally, didactically\non message about what makes her, and Rosewood, tick.\n\nThe entrance of H\u00f4tel de Crillon, Paris \u00a9 Julien Lienard\nCheng in Les Ambassadeurs \u00a9 Julien Lienard\n\nIn the 12 years since Cheng\u2019s father, Cheng Kar-Shun (known as Henry), the\nbillionaire chairman of Hong Kong-based New World Development (which includes\nNew World Hotels, an Asia-based collection), acquired the Rosewood brand, its\nhotels have proliferated across six continents. Like most privately held\ncompanies, Rosewood doesn\u2019t report financials, but said bookings to the end of\nQ3 2023 are up\u00a047 per cent worldwide on 2019 and topline growth on revenue has\nexceeded 60 per cent in the past four years. In an industry projected to more\nthan double from its current valuation of around $140bn to almost $300bn\nby\u00a02030, they compete with the independent and multibrand conglomerate\ncategories alike.\n\nIts pipeline of 28 hotels is formidable even by industry leaders\u2019 standards\n(Four Seasons, a behemoth with $4.3bn in revenue in 2022, has around 50).\nRosewood\u2019s reimagining of Venice\u2019s storied Bauer Hotel, slated to open in 2025,\nis one of several heritage European projects, along with Amsterdam, Salzburg,\nMilan and Rome, all on the heels of Vienna opening last year, and Munich opening\nlast week. Two resorts in Saudi Arabia, part of that country\u2019s\ntrillion-dollar-plus Vision 2030 development initiatives, will open by 2026,\nalong with a Riyadh hotel. Weeks before we meet, Cheng signed a deal to take\nover the three award-winning Robertson Lodges in New Zealand. There are urban\nflagships on the way in Shanghai, Mexico City and \u2013 the most buzzed-about \u2013 a\nnew, second hotel in London, where Rosewood is currently gutting the former US\nEmbassy building on Grosvenor Square, with Sir David Chipperfield leading the\narchitecture and interiors team.\n\nLas Ventanas al Para\u00edso in Mexico\n\n\u201cThe key is to design a hotel that doesn\u2019t feel like a\u00a0hotel,\u201d Cheng says. She\nwants to make environments to\u00a0appeal as much to the next-door neighbour as to\nthe guest who\u2019s arrived from several time zones away. \u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0a very important\ningredient of this brand; it\u2019s how we\u2019ve differentiated. We want to make it\nresonate with the neighbourhood, to make people say when they walk in, \u2018This is\na place I can hang out with my friends.\u2019 We curate every single space [to that\nend].\u201d\n\nIf all that lands a bit like boilerplate lifted straight from the press\nliterature of Luxury Hotel Company X, consider the Rosewood London, whose 10th\nanniversary the company is celebrating this year \u2013 the first hotel Cheng opened\nafter being appointed CEO, aged 28. She had a degree in applied mathematics from\nHarvard, and a few years each at Morgan Stanley and Warburg Pincus under her\nbelt, but\u00a0zero formal hospitality experience. The Edwardian pile on High Holborn\nwas formerly part of the Renaissance chain. Sceptics (including your writer)\nquestioned the wisdom of locating a property intended to compete with the likes\nof Claridge\u2019s in the weird socio-demographic selva oscura between Covent Garden\nand Fleet Street. \u201cPeople told me I was crazy, that we\u2019d never be able to\nattract the foot traffic we\u2019d need. But it\u2019s such a beautiful building; I don\u2019t\nthink there\u2019s another courtyard like that in any hotel in London,\u201d she says.\u00a0\n\nCheng introduced the Holborn Dining Room \u2013 an all\u2011day British brasserie with\nfire engine-red banquettes, waiters in fitted waistcoats and forage caps, and\ntruffle fries and gourmet pies on the menu. Across the portico was Scarfes, a\ncocktail bar lined with bespoke cartoons by celebrated English illustrator\nGerald Scarfe, presided over by world-class mixologists. Within a couple\u00a0of\nmonths, both were doing brisk trades; the bar\u00a0regularly had a queue out the\ndoor. In the hotel itself,\u00a0the suites flowed like high-spec apartments: antique\ndesks, minibars in lacquered oriental cabinets, proper kitchens with tile floors\nand gallery-hung walls. Cheng, known in the industry for having her hands\ndeep\u00a0in the design side of things (\u201cI love it \u2013 I have a really\u00a0strong team, but\nwith certain flagship properties I\u00a0still get quite involved\u201d), had tapped Tony\nChi and Martin\u00a0Brudnizki (now a ubiquitous force in hotel design,\u00a0but then still\nan emerging star).\n\nRosewood Beijing followed a similar strategy in 2014: create something\nunexpected for the city \u2013 sleek but laid-back, full of greenery, with a haute\nhot-pot caf\u00e9 in place of\u00a0the conventional Michelin-endorsed destination. Within\nthree months of opening, Cheng says, its RevPAR (revenue per available room) was\nnumber one in the market, despite Rosewood having no other Asian presence and no\nloyalty programme.\n\nTen years and some 20 openings later, her disruptive successes have put paid to\nmuch of the nepo baby-centric speculation that initially surrounded her\nappointment \u2013 and made Rosewood popular with the industry\u2019s blue-chip investment\npartners. The brand\u2019s tagline, \u201cA Sense of Place\u201d, may predate her tenure as\nchief executive, but it\u2019s Cheng who imbued it with the tangible signifiers that\ndeliver returns.\n\nThe new Rosewood Munich, housed in a former bank Cheng in the Tristan\nAuer-designed Boudoir, in the lobby of the H\u00f4tel de Crillon \u00a9 Julien Lienard\n\nHenry Cheng\u2019s acquisition of the company was \u201cbrilliant move number one\u201d, says\nJames McBride, CEO of\u00a0Nihi hotels and an industry doyen of almost 40 years.\n\u201cBrilliant move number two was putting Sonia in charge.\u201d For a decade before\nCheng acquired Rosewood, McBride ran The Carlyle in New York, one of the most\nrecognised names in its original portfolio; numerous colleagues from his time as\na senior director at Ritz-Carlton have gone on to work with Cheng. McBride\npraises her \u201cgreat instincts and engaged leadership\u201d, her aptitude for site\nselection and conversion, and her skill at recruiting top talent (while hotel\nGMs who\u2019ve found her management style to be overly controlling are not unheard\nof, more often what\u2019s expressed is admiration). \u201cThe excitement, the momentum\n[that currently surrounds the brand] can be felt from afar. She has created that\nlightning-in-a-bottle thing, and I think she\u2019s only getting started.\u201d\n\nBut luxury hospitality moves fast. \u201cMy goal is to be a purpose-led luxury\nlifestyle brand,\u201d she declares. \u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Who are your hotel\ncompetitors?\u2019 \u2013 of course, we have them, but in my mind I compare us to luxury\nbrands; I want us to be learning from retail and fashion, those different\nspaces.\u201d Making them an actual part of the Rosewood brand is in the strategy as\nwell: the lunch Cheng hosts with H\u00e9riard Dubreuil in Paris\u00a0is to celebrate a\nseries of Rosewood-The Webster pop-ups in the US, a collaboration that will be\nevolved across more locations, possibly as permanent retail presences with\nprivate shopping privileges.\n\nSustainability is now in the mix \u201cfrom the moment we start planning\u201d, Cheng\nsays, noting that today\u2019s luxury consumers are more societally and\nenvironmentally conscious. \u201cWe need to build it [into the hardware], but also\nmake it part of the experience.\u201d The company recently inaugurated Rosewood\nImpacts as its official ESG initiative, but various policies and implementations\ngo back years.\u00a0\n\nBemelmans Bar in The Carlyle New York \u00a9 Jennifer Cooke\n\nWhen I admit to having struggled with the lofty, vaguely worded Impacts\nliterature her press office had provided, she immediately starts ticking off\nconcrete executions: The Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo, a new-build that opened in 2022,\nruns on 100 per cent renewable energy, has its own waste-management facilities,\nand around 75 per cent of building materials used were locally produced or\nupcycled (or both).\u00a0Kona Village Resort, on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, which Rosewood\nre-flagged earlier this year, is now powered by 8,000 solar panels \u2013 the largest\nprivate micro-grid in the state, and the only one to run entirely on solar. She\ntells me the company is ahead of schedule on its 2050 carbon-neutrality target\n(which is more than can be said of a few big western democracies\u2019 net-zero\nefforts).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFamily travel is seen through this lens as well. \u201cWhen we were first thinking\nabout kids\u2019 experiences in\u00a0the hotels [years ago], one of my team members had\nall sorts of ideas for digital experiences, all focused on that kind of\ninterface.\u201d She looks at me in disbelief and laughs. \u201cI just went, \u2018Actually,\nno! The opposite! Hands-on, high-touch\u2019\u201d \u2013 get them in nature, into local\ncommunities. \u201cThey\u2019re always in front of a screen at home, this is one of\u00a0their\nonly chances not to be. I mean, why are you even\u00a0travelling?\u201d She cites plans to\ncreate kids\u2019 \u201clearning retreats\u201d at a Maldives resort slated to open in a couple\nof years \u2013 several-days-long educational programmes (\u201cor 10 days, or even two\nweeks\u201d), focused on marine conservation \u2013 as an example of the company\u2019s\ndirection.\n\nHer other three brands \u2013 Rosewood Residences, Asaya (the company\u2019s wellness\nconcept, with currently just six locations, three in Asia) and Carlyle & Co, the\nmembers\u2019 club \u2013 are moving ahead at different paces. \u201cWe launched Asaya in Hong\nKong with the idea to have it be\u00a0a\u00a0holistic offering. That meant not just [spa]\nbut nutritionists, a lot of post-maternity treatments, visiting practitioners.\u201d\nI ask if she personally finds the wellness space interesting, and am politely\nstonewalled: \u201cI think it has a lot of potential.\u201d But does she find carving out\na meaningful wellness brand in the luxury hotel market \u2013 where terms like\nbiohacking and epigenetics now get thrown about as regularly as lomi lomi\nmassage and lift facial once were \u2013 a challenge? \u201cOur target audience obviously\ncares about wellbeing. So how does Rosewood play a role in facilitating that?\nBut I don\u2019t think we should overcomplicate it; just be authentic. I don\u2019t\nbelieve in introducing fancy words just to differentiate.\u201d\n\nDeveloping residences is almost a business imperative,\u00a0but it\u2019s also a natural\nextension: Rosewood has managed apartments at The Carlyle since 2002, and sold\nholiday residences and townhouses from Vancouver to S\u00e3o Paulo to every location\nin Mexico in which it operates. In the past two years, Cheng has announced\nsix\u00a0standalone Rosewood Residences, unaffiliated with any hotel. \u201cWe get a lot\nof customers who say, I want this for\u00a0my home \u2013 this exact design, this exact\ncuration. So\u00a0how do you take that notion and put it in a residence?\u201d\u00a0If\u00a0the\nstarting prices in Beverly Hills of $10mn\u00a0are any indication, they\u2019re\nsucceeding.\n\nSays Cheng: \u201cWe want to make people say when they walk in, \u2018This is a place I\ncan hang out with my friends\u2019\u201d \u00a9 Julien Lienard\n\nCarlyle & Co, the members\u2019 club Cheng launched two years ago, currently has just\none location at present, atop\u00a0the Rosewood Hong Kong \u2013 and she\u2019s keeping schtum\nabout where the next will open.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not about quantity here,\u201d she says. \u201cWith membership, it\u2019s always the\nright location and city. You know the Carlyle \u2013 it has such a rich soul. You\nwalk in and might not feel it\u2019s the grandest hotel ever; there are parts that\nare probably dated, the tables are maybe too close together at Bemelmans [Bar].\nBut there\u2019s a sense of community that\u2019s real. Somehow, it\u2019s kind of a club, even\nthough it\u2019s not.\u201d She \u201ctook the soul of all that\u201d back to Hong Kong, recreating\nan outpost of the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, nightly jazz and all. It still, she says, has a\nwaiting list for membership in the hundreds.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to be growing all at once, it seems to me; but clearly not to Cheng.\n\u201cAll these touch points are opportunities,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of us\nbeing in this business, I think. We can be a platform for connecting people in\ncommunities, and enriching the places we operate in. We can play that role. I\nfind it to be a very meaningful part of what we do.\u201d It has the ring of the note\nshe\u2019d like to end on: very on-message, also like something she really believes,\ndefinitely like something she intends to make happen.\u00a0",

        "link": "https://fortune.com/asia/2023/11/29/hong-kong-billionaire-henry-adrian-cheng-new-world-development-succession-heir/",
        "content": "For years, Adrian Cheng had all the trappings of a third-generation scion\npreparing to lead one of Hong Kong\u2019s wealthiest clans into a new era. He infused\nhis property projects with art, burnished Tsim Sha Tsui\u2019s waterfront as a\ncultural district and invested in digital tokens.\u00a0\n\nThis month, his heir-apparent status at the\u00a0$26 billion family\u00a0empire was thrown\ninto doubt after his father Henry Cheng said the conglomerate is\u00a0still\nlooking\u00a0for a successor.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still observing but I think it\u2019s not so easy to identify such a person,\u201d he\nsaid in a television interview, adding that the family has a wide range of\noperations and qualified \u201cmembers can be in charge of each business sector. If\nthere\u2019s no family member suitable, we can hire from the outside.\u201d\n\nThe revelation from Hong Kong\u2019s third-richest man raised eyebrows in a city\nall-too familiar with succession battles that often erupt into public view and\noccasionally wind up in court. Former casino baron Stanley Ho and property\ntycoon Lo Ying Shek are just two examples.\n\nHenry\u2019s comments could mean that he hopes to have each family member lead a\nparticular segment, but not necessarily pick one leader for the entire\nbusinesses, said Winnie Peng, director of the Roger King Center for Asian Family\nBusiness and Family Office at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\nShe added that it\u2019s often a process of evolving from a family business to a\nbusiness family.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen families are planning for succession, there could be potential sibling\nrivalry,\u201d Peng said. \u201cThis is something that they have to be really careful\nabout.\u201d But if the family members are harmonious and share the same values, then\nthis problem can be avoided, she said.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, Henry\u2019s close associates didn\u2019t share details of the\ninterview on the family-backed HOY TV with his children before it aired, people\nfamiliar with the matter said, requesting not to be named because the matter is\nprivate. Adrian was aware of the interview and its contents before it was\nbroadcast, a spokesperson said, without providing further details.\u00a0\n\nIt had been widely expected that Adrian, a 44-year-old graduate of Harvard\nUniversity, would take over leadership of the family empire from his father.\u00a0\n\nAdrian is currently chief executive officer of New World Development Co., the\nfamily\u2019s flagship property business; Sonia Cheng, Henry\u2019s 43-year-old daughter,\nmanages the Rosewood hotel and Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd.; and Henry,\n76, controls Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd., the Chengs\u2019 unlisted family\ninvestment vehicle, with other relatives. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises holds major\nstakes in the clan\u2019s main businesses,\u00a0controlling\u00a0New World and the\u00a0Rosewood.\u00a0\n\nAs recently as 2020, Adrian\u2019s representatives were distributing a bio that\ndescribed him as \u201cthe heir to New World Development and Chow Tai Fook\nEnterprises, and the third generation leader of the $20.7 billion empire.\u201d Sonia\nidentified herself as chief executive officer of Rosewood around the same\nperiod.\n\nWhen asked about her father\u2019s remarks during an earnings briefing, Sonia \u2014 also\na Harvard grad \u2014 said her role at the jeweler provides a clear division of work\nwithin the company, and all family members work together for the benefit of the\nfirm. Conroy Cheng, Sonia\u2019s cousin and vice chairman of the jeweler, said\n\u201cthere\u2019s no such thing\u201d when asked about the possibility of family infighting.\nNew World declined to comment. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises didn\u2019t respond to a\nrequest for comment.\n\nThe patriarch\u2019s words matter in a succession process that may soon get under\nway, especially in a society that traditionally favors the eldest son.\u00a0\n\nHenry took over the business from his father Cheng Yu-tung, who built the\nconglomerate spanning shopping malls, casinos, hotels, and jewelry stores across\nHong Kong and mainland China. The group\u2019s holdings are among the signature\nproperties in Hong Kong, from the New World Tower to the Victoria Dockside\ncomplex.\u00a0\n\nThe sprawling empire has generated a fortune for Henry, whose net worth is\nalmost $21 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\u00a0\n\nUnder Adrian, New World has expanded aggressively in China and is working on two\nof the biggest retail developments in Hong Kong, including a $2.6 billion\nmall-office complex next to the airport.\u00a0\n\nThe strategy has come at a cost for New World, driving its debt load higher just\nas interest rates are soaring. The company\u2019s net debt to equity was 94% at the\nend of June, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That compares with 42% at\nrival Henderson Land Development Co., and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.\u2019s 18%.\n\n\u201cNew World\u2019s leverage is particularly high so there are more concerns for the\ncompany,\u201d said Patrick Wong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWhen the\nmarket sentiment is not good\u201d companies like New World are especially\nvulnerable, he said.\n\nNew World\u2019s stock has tumbled 47% this year to a 20-year low, compared with a\n14% drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. The developer\u2019s $1.3 billion\nperpetual bonds sold in 2019 traded at just 51 cents on the dollar.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s even after the Cheng family investment vehicle stepped in to alleviate\nthe builder\u2019s debt burden. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd. recently bought the\nmajority shares of NWS Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary, generating $2.8 billion for\nNew World.\u00a0\n\nChina\u2019s property meltdown represents another headwind for New World \u2014 and for\nAdrian. Its contracted sales from homes in the mainland accounted for almost\ntwo-thirds of total sales in the 12 months through June. By contrast,\nbillionaire Li Ka-shing\u2019s CK Asset Holdings Ltd. has trimmed its revenue from\nmainland China to just 11%.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWeathering the challenging macro business environment is very important for\nboth New World and Adrian Cheng,\u201d said Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at\nHong Kong-based VL Asset Management. \u201cIf he can resolve the difficulties, it\nwill solidify his position and future as a business leader.\u201d\n\n\nADRIAN\u2019S GAMBIT\n\nAdrian has certainly been on the move, modernizing his retail empire at a time\nwhen traditional malls are under siege. His vision includes building his\nflagship K11 malls into premium destinations with art and culture. He\u2019s bringing\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s first ever\u00a0fashion show\u00a0to Hong Kong this month, and introduced\nAsia\u2019s largest MoMA design store.\n\nHis crown jewel K11 MUSEA\u2019s foot traffic increased 67% in this first-half and\nmall sales increased 84%, the company said.\n\nAdrian\u2019s logic is that the future of retail isn\u2019t just about selling goods, it\u2019s\nabout the experience, especially for the deep-pocketed consumers he\u2019s chasing.\nThe company\u2019s top clients who spend more than HK$300,000 a year contributed\nHK$1.1 billion to sales last fiscal year, and tripled consumption from\npre-pandemic levels, according to a spokesperson.\u00a0\n\nAnd to underscore his legitimacy beyond overseeing money from friends and\nfamily, Adrian\u2019s private investment arm, C Capital, raised more than $250\nmillion for its Private Equity Fund III to back emerging consumer and technology\nfirms.\u00a0\n\nNew World is also selling assets to raise cash and is cutting debt, making\ndeleveraging the priority, Chief Financial Officer Edward Lau said in an\ninterview.\u00a0\n\nThe company plans to dispose of HK$6 billion in non-core assets in the fiscal\nyear through June, after selling HK$38 billion in the last three years. It also\nwill seek joint ventures to develop its 15 million square feet of land in Hong\nKong\u2019s Northern Metropolis to lower costs, while some plots could also be up for\nsale. It announced plans on Nov. 23 to spend as much as $600 million to buy back\nseven of its dollar bonds.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s volatility in the market, whether it\u2019s related to our company or\nnot, we will buy more,\u201d Lau said.\n\nRead more: New World May Only Slightly Cut Debt Cost on Bond Buyback: React\n\nStill, all the challenges facing Adrian are adding heft to his father\u2019s comments\nabout succession in a family where multiple siblings play active roles.\u00a0\n\nSonia sits atop both the hotel business and a publicly traded jewelry unit that\nhas a market value three times higher than New World.\u00a0\n\nTheir brothers Brian and Christopher serve as executive directors of the\nfamily\u2019s infrastructure arm NWS Holdings. Brian also sits on the board of New\nWorld. They also have two half-brothers. Henry\u2019s nephew-in-law, Patrick Tsang,\nserves as chief executive officer of Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s actually very encouraging to siblings other than simply Adrian\nCheng,\u201d Peng said, referring to Henry\u2019s comments. \u201cThey would feel better that\nthe father is quite inclusive to try to encourage them to join the family\u201d\nbusiness, she said.\u00a0\n\nRecommended Newsletter: CEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need\nto know from across the world of business.

Rosewood\nbelieves it will at a half-dozen of its ultra-luxury hotels.\n\nSean O'Neill\n\nRosewood Hotel Group, the ultra-luxury brand, has quietly launched a program\nthat sets a higher bar for meeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\ngoals.\n\nThe initiative, called Impact Trailblazers, spotlights hotels that pledge to\nachieve at least one of six stretch goals by 2025. Goals include reducing waste\nlike single-use plastics, sourcing supplies locally, and developing community\npartnerships to hire locally.\n\n\u201cThese properties are not just meeting our ambitious sustainability goals \u2014\nthey\u2019re exceeding them, showcasing that luxury and positive impact can be\nsynonymous,\u201d said Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed, vice president of social impact at\nRosewood Hotel Group, in an exclusive interview.\n\nRosewood hopes its half-dozen top performers inspire all of its hotels and the\nbroader industry. It operates 44 hotels and has over 30 in development.\n\nThe program claims to have some early results. Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo has achieved\n90% waste diversion, operates on 100% renewable energy, and has hired 45% of its\nworkforce from underserved groups. Rosewood Phuket sources all ingredients for\nits signature restaurant locally. Rosewood Mayakoba in Mexico supports a\nnon-profit school, while Rosewood Phnom Penh partners with a vocational training\nnon-profit in Cambodia.\n\nRosewood Mayakoba. Source: Rosewood.\n\n\nROSEWOOD\u2019S IMPACT\n\nHere are some of the early successes claimed by these hotels.\n\n * Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo\u00a0has achieved 90% waste diversion and operates on 100%\n   renewable energy. It has hired 45% of its workforce from underserved local\n   groups.\n\n * Rosewood Phuket\u00a0has been one of the local pioneers in environmental\n   sustainability, earning LEED Gold Certification and achieving local sourcing\n   goals. Its signature restaurant, Ta Khai, sources all ingredients locally,\n   supporting community farmers using sustainable practices.\n\n * Rosewood Mayakoba\u00a0revived a non-profit school in Riviera Maya that had\n   stopped functioning and now supports over 450 students. It recently added a\n   separate building for a new secondary school.\n\n * Rosewood Phnom Penh\u00a0partners with a local non-profit offering vocational\n   training to Cambodian youth, bringing in students for performances and\n   demonstrations of local artistic traditions.\n\n * Rosewood Baha Mar\u00a0focuses on coral conservation in The Bahamas, partnering\n   with the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation. The resort employs\n   95% local staff and promotes diversity and female representation at\n   supervisory levels.\n\n * Rosewood Hong Kong\u00a0introduced BluHouse, a restaurant concept that employs\n   refugees and ethnic minorities.\n\n\nHOTEL BUSINESS BENEFITS\n\nAhmed challenged the notion that doing good compromises business performance.\n\n\u201cThe travel sector accepts that there\u2019s a trade-off between doing well and doing\ngood far too easily,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cThe fact that two of our Impact Trailblazers\nproperties \u2014 Rosewood Hong Kong and Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 were recently featured\nin the latest 50 Best Hotels list shows that there\u2019s definitely not a trade-off\nin delivering luxury and having a positive social impact.\u201d\n\nThe efforts can also translate into enhancing guest loyalty.\n\n\u201cLuxury is a feeling,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the connection we create with our\nguests, and this can be fostered even without spelling out the social impact\npiece.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve stayed at Rosewood Mayakoba, you\u2019ll know that each guest receives a\nbeautiful little, colorful, folklore animal representative of Mayan culture,\u201d\nAhmed said. \u201cGuests have commented positively on these figurines. But what most\ndon\u2019t know is that these figures are special because they are carved through a\npartnership with a social enterprise that hires women recovery from domestic\nabuse.\u201d\n\nRosewood executives also believe that hotels with a social impact work have a\nbetter chance of attracting and retaining top talent.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has accelerated this trend of people wanting to know that the work\nthat they are doing most of the hours of their day is doing something positive\nfor the world,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\n\nACCOMMODATIONS SECTOR STOCK INDEX PERFORMANCE YEAR-TO-DATE\n\nWhat am I looking at?\u00a0The performance of hotels and short-term rental sector\nstocks within the\u00a0ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across\nglobal markets, including international and regional hotel brands, hotel REITs,\nhotel management companies, alternative accommodations, and timeshares.\n\nThe Skift Travel 200 (ST200)\u00a0combines the financial performance of nearly 200\ntravel companies worth more than a trillion dollars into a single number.

His son, and Cheng\u2019s father, Henry Cheng, is now chairman of\nthe businesses.\n\nAfter pursuing a career in banking and finance, Cheng, who graduated from\nHarvard with a major in applied mathematics, joined the family fold at the age\nof 28 to head up its hospitality business. In 2011, New World Hospitality\nacquired Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, then based in Texas, US, for a reported\nUS$229.5 million. Back then, while the Rosewood name was familiar among North\nAmerican travellers, it was not well-known on an international scale.\n\nUnder Cheng\u2019s leadership, Rosewood has since evolved into a global player in the\nluxury hospitality space, with openings in key cities including Beijing, London,\nAbu Dhabi, Munich and more. Its portfolio of 33 one-of-a-kind luxury hotels in\n21 countries also includes legendary properties such as The Carlyle in New York,\nand the Hotel de Crillon in Paris, both of which have undergone a transformation\nunder Rosewood.\n\nThere are currently another 27 hotels in the pipeline, with Cheng describing the\nnext two years as Rosewood\u2019s \u201cpeak opening years\u201d, where it will continue to\nexpand in Europe, Japan, the Middle East, China, Mexico, New Zealand and more.\n\u201cThe next couple of years is really exciting. Key gateway cities have always\nbeen our target, but we also explore new destinations and projects that we think\nfit the Rosewood philosophy. These projects may not be in gateway locations that\ntravellers expect, but I think what travellers are looking for in this day and\nage is for Rosewood to take them on a journey to explore new destinations.\u201d\n\nLink to source\n\nRead the full article at Rosewood Hotel Group",

        "content": "Rosewood Hotel Group, one of the world\u2019s leading global lifestyle and\nhospitality management groups, continues to expand its global footprint and\nevolve its four brands \u2013 Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\u00ae, New World\u00ae Hotels &\nResorts, Asaya, and Carlyle & Co.; and residential business, Rosewood\nResidences. Over the last five years, the Group has experienced ambitious yet\nthoughtful growth, with its ultra-luxury Rosewood Hotels & Resorts brand signing\nan impressive number of new deals compared to its competitive set. Following a\nmonumental 2023 which introduced the Group into new global territories,\nincluding New Zealand and Hawaii; and lifestyle categories, including\nexperiential retail; 2024 promises to deliver even more new deal signings,\nproperty openings and enriching experiences in the world\u2019s most inspiring\ndestinations.\n\n\nA GROWING, GLOBAL PRESENCE\n\nRosewood Hotel Group\u2019s combined portfolio now consists of 48 hotels, resorts,\nand residences across 23 countries, each embracing the brand's A Sense of Place\u00ae\nphilosophy to reflect the individual location's history, culture, and\nsensibilities. For Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, 2023 saw three properties open:\nRosewood Munich, Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort, and the brand\u2019s New Zealand\nlodge collection consisting of Rosewood Cape Kidnappers, Rosewood Kauri Cliffs\nand Rosewood Matakauri. These launches represented the Group\u2019s first flags in\nGermany, Hawai\u2019i, and New Zealand, respectively, and brought Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts\u2019 total hotel count to 33 properties across 21 countries. For New World\nHotels & Resorts, the past year featured the launches of three new properties,\nwhich was a record for this growing brand and brought the total portfolio count\nto 15 properties. This development further expanded New World\u2019s footprint in\nVietnam and China, raising the brand\u2019s flag in Hoi An, Taishan and Guangzhou.\n\nEqually as impressive as the Group\u2019s operational portfolio is its curated\npipeline of projects, each of which has been thoughtfully considered to inspire\nadventure and discovery. Today, Rosewood Hotel Group has 35 properties under\ndevelopment, reflecting one of the industry\u2019s strongest pipelines when\nconsidered as a percentage of a brand\u2019s complete portfolio. While the Group\u2019s\npipeline has been consistently impressive, it is the past five years which have\nmade a profound impact on the trajectory of the company globally and its status\nas a leader in the industry.\n\nSix new deal signings for Rosewood Hotels & Resorts in 2023 contributed to this\npositioning. These include Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\u2019 first-ever properties in\nBarbuda, Greece, South Korea and the Maldives, together underscoring the brand\u2019s\ncommitment to bringing its unique approach to hospitality to both cultural\ncapitals and exotic island destinations. Rosewood Amaala was also announced in\n2023, which will mark the brand\u2019s fourth property in Saudi Arabia upon opening.\nThe deal to manage the iconic Robertson Lodges in New Zealand was also penned in\n2023.\n\n\nAREAS OF EXPANSION\n\nThese additions reiterate Rosewood\u2019s strategic areas for expansion. Having just\ngrown its presence in Europe by 100% in less than three years, the region\ncontinues to be a key focus for the Group. 2024 will see the opening of Rosewood\nAmsterdam in the Netherlands and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl in Austria, followed in\n2025 by new properties in Greece, Venice, Milan, Rome, and a second London\nhotel, The Chancery Rosewood.\n\nThe Middle East\u2019s propensity for luxury hospitality has been similarly central\nto the Group\u2019s strategic future expansion, with several new properties set to\njoin its Middle Eastern portfolio. Building upon its current presence in Abu\nDhabi and Jeddah, Rosewood Doha will open its doors in Qatar this year. In the\nMiddle East, future growth is focused on Saudi Arabia, whose ongoing\ntransformation for a new era of travel aligns naturally with Rosewood\u2019s\ntrailblazing reputation for impeccable, first-class service. Three new hotels\nare set to debut in Saudi Arabia in the coming years: Rosewood Diriyah in 2025,\nalongside the future openings Rosewood Red Sea and Rosewood Amaala.\n\nThe pipeline for Rosewood Hotel Group also continues to grow in Asia Pacific,\nand in 2024 will see the opening of Rosewood Miyakojima, marking Rosewood\u2019s\nentry into Japan. New World Chongqing Hotel in China will also debut in the\nforeseeable future. Looking further ahead, future openings in China include\nRosewood Shenzhen, Rosewood Hangzhou, Rosewood Shanghai, Rosewood Chongqing,\nRosewood Ningbo, and Rosewood Xi\u2019An. In the greater Asia Pacific region,\nanticipated destinations include Rosewood Hoi An, Rosewood Seoul and Rosewood\nRanfaru in the Maldives.\n\nIn the Americas, development stretches across The United States, Mexico, and The\nCaribbean. 2025 will add Rosewood Mexico City and Rosewood Mandarina to the\ngrowing portfolio of properties in Mexico. Looking ahead, another icon will be\nreborn under the Rosewood flag with Rosewood The Raleigh in Miami Beach, which\nwill include 44 Rosewood Residences in a newly built Peter Marino-designed\nbuilding. Also consisting of both a resort and residential experience will be\nRosewood Barbuda, opening on the exquisite Caribbean island in 2028.\n\n\nENRICHED LIVING, EVERY DAY\n\nRosewood Hotels & Resorts' branded residential business, Rosewood Residences, is\na refined collection of estate homes, luxury villas and serviced apartments\ncarefully curated to enrich the lives of all who call them home. Currently\nconsisting of 14 properties across ten countries, this collection allows owners\nand guests to unlock an elevated lifestyle supported by the very best in design,\namenities, and service.\n\nFor the last several years, Rosewood Residences has been experiencing\nexceptional growth, with the number of projects in development currently sitting\nat an all-time high. The industry has taken notice: in the 2023 Brand Residences\nReport produced by Savills [1], one of the world\u2019s pioneering real estate\nadvisors and consultancies, Rosewood Residences ranked 4th in its competitive\nset of independent luxury brands in regard to the number of completed and\npipeline projects.\n\nA highlight of this pipeline is six standalone residential properties, the first\nof which was only announced in 2021. The rapid growth of Rosewood Residences\u2019\nstandalone properties is a further proof point of guests\u2019 growing desire to\naccess the Rosewood lifestyle beyond the hotel and resort experiences. In 2023,\ntwo such destinations were identified and announced: Rosewood Residences\nHillsboro Beach in Florida and Rosewood Residences Turtle Creek in Dallas,\nTexas. These newly announced projects join the additional standalone pipeline\nproperties of Rosewood Residences Naples and Rosewood Residences Lido Key, both\nin Florida; Rosewood Residences Kamala in Phuket, and Rosewood Residences\nBeverly Hills in California. The Beverly Hills property will open later this\nyear to officially debut the exclusively residential Rosewood experience.\n\nAlongside these standalone properties in the pipeline are four Rosewood\nResidences that will be co-located within a hotel or resort property, including\nRosewood Residences Mandarina, Rosewood Residences Miami Beach, Rosewood\nResidences Doha, and Rosewood Residences Barbuda.\n\nAcross both the standalone and mixed-use properties in operation as well as in\ndevelopment, the team is continuously raising the bar to deliver an elevated\nlifestyle experience that speaks to the unique needs of today\u2019s buyer. New and\ninnovative offerings introduced or announced by Rosewood Residences in the last\nyear include elevated food and beverage services, such as expert wine curation,\nprivate restaurants and bars, and curated in-home dining; dedicated shared and\nprivate spaces for visiting guests, younger residents, and pets; indoor and\noutdoor amenities and social areas designed specifically for entertaining; and,\nof course, a range of state-of-the-art wellness experiences. As wellness is a\ntop priority for many people today, Rosewood Residences has taken great care to\nintroduce new opportunities for residents and guests to stay well, from paddle\ntennis and pickleball courts, private salons and spas, to rooftop yoga pitches\nand pools.\n\nIn the end, Rosewood Residences\u2019 impressive growth of its physical footprint and\ninnovative offerings contributed to a 135% increase in sales year over year in\n2023, with total sales amounting to $434 million. This demand underscores that\nRosewood Residences are providing buyers with the type of modern-day living that\nthey are looking for and a community of which they wish to be an active\nparticipant.\n\n\nASAYA: INTEGRATED APPROACH TO WELLNESS\n\nAsaya, Rosewood\u2019s integrated, holistic health and wellness concept designed to\nunlock long-lasting and transformative well-being, will flourish in 2024 with\nnew launches and unique experiences. Since its inception at Rosewood Phuket in\n2017, Asaya has launched in five additional locations. Today, there is Asaya\nActive at Rosewood Guangzhou, Asaya Retreat at Rosewood Hong Kong, and Asaya Spa\nat Rosewood Vienna, Rosewood Munich, and Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort. The\nopenings in Munich and Hawai\u2019i in 2023 constitute growth of the Asaya concept by\n50%. This past year also saw 10% growth of Asaya\u2019s membership model, which is\navailable in certain urban destinations including Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and now\nMunich.\n\nUnderstanding how holistic well-being is foundational to a fulfilling life, the\nevolution of Asaya is of paramount importance to Rosewood Hotel Group in 2024\nand beyond. Today, there are 19 Asayas in the pipeline at both future and\nexisting Rosewood properties. In the coming year, seven will debut, reflecting\nthe brand\u2019s largest single-year expansion to date. All four of Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts\u2019 new 2024 openings \u2013 Rosewood Doha, Rosewood Miyakojima, Rosewood\nSchloss Fuschl, and Rosewood Amsterdam \u2013 will feature Asaya. This will mark the\nbrand\u2019s entry to The Middle East and Japan and double its count in Europe. In\naddition, existing properties Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo, Rosewood Mayakoba and Rosewood\nSand Hill will also introduce the Asaya experience. In keeping with the Rosewood\nbrand\u2019s guiding philosophy, each Asaya will offer immersive programming inspired\nby the destination in which it sits, with practices informed by local culture\nand heritage. Each new Asaya will further deliver exclusive treatments and\nproducts from some of the most innovative wellness brands in the world,\nincluding Dr. Barbara Sturm within Rosewood Doha and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl and\nGuerlain at Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo. These partnerships reflect the brand\u2019s\ncommitment to providing preeminent wellness experiences that are both\nestablished and innovative.\n\n\nRAREFIED RETAIL\n\nMarking the brand\u2019s growing presence as a luxury lifestyle brand, Rosewood\nHotels & Resorts continued its expansion into the retail space in 2023 with the\nlaunch of new e-commerce storefronts for nine of its hotels \u2013 including Rosewood\nSand Hill, Rosewood Miramar Beach, and Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort. This was\nthe most storefronts to launch in a single year since Rosewood first entered\ninto the e-commerce space in 2019, and brought the total number of platforms to\n13. These channels invite Rosewood aficionados to bring home an element of the\nhotel experience and purchase incredible experiences.\n\nIn 2023, Rosewood further strengthened its retail proposition through an\nexclusive partnership with The Webster, a luxury multi-brand retailer offering\nfashion, accessories, beauty and homeware. The partnership commenced with a\nsummer pop-up series across Rosewood Miramar Beach in California and Rosewood\nMansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, which invited Rosewood guests to shop\nexclusive collections inspired by these distinctive destinations. In celebration\nof the 2023 festive season, the partnership further included a bespoke retail\nedit to shop online. The edit consisted of The Webster\u2019s founder, Laure Heriard\nDubr\u00e9uil\u2019s personal picks for the holidays. This model will be expanded upon in\n2024, with Rosewood looking to launch unique product collaborations with leading\nbrands across the categories of fashion, wellness, home design, and more.",

Declines in the retail, lodging, and multifamily\nrates offset a small increase in industrial loans and a bigger increase for\noffices.\u00a0Office remains the most heavily watched part of the market as firms\nlook to aggressively reduce space. Sublease space is at or near record highs in\nmany markets as demand from big tech firms has eroded sharply. In addition, many\ncompanies are letting leases expire or are renewing for smaller footprints. The\nall-time high on this basis was 10.34% registered in July 2012.

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- Driven by a sense of purpose to build a future where people\nand place enrich one another, Rosewood Hotel Group is proud to announce\u00a0Rosewood\nImpacts, a groupwide roadmap for delivering positive impact on all its\ncommunities and the planet we call home. With deeper commitments to empowering\npeople across the brand's entire ecosystem and a sustainability approach that\nputs circular hospitality at the core of business operations, Rosewood Impacts\nis both a recognition of the group's ongoing programs and a strategic roadmap\nfor future efforts. With tangible goals in the fields of sustainability,\nemployment, partnerships and more, the comprehensive roadmap champions\nconsequential policies and programming under two distinct pillars: Rosewood\nEmpowers and Rosewood Sustains.\n\n\n\nRosewood Hotel Group is proud to announce Rosewood Impacts, a groupwide roadmap\nfor delivering positive impact on all its communities and the planet we call\nhome.\n\n\n\nRosewood Mayakoba\u2019s work with Centro Educativo K\u2019iin Beh, a non-profit school in\nthe Riviera Maya, Mexico.\n\n\n\nAn indisputable environmental steward, Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo is the centerpoint of\nthe Cidade Matarazzo Complex \u2013 the largest upcycling project of a century-old\nproperty in Brazil.\n\n\"At Rosewood Hotel Group, we are wholly committed to rooting ourselves more\ndeeply in every place we are in. With Rosewood Impacts, we are not only\nchampioning the exemplary efforts being made across our organization but setting\nnew benchmarks for positive impact that will propel us forward to a more\nsustainable and equitable tomorrow,\" says Sonia Cheng, Chief Executive Officer\nof Rosewood Hotel Group. \"We are proud of the work that our group has\naccomplished over the last forty-plus years of operations, but firmly maintain\nthat we must do more.\"\n\nRosewood Empowers\u00a0\nRosewood Empowers encapsulates the group's belief that equal access to\nopportunity is the key to uplifting communities. To this end, Rosewood is\ndedicated to:\n\n * Opportunity Employment, seeking talent from underserved or underrepresented\n   groups and working to lower barriers to employment.\n * Uplifting livelihoods by strengthening local economies through local hiring,\n   sourcing and partnerships.\n * Education, investing in our collective future by empowering people through\n   education and upskilling.\n\nThrough all Rosewood Empowers programs and initiatives, Rosewood's A Sense of\nPlace\u00ae philosophy ensures that the brand's efforts speak to and support the\ncommunities and environments where each property sits. An exemplary case study\nis Rosewood Mayakoba's work with Centro Educativo K'iin Beh, a non-profit school\nin the Riviera Maya, Mexico. With a mission to support not only the hotel\nemployees who needed adequate schooling for their children but the larger\ncommunity, the resort's leaders raised resources required to reopen the school\nin 2017, after a number of challenges threatened its ongoing operations and\nforced it to temporarily shut its doors. Today, the school welcomes over 400\nstudents, all of whom receive economic support for tuition and supplies through\nRosewood Mayakoba's scholarship program. The resort brings guests into the\nimpact journey through fundraising and a special volunteer and donation program,\n\"Padrino,\" that ensures the continued development of the students. In Fall 2022,\nguests' donations contributed to the development and launch of the center's new\nHigh School, allowing local youth to continue their education.\n\nIn Asia, Rosewood Hong Kong's commitment to the local community is further\nrealized through the BluHouse, Rosewood Hotel Group's first restaurant inspired\nby the concept of a business-with-purpose. BluHouse is committed to co-creating\nneighborhood resilience through donations, employment, and impactful experiences\nin support of underserved groups in Hong Kong. The restaurant has pledged 1% of\nrevenue towards this mission, and leverages the group's Opportunity Employment\nprogram to partner with NGOs to offer employment to refugees and ethnic\nminorities and close the opportunity gap.\n\nThe groupwide Opportunity Employment program is building a new pipeline of\ntalent from underserved groups not just in Hong Kong, but across its global\nportfolio in 20 countries. Properties from London and Vienna to Sao Paulo and\nPhuket are reaching out to the most overlooked groups in their neighborhoods,\nincluding minorities, people with disabilities refugees and others, and hiring\nfrom them. A newly launched program, Rosewood Bridges, is about connecting young\npeople from disadvantaged backgrounds with internships at the group's hotels.\nStarting with sending vocational students from the Hong Kong Vocational Training\nCouncil abroad for internships\u2014an opportunity not typically available in\nvocational education\u2014to partnering with local NGOs to give young people with\nautism a chance of a career at Rosewood Beijing or Guangzhou, the group is\nacting on its commitment to be a truly inclusive company.\n\nRosewood Sustains\u00a0\nRosewood Sustains showcases a commitment to growing Rosewood's lifestyle\necosystem responsibly and protecting the environment for future generations.\nFrom pursuing carbon neutrality, to engaging in regenerative practices, to\ndriving the evolution of circular hospitality and eventually eliminating waste,\nthe Group has set significant targets for environmental sustainability. These\ninclude:\n\n * Diverting 70% of waste away from landfills and incinerators by 2025.\n * Reducing energy use and water consumption by 25% by 2025.\n * Eliminating single-use plastics across the portfolio as soon as possible.\n * Achieving 50% carbon-neutral status by 2035 and complete carbon-neutral\n   status by 2050.\n\nAn indisputable environmental steward, Rosewood\u00a0S\u00e3o Paulo is the centerpoint of\nthe Cidade Matarazzo Complex \u2013 the largest upcycling project of a century-old\nproperty in Brazil. Supported by a dedicated solar farm as well as\ncollaborations with local government agencies, the hotel achieved its mission\nfor 100% of its energy supply to be fully sustainable in early January 2023,\nless than a year after opening. This will amount to an estimated savings of\n17.342 tons of CO2 emissions annually. Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo also vows to run a\nwaste management program where 100% of all solid and organic disposables will be\nrecycled and reused, and the property houses a biodigester and glass crushing\nmachine to minimize having to outsource these sustainable measures.\n\nIn The Bahamas, a nation of islands with 95% of its territory underwater,\nRosewood Baha Mar is preserving the pristine marine environment off Nassau's\nCable Beach through its partnership with The Bahamas Reef Environment\nEducational Foundation (BREEF) and educating the next generation of Bahamians\nand visitors on how to protect coral reefs, which are critical both for\necosystem preservation and for supporting local livelihoods dependent on\nfishing. Guests are invited to take a hands-on approach through Rosewood's\nCitizen Science Program, where they can enjoy a snorkeling adventure with\nexperienced ocean guides, with 100% of the proceeds going to BREEF. They can\nalso adopt coral fragments to plant within the surrounding waters and volunteer\nfor local beach clean-ups with the organization.\n\nAt the forthcoming Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort, opening on the Big Island of\nHawai'i this summer, the brand's principles of circular hospitality, operational\nsustainability, and environmental stewardship come together in a way that\nensures both the health of the environment and the longevity of culture.\u00a0A\ncommitment to the environment is evident throughout the entire property, which\nhas been designed for LEED Gold Certification and is powered by 100% solar\nenergy, while an on-site cultural center provides both visitors and locals with\nperspective into the rich natural and cultural significance of the surroundings.\n\nRosewood Sustains is being championed by the group's outstanding restaurants as\nwell. Caruso's at Rosewood Miramar Beach has truly put sustainability at its\ncore and been recognized for it through the award of a Green Michelin star.\nHelmed by Chef Massimo, who has built strong relationships with surrounding\nfarms, the restaurant sources most of its ingredients from a 5\u20136-mile radius\naround the resort and is committed to giving all food waste to farmers to use as\ncompost. Multiple properties including Rosewood Hong Kong, Rosewood Bermuda and\nRosewood London have partnered with EcoSpirits, a low-carbon, low-waste spirits\ndistributor, to champion circularity in the food and beverage space.\u00a0\n\n\"Both Rosewood Empowers and Rosewood Sustains have been designed to work in\nharmony together,\" Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed, Vice President of Social Impact for\nRosewood Hotel Group, explains. \"We are committed to doing business in a way\nthat drives the hospitality industry's evolution towards circularity and\nenvironmental conservation while simultaneously uplifting all our communities.\"\nExpressing excitement about the group's ambitions, she adds, \"our actions today\nhave a direct impact on the long-term viability of the planet. Being part of a\ncompany that's making it clear that our efforts can no longer be secondary but\nmust sit at the forefront of everything we do gives my hope for our collective\nfuture.\"\n\nRosewood Impacts represents the overall principle that true impact is the most\npowerful when the social and environmental are considered holistically. Through\nthis framework, the brand is able to measure its success and continue to set\nambitious benchmarks. Rosewood is proud of the advancements the entire group has\nmade towards the Rosewood Impacts mission, but recognizes that more must be\ndone, and is evolving every part of the business and operational strategies with\nthis in mind. With Rosewood Impacts at the leading edge, Rosewood Hotel Group\nlooks to the future with optimism.\n\nAbout Rosewood Hotel Group\nRosewood Hotel Group, a privately owned company, is one of the world's leading\nglobal lifestyle and hospitality management groups.

        "link": "https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-triple-play-growth-profit-and-sustainability",
        "content": "Consistent and profitable growth has been hard to achieve since the global\nfinancial crisis, making it critical for companies to explicitly choose\ngrowth\u00a0in their mindsets, pathways, and execution capabilities.1 Many executives\nbelieve making that growth sustainable and inclusive\u00a0requires inscrutable\ntrade-offs, forgoing revenue and profit for the sake of society and the planet.2\nThat is not always the case. Our new analysis indicates financially successful\ncompanies that integrate environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG)\npriorities into their growth strategies outperform their peers\u2014provided they\nalso outperform on the fundamentals. The message is clear: not only can you do\nwell while doing good\u2014you can do better.\n\nWe looked at TSR, financial performance, and ESG ratings of 2,269 public\ncompanies, separating them into industry outperformers and underperformers along\nthe axes of ESG scores, annualized revenue growth, and economic profit (see\nsidebar \u201cOur methodology\u201d). The analysis shows that companies that achieve\nbetter growth and profitability than their peers while improving sustainability\nand ESG outgrow their peers and exceed them in shareholder returns.3 These\n\u201ctriple outperformers\u201d delivered 2 percentage points of annual TSR above\ncompanies that only outperformed on financial metrics (and 7 percentage points\nabove the rest of the dataset), suggesting that a strong ESG commitment adds\nadditional shareholder value for companies that also exceed their peers in\ngrowth and profitability (Exhibit 1).4\n\n\n\nImportantly, excelling at ESG does not compensate for poor growth and\nprofitability. For example, growth and profit laggards that only outperformed on\nESG measures underperformed peers by five percentage points of TSR. In other\nwords, ESG is not a panacea\u2014it won\u2019t save an underperformer with a flawed\nstrategy. Additionally, the analysis does not imply that capital markets give\nvaluation premiums to triple outperformers, only that those companies\noutperformed on financial metrics.\n\n\nREVENUE + ECONOMIC PROFIT + ESG PROGRESS = OUTSIZE RETURNS\n\nStrong growth has been elusive over the past 15 years, with the world\u2019s largest\ncompanies growing at half the rate they did before 2008.5 Between 2017 and 2021,\nfewer than one in four companies in our sample achieved more than 10 percent\nrevenue growth annually. Triple outperformers fared much better, however, as\nmore than half grew by 10 percent or more (Exhibit 2).\n\n\n\nTriple outperformers increased their revenues at a median rate of 11 percent per\nyear\u20141.4 percentage points higher than the median achieved by profitable growth\noutperformers that lagged on ESG. Triple outperformers also exceeded profitable\ngrowth outperformers in median excess TSR by 2.5 percentage points.\n\nThe timeless principles of shareholder value creation hold: ESG efforts\nultimately have to show up in financial performance to create outsize returns.\nThe importance of actively choosing to grow by adopting the right mindset,\nstrategy, and capabilities also continues to be essential: If you can grow\nprofitably as a sustainability leader, the market will reward you for this\ngrowth. A recent McKinsey analysis, for example, shows that chemical players\nwith low-carbon product portfolios or high exposure to end markets supporting\nsustainability grew their shareholder returns at more than double the rate of\nsustainability laggards between 2016 and 2021.6 Similarly, mining players\ntapping into the growth opportunities associated with rising lithium demand from\ngreen technologies are getting a positive market reception.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all industries registered shareholder returns\ncorrelated with ESG-rating improvements during our study\u2019s time frame, and some\nof the gains may be affected by the current downturn (see sidebar \u201cImpact of the\nrecent market correction\u201d). The biggest shareholder gains accrued to triple\noutperformers in basic materials, advanced electronics, and the financial\nsector, likely due to shifting consumer preferences that supported \u201cgreen\npremiums\u201d and lowered risk around regulations and carbon-related costs. On the\nother hand, high tech and retail have not been able to realize benefits from\nstrong ESG rating improvements\u2014yet. Industry dynamics and the COVID-19 crisis\n(producing growth for high tech but a slump for retail) might have outweighed\nESG effects in these sectors. We believe, however, that the ESG performance bar\nis rising rapidly across sectors and regions. Furthermore, merely keeping pace\nwith your industry does not deliver market premiums\u2014investors reward companies\nthat improve their ESG ratings faster than peers in addition to outperforming on\nother dimensions.\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE THE GROWTH TRIPLE PLAY\n\nSo how do triple growth outperformers manage that feat? They tend to be guided\nby five principles: integrating growth, profitability, and ESG into the core\nstrategy; innovating ESG offerings to drive value creation; using M&A to rapidly\ncapture ESG growth pockets; tracking and reporting ESG and related data\ntransparently; and embedding strategic priorities in the organizational DNA.\n\nIntegrate growth, profitability, and ESG into the core strategy. Top performers\ndon\u2019t pursue ESG-related initiatives on the side but integrate them into the\noverarching corporate strategy alongside growth and profitability. Consider the\nexample of a metals and mining triple outperformer that has focused its strategy\nand investments on decarbonization as a way to fulfill all three objectives. The\ncompany divested its coal-based business and shifted toward materials supporting\nthe energy transition. To raise top-line growth, it set up a ring-fenced budget\nfor investments in green aluminum, green steel, carbon-capture solutions, and\nother fast-growing markets. In parallel, it undertook multiple initiatives on\nthe social dimension aimed at reducing the risk of regulatory and legal\ninterventions while improving employee productivity. For example, it implemented\na plan to create a safer, more inclusive work environment and addressed its\nlocal impact through agreements with Indigenous people and local communities.\n\nInnovate ESG offerings to drive value creation. Triple outperformers often\noperate on the cutting edge of innovation, both in what they do and how they do\nit. Many focus their innovation efforts primarily on top-line growth by\ndeveloping offerings to better meet customer needs\u2014and, where possible, serve\nemerging demand grounded in ESG.\n\nThat can involve creating solutions for business customers to help those clients\nmeet their own ESG-related customer or regulatory needs. One European transport\nand logistics provider, for example, turned to innovation to help it capture the\nESG lead in its industry as the topic was gaining stakeholder attention. It\nopted to focus on helping its customers reduce the carbon footprint in their\nsupply chains. The company created an innovation hub to guide global initiatives\nand set up a technology trend tracking mechanism to stay abreast of emerging\ntechnologies. It is also collaborating with external sustainability,\ndigitization, and innovation experts to develop solutions customized to its\ncustomers\u2019 supply chain challenges. This investment has produced new\npremium-priced offerings for carbon reporting and offsetting, sustainable fuel,\nand supply chain design and optimization, significantly boosting its revenue. As\na result, the company has translated its industry first-mover advantage on ESG\ninto 20 percent higher annual revenue growth than its peers while also realizing\n20 percent annualized excess TSR since 2017.\n\nUse M&A to capture profitable ESG growth pockets at an accelerated pace.\nProgrammatic M&A\u00a0can accelerate companies\u2019 entry into new areas of growth.7\nSuccessful players have tended to look for underserved adjacent growth pockets\nand allocate ring-fenced funds to capture these opportunities. Many triple\noutperformers go a step further by integrating ESG criteria alongside existing\nfinancial and market criteria into their evaluation of potential adjacencies and\nM&A target selection.\n\nOne multinational cosmetics company, for example, developed a reputation for a\nhigh focus on sustainability and inclusion by shifting its asset portfolio\ntoward ESG-oriented offerings. Over a decade, it acquired a dozen innovative\nfirms, adding both luxury brands that offer sustainable, inclusive products and\nservices and expanding into new areas such as women\u2019s health tech. By leveraging\nsynergies between the brands, it captured growth pockets both within its core\nbusiness and in adjacent segments. In the process, the company\u2019s ESG ratings\nsoared by 39 percentage points during the period of our study, and investors\nboosted its shareholder returns by 25 percent per year above its industry\naverage.\n\nReport and communicate transparently. We often hear business leaders express\nfrustration that capital markets fail to recognize and reward their companies\u2019\ninvestments in initiatives with longer time horizons, which is often true for\nESG-related growth ventures. While there are numerous reasons why that may be\nthe case, rigorous reporting and proactive communication to the investment\ncommunity of how these initiatives boost value, along with the targets and\nprogress, are critical to gaining those rewards. Communication alone will not\ndrive value, but transparency can accelerate investors\u2019 recognition of future\npotential. Once a company has set clear and ambitious goals, it needs to\ncontinuously demonstrate where the value comes from and show strides on related\ninitiatives\u2014with external validation where possible\u2014for progress to be credible\nin consumers\u2019 and investors\u2019 minds.\n\nFor example, one European software provider created a user-friendly interactive\ntool that publicly tracks its progress on key ESG metrics alongside its\nfinancial performance. The dashboard is particularly robust in tracking the \u201cS,\u201d\nor social, dimension, which the company has prioritized. For example, the gender\nratios of its workforce can be viewed not only by seniority but also by the\nnumber of part-time versus full-time workers and permanent versus temporary\nworkers. A multinational automotive technology supplier, meanwhile, continually\nreinforces the link between its technology and sustainability strategy to\nexternal stakeholders, closely tying its sustainability and ESG goals to\nstrategic objectives such as market growth, productivity, and customer\nsatisfaction.\n\nEmbed strategic priorities in the organizational DNA. Triple outperformers\ntranslate their high-level growth, profitability, and ESG strategies into\nconcrete initiatives that form part of the new corporate strategy. Management\nteams set out clear responsibilities, performance metrics, and targets and\nmeasure them rigorously. They also reallocate their resources toward these new\nopportunities and ensure that internal processes encourage business leaders to\nintegrate the relevant criteria\u2014including ESG\u2014into their decisions.\n\nFor example, a global shipping player that achieved triple outperformance\nensured its strategy was fully embedded into the organization. The company set\nup committees at all levels, from the board of directors to operations, to\nholistically assess the most metrics, including growth, profitability and ESG.\nAdditionally, the organization linked remuneration to key ESG targets and built\npartnerships with customers to codevelop new green solutions. Its strong focus\non governance has not only helped it to increase revenue growth but also to\noptimize cost and prepare for potential legislative interventions, such as\ncarbon emissions taxes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile ESG performance measurement is still evolving, the direction of travel is\nclear, and action is needed now. Leaders need to take a long-term perspective\nand have the courage to invest in sustainable and inclusive growth that delivers\nrevenue, economic profit, and shareholder returns.\n\nRebecca Doherty is a partner in McKinsey\u2019s Bay Area office, Claudia Kampel is an\nassociate partner in the Stuttgart office, Anna Koivuniemi is an alumna of the\nAmsterdam office, Lucy P\u00e9rez is a senior partner in the Boston office, and\nWerner Rehm\u00a0is a partner in the New Jersey office.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Donatela Bellone, Michael Birshan, Marc Goedhart,\nTheresa Krause, Lazar Krstic, Karin L\u00f6ffler, Devesh Mittal, Valdo Nunes, Robin\nNuttall, Tido R\u00f6der, Sven Smit, Paul Ziesche, and Jill Zucker for their\ncontributions to this article.\n\nEXPLORE A CAREER WITH US",

        "content": "Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development and NWS Holdings.\n\nSouth China Morning Post via Getty Images\n\nThe private investment company of Hong Kong\u2019s billionaire Cheng family, Chow Tai\nFook Enterprises, proposed on Tuesday a buyout of up to HK$35.5 billion ($4.5\nbillion) for NWS Holdings, the infrastructure arm of the family\u2019s property giant\nNew World Development.\n\nChow Tai Fook Enterprises said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange\nthat it\u2019s offering HK$9.15 apiece to acquire the shares it does not already own\nin NWS. This includes a 60.9% stake held by New World Development that would\nlighten the debt load of the property developer. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises\ncurrently directly owns about 2.5% of NWS.\n\nChow Tai Fook Enterprises said the offer represents a premium of 14.5% over its\nlast traded price of HK$7.99 on Friday before its shares were suspended. It also\ntranslates to a premium of 30.9% over its average closing price of HK$6.99 for\nthe 30 trading days prior to the trading halt, according to the statement. NWS\nsaw its shares jump 10.3% in the Tuesday morning session after they resumed\ntrading.\n\nThe offer will \u201cimmediately strengthen New World Development\u2019s financial\nposition\u201d and \u201cenhance the strategic focus of New World Development on property\ndevelopment, property investment and property related businesses,\u201d the statement\nsaid. New World Development will receive about HK$21.8 billion from the shares\ndisposal.\n\nChow Tai Fook Enterprises may exercise its right to take NWS private if certain\nconditions are met, including acquiring at least 90% of NWS shares it does not\nalready own, according to the statement. Henry Cheng, the eldest son of New\nWorld founder Cheng Yu-tung, is a director of Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, and the\nchairman of both New World and NWS.\n\nThe buyout comes as New World Development continues to step up its disposal of\nnon-core assets to lower debt amid spiking interest rates and tumbling property\nprices. The real estate giant has said it aims to offload HK$10 billion worth of\nnon-core assets during the financial year ended June.\n\nNWS is the industrial flagship of New World Development with businesses spanning\ntoll roads, construction and insurance. The company reported a 7.8% year-on-year\nincrease in revenue to HK$17.6 billion in the six months ended December,\naccording to its latest earnings report. It recorded a 26.6% decrease in net\nprofit to HK$1.2 billion during the same period.\n\nChow Tai Fook Enterprises has its roots in Chow Tai Fook Jewellery established\nin the 1920s. The private investment behemoth said it has interests in prime\nreal estate, hospitality services, energy, media, as well as in growing tech\ncompanies, among others.

While NWD\u2019s net gearing ratio of 47% stayed elevated even\nafter factoring in NWS\u2019 business spinoff, we view the firm\u2019s liquidity risk as\nmanageable given limited short-term refinancing needs and pressure on cash flow.\nAs soft homebuying demand in Hong Kong and mainland China should persist, we\ntrim our forecast of NWD\u2019s average selling price for residential projects, as\nwell as of the gross margins and dividend payout through fiscal 2028, but are\nmore positive on investment properties\u2019 earnings amid retail sales pickup and\nfloor area expansion. Despite our valuation revision, NWD\u2019s shares remain\nslightly underpriced as we think the recent selloff on financing concerns is\noverdone.\n\nWith tourist traffic resuming in the first half of 2023, NWD saw a mild\ninvestment property income rebound of 4% year on year for fiscal 2023.

        "content": "NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT OFFERS TO BUY BACK US$600 MILLION OF BONDS AFTER\nCOMPLETING A US$2.8 BILLION ASSET SALE TO CONTROLLING FAMILY\n\n\n\nNew World Development offered to buy back as much as US$600 million of its\noutstanding dollar-denominated debt through a public tender to manage its debt\nload, days after receiving HK$21.8 billion (US$2.8 billion) from an asset sale\nto its controlling family.\n\nThe Hong Kong developer offered to repurchase part of five bonds maturing\nbetween 2027 and 2031 and two perpetual securities with a combined outstanding\nface amount of US$4.14 billion, according to a stock exchange filing on\nThursday. The offer prices exclude accrued interest on the bonds.\n\nThe cash offer will be based on a modified Dutch auction, meaning the developer\nwill accept lowest prices first until the maximum buyback amount is reached. The\noffer closes on December 1 with results expected on December 4, barring any\nextension. The firm may choose not to accept any of the offer tendered by\nbondholders, it added.\n\n\n\n(Left to right): Adrian Cheng Chi-kong, executive vice-chairman and Henry Cheng\nKar-shun, chairman, of New World Development, seen during a media briefing in\nFebruary 2019 in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. Photo: Winson Wong\n\n\u201cThe rationale is to optimise the cost of capital and debt profile,\u201d chairman\nHenry Cheng Kar-shun said in the exchange filing. \u201cThe offer also provides\nliquidity to investors at premium to market price.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs, HSBC, Mizuho Securities and UBS have been appointed as dealer\nmanagers, while Orient Securities will be co-dealer manager.\n\n\u201cThe buyback is a positive catalyst to support bond prices and refinancing its\nmaturing bonds,\u201d said Tommy Kung, an analyst at KGI Asia. Still, the plan would\nhave a \u201climited impact\u201d on its financial position, as the buy-back amount is\nsmall relative to US$24.3 billion of its interest-bearing debt, he added.\n\nNew World, controlled by Hong Kong\u2019s third-richest billionaire family led by the\n76-year old Cheng, has been looking to cut its debts as sliding home prices and\nhigher borrowing costs pressured its finances. The developer this week completed\nthe sale of its 60.9 per cent stake in NWS Holdings to a family-owned entity for\nHK$21.8 billion.\n\nThe Group had HK$54.5 billion of cash on June 30 and consolidated net debt of\nHK$130.8 billion, or a gearing ratio of 48.7 per cent, according to its latest\nfinancial report, an increase from 43.2 per cent a year earlier. It had HK$14.7\nbillion of loans due within 12 months.\n\nConcerns about the group\u2019s debt burden, which is among the highest for Hong Kong\ndevelopers, have weighed on its stock price and slashed its market value by 76\nper cent from the peak in 2019. Its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to HK$13.32 in\nHong Kong trading on Thursday, bringing the losses this year to 40 percent.\n\nIn the public tender, New World offered to pay 76 cents to 90 cents on the\ndollar for the five straight bonds, versus their indicative market prices of 72\nto 87 cents, according to Bloomberg data. It offered 60 and 87.5 cents on the\ndollar for the perpetual notes, versus their market levels of 57 cents and 84\ncents, respectively.\n\n",

        "title": "Emerging Market Economy: Definition, How It Works, and Examples ",
        "link": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp",
        "content": "WHAT IS AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY?\n\nAn emerging market economy is the economy of a developing nation that's becoming\nmore engaged with global markets as it grows. Countries classified as emerging\nmarket economies are those with some but not all of the characteristics of a\ndeveloped market.\n\nCharacteristics of developed markets can include strong economic growth, high\nper capita income, liquid equity and debt markets, accessibility by foreign\ninvestors, and a dependable regulatory system.\n\nIt typically becomes more integrated with the global economy as an emerging\nmarket economy develops. It can have increased liquidity in local debt and\nequity markets, increased trade volume, and foreign direct investment. It can\ndevelop modern financial and regulatory institutions. Some notable emerging\nmarket economies include India, Mexico, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and\nBrazil.\n\nAn emerging market economy is transitioning from a low-income, less developed,\noften pre-industrial economy toward a modern, industrial economy with a higher\nstandard of living.\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * An emerging market economy is one that's transitioning into a developed\n   economy.\n * Emerging market economies typically feature a unified currency, stock market,\n   and banking system. They're in the process of industrializing.\n * Emerging market economies can offer greater returns to investors due to their\n   rapid growth.\n * They also offer greater exposure to some inherent risks due to their status.\n * Emerging markets typically adopt reforms that are seen in developed markets\n   over time.\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY\n\nInvestors seek emerging markets for the prospect of high returns because these\nmarkets often experience faster economic growth as measured by gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Higher returns usually come with much greater risk, however.\n\n\nRISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS\n\nRisks can include political instability, domestic infrastructure problems,\ncurrency volatility, and illiquid equity because many large companies may still\nbe state-run or private. Local stock exchanges might not offer liquid markets to\noutside investors.\n\nEmerging markets generally don't have highly developed market and regulatory\ninstitutions like those found in developed nations. Market efficiency and strict\nstandards in accounting and securities regulation are generally not on par with\nadvanced economies such as those of the United States, Europe, and Japan.\n\n\nSIGNS OF PROGRESS\n\nEmerging markets typically have a physical financial infrastructure, including\nbanks, a stock exchange, and a unified currency. A key aspect of emerging market\neconomies is that they adopt reforms and institutions like those of modern\ndeveloped countries over time. This promotes economic growth.\n\nEmerging market economies tend to move away from activities that are focused on\nagricultural and resource extraction toward industrial and manufacturing\nactivities instead. Their governments usually pursue deliberate industrial and\ntrade strategies to encourage economic growth and industrialization. These\nstrategies include export-led growth and import-substituting industrialization.\n\nExport-led growth is more typical of economies that are considered emerging\nbecause it promotes more engagement and trade with the global economy. Emerging\nmarket countries also often pursue domestic programs such as investing in\neducational systems, building physical infrastructure, and enacting legal\nreforms to secure investors' property rights.\n\n\nFRONTIER MARKETS\n\nFrontier markets are usually smaller than emerging markets with lower per capita\nincome, less market liquidity, and less industrialization. They offer attractive\ninvestment opportunities but frontier markets are considered riskier for\ninvestors than emerging markets.\n\n\nHOW EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES ARE CLASSIFIED\n\nEmerging market economies are classified in various ways. Levels of income,\nquality of financial systems, and growth rates are all popular criteria but the\nexact list of emerging market economies can vary depending on who you ask.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) classifies 20 countries as emerging\nmarkets. Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) classifies 24 countries as\nemerging markets. Standard and Poor's (S&P), FTSE Russell, and Dow Jones also\nvary slightly in their classification of countries as emerging markets.\n\nA country can be removed from the list by either upgrading it to developed\nnation status or downgrading it to a frontier nation at any of these\ninstitutions' discretion. Developed nations may likewise be downgraded to an\nemerging market as was the case with Greece. Frontier markets such as Qatar and\nArgentina may be upgraded to emerging markets.\n\n\nWHAT'S AN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMY?\n\nAn emerging market economy is generally considered an economy that's\ntransitioning into a developed market economy. It has rapid GDP growth, growing\nper capita income, increasing debt and equity markets liquidity, and an\nestablished financial system infrastructure.\n\n\nWHAT COUNTRIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EMERGING MARKETS?\n\nClassifications differ but the so-called BRICS countries represent five emerging\nmarkets with major economic growth and opportunities for investment: Brazil,\nRussia, India, China, and South Africa. The GDPs of these countries have\nincreased steadily from 2000 through 2023. Data for 2024 isn't yet available.\n\nThat trend is expected to continue through the years ahead.\n\n\nDO EMERGING MARKETS MAKE GOOD INVESTMENTS?\n\nThey can make good investments due to their propensity for rapid GDP growth\ncompared to more mature markets but investing in emerging markets can be risky\ndue to potential political instability, lack of dependable information, currency\nfluctuations, lower liquidity, and investment volatility.\n\nInvestors should carefully weigh potential risks and rewards before making any\ninvestment.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nCountries that are classified as emerging market economies are those with\neconomies that are transitioning into being developed. They have a unified\ncurrency, stock market, and banking system, and they're in the process of\nindustrializing.\n\nEmerging market economies can be attractive to investors due to their rapid\ngrowth and greater returns but they also involve greater exposure and risk due\nto political instability or currency fluctuation.",

        "link": "https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-plans-to-expand-investment-in-parks-business/",
        "content": "The Walt Disney Company is developing plans to accelerate and expand investment\nin its Parks, Experiences and Products segment to nearly double capital\nexpenditures over the course of approximately 10 years to roughly $60 billion,\nincluding by investing in expanding and enhancing domestic and international\nparks and cruise line capacity.\n\nToday, Senior Disney executives, including Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and\nDisney Parks, Experiences and Products Chairman Josh D\u2019Amaro, gathered with Wall\nStreet analysts and investors at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida\nfor an investor summit focused on Disney\u2019s Parks business and its track record\nof investing aggressively and intelligently in experiences that leverage the\npowerful and ever-growing library of Disney stories, which has proven incredibly\neffective.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly mindful of the financial underpinning of the company, the need\nto continue to grow in terms of bottom line, the need to invest wisely so that\nwe\u2019re increasing the returns on invested capital, and the need to maintain a\nbalance sheet, for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Bob Iger. \u201cThe company is able to\nabsorb those costs and continue to grow the bottom line and look expansively at\nhow we return value and capital to our shareholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have an ambitious growth story that is supported by a proven track record\nand a bold vision for the future of our Parks business,\u201d said D\u2019Amaro.\n\nCentral to the business\u2019s growth strategy will be a focus on stories, scale, and\nfans.\n\nSTORIES\n\nAll over the world, Disney leverages its incomparable library of intellectual\nproperty through immersive storytelling experiences in its Parks and Resorts, on\nboard its cruise ships, and through its consumer products and licensing\nbusiness. The Parks business serves as a powerful platform where Disney\u2019s\nbeloved stories come to life in innovative ways, and where fans across\ngenerations and geographies can connect with and explore the Disney brands and\nfranchises they love, from Avatar to Zootopia, and everything in between.\n\nDisney continuously reimagines its theme park offerings to appeal to more guests\nby incorporating new stories from its popular films and series. Disney Parks has\nseen growth following previous periods of significant investment, which included\nthe additions of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure, Star Wars Galaxy\u2019s\nEdge at Disneyland Resort and Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World,\nAvengers Campus at Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park in\nParis, and more.\n\nToday, as Disney considers future growth opportunities, there is a deep well of\nstories that have yet to be fully explored in its theme parks.\n\nAlready, new Frozen-themed lands are coming to Hong Kong Disneyland, Walt Disney\nStudios Park in Paris and Tokyo Disney Resort, as well as a Zootopia-themed land\nat Shanghai Disney Resort. However, Disney will explore even more characters and\nfranchises, including some that haven\u2019t been leveraged extensively to date, as\nit embarks on a new period of significant growth domestically and\ninternationally in its parks and resorts.\n\n\u201cWe have a wealth of untapped stories to bring to life across our business,\u201d\nsaid D\u2019Amaro. \u201cFrozen, one of the most successful and popular animated\nfranchises of all time, could have a presence at the Disneyland Resort. Wakanda\nhas yet to be brought to life. The world of Coco is just waiting to be explored.\nThere\u2019s a lot of storytelling opportunity.\u201d\n\nSCALE\n\nToday, Disney has the largest physical footprint of any global theme park travel\nbusiness, with 12 parks across six sites around the world.[1] Its newest resort,\nShanghai Disney Resort, opened in 2016. Disney Cruise Line visits 94 ports in 40\ncountries, and Disney\u2019s industry-leading consumer products division brings\nDisney IP into fans\u2019 homes across the globe.\n\nNotably, Walt Disney World Resort is twice the size of the island of Manhattan,\nDisneyland is the most \u201cInstagrammed\u201d place on Earth, and tens of millions of\nguests travel on Disney\u2019s transportation networks each year.\n\nDisney\u2019s Parks business is a key driver of value creation for the company, and\npositive segment results in recent past quarters through FY23Q3 have come in\npart from strong performance at Disney\u2019s international parks, particularly those\nin Asia. Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland, which have both shown\nmeaningful growth coming out of the pandemic through Q3 FY23, have even further\ngrowth opportunities with the expansions set to open later this year.\n\nHowever, in addition to development plans already underway, there is significant\nroom for further expansion on land and at sea.\n\n\u201cWe stand alone when it comes to scale,\u201d said D\u2019Amaro. \u201cAnd while our scale is\nimpressive, we have no shortage of space or regions of the world in which to\ntell new stories.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Disney Parks has over 1,000 acres of land for possible future\ndevelopment to expand theme park space across its existing sites \u2013 the\nequivalent of about seven new Disneyland Parks.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney Cruise Line serves as a powerful ambassador for the brand in\nports and markets around the globe beyond its theme parks, including Australia\nand New Zealand for the first time later this year, extending the reach of\nDisney\u2019s high-quality experiences. As previously announced, over the next two\nyears, Disney will nearly double the worldwide capacity of its cruise line,\nadding two ships in fiscal year 2025 and another in 2026, delivering even\nfurther growth potential and introducing new markets to Disney experiences,\nincluding a new homeport in Singapore beginning in 2025 to expand its reach\nfurther into the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nFANS\n\nToday, Disney has seven of the top ten most attended theme parks in the world,\nincluding Walt Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom Park, which has been the #1 attended\ntheme park on earth for decades. Disney Parks welcome approximately 100 million\nguests each year.\n\nYet there is still enormous untapped potential for reaching more consumers.\nAccording to Disney\u2019s internal research, there is an addressable market of more\nthan 700 million people with high Disney affinity it has yet to reach with its\nParks. In fact, for every one guest who visits a Disney Park, there are more\nthan ten people with Disney affinity who do not visit the Parks.[2]\n\n\u201cUltimately what is most important to us is the relationship that we have with\nevery guest,\u201d said D\u2019Amaro. \u201cGuests can spend a day with us at our Parks, a week\nwith us on a Cruise, or the rest of their lives with us through Disney Vacation\nClub membership.\u201d\n\nAs Disney expands its footprint and offerings, not only will the company be able\nto reach more of its existing fans, but it will create new fans and loyal\nconsumers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the company develops plans to accelerate and expand investment in its Parks\nbusiness, it looks forward to introducing fans to more of the most powerful\ncharacters and stories, expanding its global footprint, advancing its\nstate-of-the-art commercial capabilities, and leveraging its unmatched global\ntalent to forge relationships with new generations of fans around the world.\n\n\u201cThroughout our history, we\u2019ve created enormous growth by investing the right\namount of capital into the right projects at the right moment,\u201d said Iger. \u201cWe\nare planning to turbocharge our growth yet again with a robust amount of\nstrategic investment in this business.\u201d\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements in this post may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\nincluding statements regarding expectations; strategy or focus; guidance;\u00a0\npriorities; plans or opportunities (including for expansion and growth) and\npotential impact on future performance; potential future growth or performance\nand anticipated drivers of growth or performance; future capital expenditures;\ntrends; drivers of demand; goals; product or service offerings (including\nnature, timing and pricing); consumer sentiment, behavior or demand; total\naddressable market and related drivers; value of our intellectual property; and\nother statements that are not historical in nature.

        "content": "UNDERSTANDING THE DIVIDEND DYNAMICS OF NWWDF\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd () recently announced a of $0.2 per share, payable\non 2024-04-18, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-03-20. As investors look\nforward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's\ndividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's\ndelve into New World Development Co Ltd's dividend performance and assess its\nsustainability.\n\n\nWHAT DOES NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD DO?\n\n * \n * \n\n * This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years\n\n * How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nNew World Development, or NWD, is the listed property arm of Chow Tai Fook,\nowned by the Cheng family. Chow Tai Fook owns a 45% stake in NWD, which mainly\nengages in residential property development and investment properties of retail\nmalls and offices in Hong Kong and mainland China. NWD also develops high-end\nhotels across Hong Kong, mainland China, and in Southeast Asia. Additionally,\nNWD holds a 75% interest in New World Department Store China, which operates 24\ndepartment stores in mainland China.\n\n\n\n\nA GLIMPSE AT NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND HISTORY\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd has maintained a consistent record since 1999.\nDividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart\nshowing annual for tracking historical trends.\n\n\nBREAKING DOWN NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND YIELD AND GROWTH\n\nAs of today, New World Development Co Ltd currently has a 12-month of 8.09% and\na 12-month of 4.26%. This suggests an expectation of decreased dividend payments\nover the next 12 months.\n\nOver the past three years, New World Development Co Ltd's annual was -1.30%.\nExtended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 1.20% per year. And over\nthe past decade, New World Development Co Ltd's annual dividends per share\ngrowth rate stands at 3.10%.\n\nBased on New World Development Co Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth\nrate, the of New World Development Co Ltd stock as of today is approximately\n8.59%.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUSTAINABILITY QUESTION: PAYOUT RATIO AND PROFITABILITY\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the\ncompany's payout ratio. The provides insights into the portion of earnings the\ncompany distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company\nretains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of\nfunds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, New World\nDevelopment Co Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 2.77, which may suggest that the\ncompany's dividend may not be sustainable.\n\nNew World Development Co Ltd's , offers an understanding of the company's\nearnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks New World Development Co\nLtd's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability\nprospects. The company has reported positive for each year over the past decade,\nfurther solidifying its high profitability.\n\n\nGROWTH METRICS: THE FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth\nmetrics. New World Development Co Ltd's of 7 out of 10 suggests that the\ncompany's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and New World Development Co Ltd's ,\ncombined with the , indicates a strong revenue model. New World Development Co\nLtd's revenue has increased by approximately 17.90% per year on average, a rate\nthat outperforms approximately 75.09% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical\ncomponent for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years,\nNew World Development Co Ltd's earnings increased by approximately 17.30% per\nyear on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 68.78% of global\ncompetitors.\n\nLastly, the company's of -35.80%, which outperforms approximately 4.42% of\nglobal competitors, presents a mixed picture but does not overshadow the\ncompany's overall strong performance.\n\n\nENGAGING CONCLUSION: EVALUATING NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT CO LTD'S DIVIDEND\nPROSPECTS\n\nIn conclusion, New World Development Co Ltd's upcoming dividend payment, along\nwith its historical dividend performance, presents an interesting case for\ninvestors. While the dividend growth rate and high yield on cost are attractive,\nthe low payout ratio raises questions about the dividend's sustainability.\nHowever, the company's solid profitability and positive growth metrics provide\nconfidence in its ability to sustain dividends. Investors should weigh these\nfactors carefully and consider New World Development Co Ltd's overall financial\nhealth when making investment decisions. Will the company continue to reward\nshareholders with consistent dividend payments?

        "link": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/mckinseys-private-markets-annual-review",
        "content": "AT A GLANCE\n\n\nMACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES CONTINUED\n\nIf 2022 was a tale of two halves, with robust fundraising and deal activity in\nthe first six months followed by a slowdown in the second half, then 2023 might\nbe considered a tale of one whole. Macroeconomic headwinds persisted throughout\nthe year, with rising financing costs, and an uncertain growth outlook taking a\ntoll on private markets. Full-year fundraising continued to decline from 2021\u2019s\nlofty peak, weighed down by the \u201cdenominator effect\u201d that persisted in part due\nto a less active deal market. Managers largely held onto assets to avoid selling\nin a lower-multiple environment, fueling an activity-dampening cycle in which\ndistribution-starved limited partners (LPs) reined in new commitments.\n\nPerformance in most private asset classes remained below historical averages for\na second consecutive year. Decade-long tailwinds from low and falling interest\nrates and consistently expanding multiples seem to be things of the past. As\nprivate market managers look to boost performance in this new era of investing,\na deeper focus on revenue growth and margin expansion will be needed now more\nthan ever.\n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL FUNDRAISING CONTRACTED\n\nFundraising fell 22 percent across private market asset classes globally to just\nover $1 trillion, as of year-end reported data\u2014the lowest total since 2017.\nFundraising in North America, a rare bright spot in 2022, declined in line with\nglobal totals, while in Europe, fundraising proved most resilient, falling just\n3 percent. In Asia, fundraising fell precipitously and now sits 72 percent below\nthe region\u2019s 2018 peak.\n\nDespite difficult fundraising conditions, headwinds did not affect all\nstrategies or managers equally. Private equity (PE) buyout strategies posted\ntheir best fundraising year ever, and larger managers and vehicles also fared\nwell, continuing the prior year\u2019s trend toward greater fundraising\nconcentration.\n\n\nTHE NUMERATOR EFFECT PERSISTED\n\nDespite a marked recovery in the denominator\u2014the 1,000 largest US retirement\nfunds grew 7 percent in the year ending September 2023, after falling 14 percent\nthe prior year, for example1\u2014many LPs remain overexposed to private markets\nrelative to their target allocations. LPs started 2023 overweight: according to\nanalysis from CEM Benchmarking, average allocations across PE, infrastructure,\nand real estate were at or above target allocations as of the beginning of the\nyear. And the numerator grew throughout the year, as a lack of exits and\nrebounding valuations drove net asset values (NAVs) higher. While not all LPs\nstrictly follow asset allocation targets, our analysis in partnership with\nglobal private markets firm StepStone Group suggests that an overallocation of\njust one percentage point can reduce planned commitments by as much as 10 to 12\npercent per year for five years or more.\n\nDespite these headwinds, recent surveys indicate that LPs remain broadly\ncommitted to private markets. In fact, the majority plan to maintain or increase\nallocations over the medium to long term.\n\n\nINVESTORS FLED TO KNOWN NAMES AND LARGER FUNDS\n\nFundraising concentration reached its highest level in over a decade, as\ninvestors continued to shift new commitments in favor of the largest fund\nmanagers. The 25 most successful fundraisers collected 41 percent of aggregate\ncommitments to closed-end funds (with the top five managers accounting for\nnearly half that total). Closed-end fundraising totals may understate the extent\nof concentration in the industry overall, as the largest managers also tend to\nbe more successful in raising non-institutional capital.\n\nWhile the largest funds grew even larger\u2014the largest vehicles on record were\nraised in buyout, real estate, infrastructure, and private debt in 2023\u2014smaller\nand newer funds struggled. Fewer than 1,700 funds of less than $1 billion were\nclosed during the year, half as many as closed in 2022 and the fewest of any\nyear since 2012. New manager formation also fell to the lowest level since 2012,\nwith just 651 new firms launched in 2023.\n\nWhether recent fundraising concentration and a spate of M&A activity signals the\nbeginning of oft-rumored consolidation in the private markets remains uncertain,\nas a similar pattern developed in each of the last two fundraising downturns\nbefore giving way to renewed entrepreneurialism among general partners (GPs) and\ncommitment diversification among LPs. Compared with how things played out in the\nlast two downturns, perhaps this movie really is different, or perhaps we\u2019re\nwatching a trilogy reusing a familiar plotline.\n\n\nDRY POWDER INVENTORY SPIKED (AGAIN)\n\nPrivate markets assets under management totaled $13.1 trillion as of June 30,\n2023, and have grown nearly 20 percent per annum since 2018. Dry powder\nreserves\u2014the amount of capital committed but not yet deployed\u2014increased to $3.7\ntrillion, marking the ninth consecutive year of growth. Dry powder inventory\u2014the\namount of capital available to GPs expressed as a multiple of annual\ndeployment\u2014increased for the second consecutive year in PE, as new commitments\ncontinued to outpace deal activity. Inventory sat at 1.6 years in 2023, up\nmarkedly from the 0.9 years recorded at the end of 2021 but still within the\nhistorical range. NAV grew as well, largely driven by the reluctance of managers\nto exit positions and crystallize returns in a depressed multiple environment.\n\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY STRATEGIES DIVERGED\n\nBuyout and venture capital, the two largest PE sub-asset classes, charted wildly\ndifferent courses over the past 18 months. Buyout notched its highest\nfundraising year ever in 2023, and its performance improved, with funds posting\na (still paltry) 5 percent net internal rate of return through September 30. And\nalthough buyout deal volumes declined by 19 percent, 2023 was still the\nthird-most-active year on record. In contrast, venture capital (VC) fundraising\ndeclined by nearly 60 percent, equaling its lowest total since 2015, and deal\nvolume fell by 36 percent to the lowest level since 2019. VC funds returned \u20133\npercent through September, posting negative returns for seven consecutive\nquarters. VC was the fastest-growing\u2014as well as the highest-performing\u2014PE\nstrategy by a significant margin from 2010 to 2022, but investors appear to be\nreevaluating their approach in the current environment.\n\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY ENTRY MULTIPLES CONTRACTED\n\nPE buyout entry multiples declined by roughly one turn from 11.9 to 11.0 times\nEBITDA, slightly outpacing the decline in public market multiples (down from\n12.1 to 11.3 times EBITDA), through the first nine months of 2023. For nearly a\ndecade leading up to 2022, managers consistently sold assets into a\nhigher-multiple environment than that in which they had bought those assets,\nproviding a substantial performance tailwind for the industry. Nowhere has this\nbeen truer than in technology. After experiencing more than eight turns of\nmultiple expansion from 2009 to 2021 (the most of any sector), technology\nmultiples have declined by nearly three turns in the past two years, 50 percent\nmore than in any other sector. Overall, roughly two-thirds of the total return\nfor buyout deals that were entered in 2010 or later and exited in 2021 or before\ncan be attributed to market multiple expansion and leverage. Now, with falling\nmultiples and higher financing costs, revenue growth and margin expansion are\ntaking center stage for GPs.\n\n\nREAL ESTATE RECEDED\n\nDemand uncertainty, slowing rent growth, and elevated financing costs drove cap\nrates higher and made price discovery challenging, all of which weighed on deal\nvolume, fundraising, and investment performance. Global closed-end fundraising\ndeclined 34 percent year over year, and funds returned \u22124 percent in the first\nnine months of the year, losing money for the first time since the 2007\u201308\nglobal financial crisis. Capital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies\nas investors sought liquidity via redemptions in open-end vehicles, from which\nnet outflows reached their highest level in at least two decades. Opportunistic\nstrategies benefited from this shift, with investors focusing on capital\nappreciation over income generation in a market where alternative sources of\nyield have grown more attractive. Rising interest rates widened bid\u2013ask spreads\nand impaired deal volume across food groups, including in what were formerly hot\nsectors: multifamily and industrial.\n\n\nPRIVATE DEBT PAYS DIVIDENDS\n\nDebt again proved to be the most resilient private asset class against a\nturbulent market backdrop. Fundraising declined just 13 percent, largely driven\nby lower commitments to direct lending strategies, for which a slower PE deal\nenvironment has made capital deployment challenging. The asset class also posted\nthe highest returns among all private asset classes through September 30. Many\nprivate debt securities are tied to floating rates, which enhance returns in a\nrising-rate environment. Thus far, managers appear to have successfully\nnavigated the rising incidence of default and distress exhibited across the\nbroader leveraged-lending market. Although direct lending deal volume declined\nfrom 2022, private lenders financed an all-time high 59 percent of leveraged\nbuyout transactions last year and are now expanding into additional strategies\nto drive the next era of growth.\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE TOOK A DETOUR\n\nAfter several years of robust growth and strong performance, infrastructure and\nnatural resources fundraising declined by 53 percent to the lowest total since\n2013. Supply-side timing is partially to blame: five of the seven largest\ninfrastructure managers closed a flagship vehicle in 2021 or 2022, and none of\nthose five held a final close last year. As in real estate, investors shied away\nfrom core and core-plus investments in a higher-yield environment. Yet there are\nreasons to believe infrastructure\u2019s growth will bounce back. Limited partners\n(LPs) surveyed by McKinsey remain bullish on their deployment to the asset\nclass, and at least a dozen vehicles targeting more than $10 billion were\nactively fundraising as of the end of 2023. Multiple recent acquisitions of\nlarge infrastructure GPs by global multi-asset-class managers also indicate\nmarketwide conviction in the asset class\u2019s potential.\n\n\nPRIVATE MARKETS STILL HAVE WORK TO DO ON DIVERSITY\n\nPrivate markets firms are slowly improving their representation of females (up\ntwo percentage points over the prior year) and ethnic and racial minorities (up\none percentage point). On some diversity metrics, including entry-level\nrepresentation of women, private markets now compare favorably with corporate\nAmerica. Yet broad-based parity remains elusive and too slow in the making.\nEthnic, racial, and gender imbalances are particularly stark across more\ninfluential investing roles and senior positions. In fact, McKinsey\u2019s\nresearch\u00a0reveals that at the current pace, it would take several decades for\nprivate markets firms to reach gender parity at senior levels. Increasing\nrepresentation across all levels will require managers to take fresh approaches\nto hiring, retention, and promotion.\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GENERATING EXCITEMENT\n\nThe transformative potential of generative AI was perhaps 2023\u2019s hottest topic\n(beyond Taylor Swift). Private markets players are excited about the potential\nfor the technology to optimize their approach to thesis generation, deal\nsourcing, investment due diligence, and portfolio performance, among other\nareas. While the technology is still nascent and few GPs can boast scaled\nimplementations, pilot programs are already in flight across the industry,\nparticularly within portfolio companies. Adoption seems nearly certain to\naccelerate throughout 2024.\n\nIf private markets investors entered 2023 hoping for a return to the heady days\nof 2021, they likely left the year disappointed. Many of the headwinds that\nemerged in the latter half of 2022 persisted throughout the year, pressuring\nfundraising, dealmaking, and performance. Inflation moderated somewhat over the\ncourse of the year but remained stubbornly elevated by recent historical\nstandards. Interest rates started high and rose higher, increasing the cost of\nfinancing. A reinvigorated public equity market recovered most of 2022\u2019s losses\nbut did little to resolve the valuation uncertainty private market investors\nhave faced for the past 18 months.\n\nWithin private markets, the denominator effect remained in play, despite the\npublic market recovery, as the numerator continued to expand. An\nactivity-dampening cycle emerged: higher cost of capital and lower multiples\nlimited the ability or willingness of general partners (GPs) to exit positions;\nfewer exits, coupled with continuing capital calls, pushed LP allocations\nhigher, thereby limiting their ability or willingness to make new commitments.\nThese conditions weighed on managers\u2019 ability to fundraise. Based on data\nreported as of year-end 2023, private markets fundraising fell 22 percent from\nthe prior year to just over $1 trillion, the largest such drop since 2009\n(Exhibit 1).\n\nThe impact of the fundraising environment was not felt equally among GPs.\nContinuing a trend that emerged in 2022, and consistent with prior downturns in\nfundraising, LPs favored larger vehicles and the scaled GPs that typically\nmanage them. Smaller and newer managers struggled, and the number of sub\u2013$1\nbillion vehicles and new firm launches each declined to its lowest level in more\nthan a decade.\n\nDespite the decline in fundraising, private markets assets under management\n(AUM) continued to grow, increasing 12 percent to $13.1 trillion as of June 30,\n2023. 2023 fundraising was still the sixth-highest annual haul on record,\npushing dry powder higher, while the slowdown in deal making limited\ndistributions.\n\nInvestment performance across private market asset classes fell short of\nhistorical averages. Private equity (PE) got back in the black but generated the\nlowest annual performance in the past 15 years, excluding 2022. Closed-end real\nestate produced negative returns for the first time since 2009, as\ncapitalization (cap) rates expanded across sectors and rent growth dissipated in\nformerly hot sectors, including multifamily and industrial. The performance of\ninfrastructure funds was less than half of its long-term average and even\nfurther below the double-digit returns generated in 2021 and 2022. Private debt\nwas the standout performer (if there was one), outperforming all other private\nasset classes and illustrating the asset class\u2019s countercyclical appeal.\n\n\n\nHigher financing costs, lower multiples, and an uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment created a challenging backdrop for private equity managers in 2023.\nFundraising declined for the second year in a row, falling 15 percent to $649\nbillion, as LPs grappled with the denominator effect and a slowdown in\ndistributions. Managers were on the fundraising trail longer to raise this\ncapital: funds that closed in 2023 were open for a record-high average of 20.1\nmonths, notably longer than 18.7 months in 2022 and 14.1 months in 2018. VC and\ngrowth equity strategies led the decline, dropping to their lowest level of\ncumulative capital raised since 2015. Fundraising in Asia fell for the fourth\nyear of the last five, with the greatest decline in China.\n\nDespite the difficult fundraising context, a subset of strategies and managers\nprevailed. Buyout managers collectively had their best fundraising year on\nrecord, raising more than $400 billion. Fundraising in Europe surged by more\nthan 50 percent, resulting in the region\u2019s biggest haul ever. The largest\nmanagers raised an outsized share of the total for a second consecutive year,\nmaking 2023 the most concentrated fundraising year of the last decade (Exhibit\n2).\n\nDespite the drop in aggregate fundraising, PE assets under management increased\n8 percent to $8.2 trillion. Only a small part of this growth was performance\ndriven: PE funds produced a net IRR of just 2.5 percent through September 30,\n2023. Buyouts and growth equity generated positive returns, while VC lost money.\nPE performance, dating back to the beginning of 2022, remains negative,\nhighlighting the difficulty of generating attractive investment returns in a\nhigher interest rate and lower multiple environment. As PE managers devise value\ncreation strategies to improve performance, their focus includes ensuring\noperating efficiency and profitability of their portfolio companies.\n\nDeal activity volume and count fell sharply, by 21 percent and 24 percent,\nrespectively, which continued the slower pace set in the second half of 2022.\nSponsors largely opted to hold assets longer rather than lock in underwhelming\nreturns. While higher financing costs and valuation mismatches weighed on\noverall deal activity, certain types of M&A gained share. Add-on deals, for\nexample, accounted for a record 46 percent of total buyout deal volume last\nyear.\n\n\n\nFor real estate, 2023 was a year of transition, characterized by a litany of new\nand familiar challenges. Pandemic-driven demand issues continued, while elevated\nfinancing costs, expanding cap rates, and valuation uncertainty weighed on\ncommercial real estate deal volumes, fundraising, and investment performance.\n\nManagers faced one of the toughest fundraising environments in many years.\nGlobal closed-end fundraising declined 34 percent to $125 billion. While\nfundraising challenges were widespread, they were not ubiquitous across\nstrategies. Dollars continued to shift to large, multi-asset class platforms,\nwith the top five managers accounting for 37 percent of aggregate closed-end\nreal estate fundraising. In April, the largest real estate fund ever raised\nclosed on a record $30 billion.\n\nCapital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies as investors sought\nliquidity through redemptions in open-end vehicles and reduced gross\ncontributions to the lowest level since 2009. Opportunistic strategies benefited\nfrom this shift, as investors turned their attention toward capital appreciation\nover income generation in a market where alternative sources of yield have grown\nmore attractive.\n\nIn the United States, for instance, open-end funds, as represented by the\nNational Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Fund Index\u2014Open-End\nEquity (NFI-OE), recorded $13 billion in net outflows in 2023, reversing the\ntrend of positive net inflows throughout the 2010s. The negative flows mainly\nreflected $9 billion in core outflows, with core-plus funds accounting for the\nremaining outflows, which reversed a 20-year run of net inflows.\n\nAs a result, the NAV in US open-end funds fell roughly 16 percent year over\nyear. Meanwhile, global assets under management in closed-end funds reached a\nnew peak of $1.7 trillion as of June 2023, growing 14 percent between June 2022\nand June 2023.\n\nReal estate underperformed historical averages in 2023, as previously\nhigh-performing multifamily and industrial sectors joined office in producing\nnegative returns caused by slowing demand growth and cap rate expansion.\nClosed-end funds generated a pooled net IRR of \u22123.5 percent in the first nine\nmonths of 2023, losing money for the first time since the global financial\ncrisis. The lone bright spot among major sectors was hospitality, which\u2014thanks\nto a rush of postpandemic travel\u2014returned 10.3 percent in 2023.2 As a whole, the\naverage pooled lifetime net IRRs for closed-end real estate funds from 2011\u201320\nvintages remained around historical levels (9.8 percent).\n\nGlobal deal volume declined 47 percent in 2023 to reach a ten-year low of $650\nbillion, driven by widening bid\u2013ask spreads amid valuation uncertainty and\nhigher costs of financing (Exhibit 3).3 Deal flow in the office sector remained\ndepressed, partly as a result of continued uncertainty in the demand for space\nin a hybrid working world.\n\n\n\nDuring a turbulent year for private markets, private debt was a relative bright\nspot, topping private markets asset classes in terms of fundraising growth, AUM\ngrowth, and performance.\n\nFundraising for private debt declined just 13 percent year over year, nearly ten\npercentage points less than the private markets overall. Despite the decline in\nfundraising, AUM surged 27 percent to $1.7 trillion. And private debt posted the\nhighest investment returns of any private asset class through the first three\nquarters of 2023.\n\nPrivate debt\u2019s risk/return characteristics are well suited to the current\nenvironment. With interest rates at their highest in more than a decade, current\nyields in the asset class have grown more attractive on both an absolute and\nrelative basis, particularly if higher rates sustain and put downward pressure\non equity returns (Exhibit 4). The built-in security derived from debt\u2019s\nprivileged position in the capital structure, moreover, appeals to investors\nthat are wary of market volatility and valuation uncertainty.\n\nDirect lending continued to be the largest strategy in 2023, with fundraising\nfor the mostly-senior-debt strategy accounting for almost half of the asset\nclass\u2019s total haul (despite declining from the previous year). Separately,\nmezzanine debt fundraising hit a new high, thanks to the closings of three of\nthe largest funds ever raised in the strategy.\n\nOver the longer term, growth in private debt has largely been driven by\ninstitutional investors rotating out of traditional fixed income in favor of\nprivate alternatives. Despite this growth in commitments, LPs remain underweight\nin this asset class relative to their targets. In fact, the allocation gap has\nonly grown wider in recent years, a sharp contrast to other private asset\nclasses, for which LPs\u2019 current allocations exceed their targets on average.\nAccording to data from CEM Benchmarking, the private debt allocation gap now\nstands at 1.4 percent, which means that, in aggregate, investors must commit\nhundreds of billions in net new capital to the asset class just to reach current\ntargets.\n\nPrivate debt was not completely immune to the macroeconomic conditions last\nyear, however. Fundraising declined for the second consecutive year and now sits\n23 percent below 2021\u2019s peak. Furthermore, though private lenders took share in\n2023 from other capital sources, overall deal volumes also declined for the\nsecond year in a row. The drop was largely driven by a less active PE deal\nenvironment: private debt is predominantly used to finance PE-backed companies,\nthough managers are increasingly diversifying their origination capabilities to\ninclude a broad new range of companies and asset types.\n\n\n\nFor infrastructure and natural resources fundraising, 2023 was an exceptionally\nchallenging year. Aggregate capital raised declined 53 percent year over year to\n$82 billion, the lowest annual total since 2013. The size of the drop is\nparticularly surprising in light of infrastructure\u2019s recent momentum. The asset\nclass had set fundraising records in four of the previous five years, and\ninfrastructure is often considered an attractive investment in uncertain\nmarkets.\n\nWhile there is little doubt that the broader fundraising headwinds discussed\nelsewhere in this report affected infrastructure and natural resources\nfundraising last year, dynamics specific to the asset class were at play as\nwell. One issue was supply-side timing: nine of the ten largest infrastructure\nGPs did not close a flagship fund in 2023. Second was the migration of investor\ndollars away from core and core-plus investments, which have historically\naccounted for the bulk of infrastructure fundraising, in a higher rate\nenvironment.\n\nThe asset class had some notable bright spots last year. Fundraising for\nhigher-returning opportunistic strategies more than doubled the prior year\u2019s\ntotal (Exhibit 5). AUM grew 18 percent, reaching a new high of $1.5 trillion.\nInfrastructure funds returned a net IRR of 3.4 percent in 2023; this was below\nhistorical averages but still the second-best return among private asset\nclasses. And as was the case in other asset classes, investors concentrated\ncommitments in larger funds and managers in 2023, including in the largest\ninfrastructure fund ever raised.\n\nThe outlook for the asset class, moreover, remains positive. Funds targeting a\nrecord amount of capital were in the market at year-end, providing a robust\nfoundation for fundraising in 2024 and 2025. A recent spate of infrastructure GP\nacquisitions signal multi-asset managers\u2019 long-term conviction in the asset\nclass, despite short-term headwinds. Global megatrends like decarbonization and\ndigitization, as well as revolutions in energy and mobility, have spurred new\ninfrastructure investment opportunities around the world, particularly for\nvalue-oriented investors that are willing to take on more risk.\n\n\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become an important part of the\nfundraising, talent, and investing landscape for private market participants.\nEncouragingly, incremental progress has been made in recent years, including\nmore diverse talent being brought to entry-level positions, investing roles, and\ninvestment committees. The scope of DEI metrics provided to institutional\ninvestors during fundraising has also increased in recent years: more than half\nof PE firms now provide data across investing teams, portfolio company boards,\nand portfolio company management (versus investment team data only).4\n\nIn 2023, McKinsey surveyed 66 global private markets firms that collectively\nemploy more than 60,000 people for the second annual State of diversity in\nglobal private markets report.5 The research offers insight into the\nrepresentation of women and ethnic and racial minorities in private investing as\nof year-end 2022. In this chapter, we discuss where the numbers stand and how\nfirms can bring a more diverse set of perspectives to the table.\n\nThe statistics indicate signs of modest advancement. Overall representation of\nwomen in private markets increased two percentage points to 35 percent, and\nethnic and racial minorities increased one percentage point to 30 percent\n(Exhibit 6). Entry-level positions have nearly reached gender parity, with\nfemale representation at 48 percent. The share of women holding C-suite roles\nglobally increased 3 percentage points, while the share of people from ethnic\nand racial minorities in investment committees increased 9 percentage points.\nThere is growing evidence that external hiring is gradually helping close the\ndiversity gap, especially at senior levels. For example, 33 percent of external\nhires at the managing director level were ethnic or racial minorities, higher\nthan their existing representation level (19 percent).\n\nYet, the scope of the challenge remains substantial. Women and minorities\ncontinue to be underrepresented in senior positions and investing roles. They\nalso experience uneven rates of progress due to lower promotion and higher\nattrition rates, particularly at smaller firms. Firms are also navigating an\nincreasingly polarized workplace today, with additional scrutiny and a growing\nnumber of lawsuits against corporate diversity and inclusion programs,\nparticularly in the US, which threatens to impact the industry\u2019s pace of\nprogress.\n\n\n\nFredrik Dahlqvist is a senior partner in McKinsey\u2019s Stockholm office; Alastair\nGreen\u00a0is a senior partner in the Washington, DC, office, where Paul Maia and\nAlexandra Nee\u00a0are partners; David Quigley\u00a0is a senior partner in the New York\noffice, where Connor Mangan is an associate partner and Aditya Sanghvi\u00a0is a\nsenior partner; Rahel Schneider is an associate partner in the Bay Area office;\nJohn Spivey is a partner in the Charlotte office; and Brian Vickery\u00a0is a partner\nin the Boston office.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Jonathan Christy, Louis Dufau, Vaibhav Gujral, Graham\nHealy-Day, Laura Johnson, Ryan Luby, Tripp Norton, Alastair Rami, Henri Torbey,\nand Alex Wolkomir for their contributions\n\nThe authors would also like to thank CEM Benchmarking and the StepStone Group\nfor their partnership in this year's report.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis article was edited by Arshiya Khullar, an editor in the Gurugram office.\n\nEXPLORE A CAREER WITH US",

        "content": "A view of the NEV production line of BYD in Rayong, Thailand.\u00a0SUN WEITONG/XINHUA\n\nAt Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor's welding workshop in Rayong, Thailand,\nnumerous robotic arms in operation indicate the level of high-tech in use even\nas Chinese technicians guide local employees through the welding process.\n\nFollowing the successful rollout of its first electric vehicle at its plant in\nThailand this January, the Baoding, Hebei province-based carmaker said that\nmultiple batches of Thai workers have now mastered the production processes of\nits EV products. They have thus become valuable assets for the company, aiding\nits expansion efforts in other Southeast Asian markets.\n\nElsewhere, Beijing-based artificial intelligence services provider Terminus\nGroup is charting a similar course to bring additional value to an overseas\nmarket. Amid the intensified efforts by many Middle Eastern countries to\nleverage the digital economy for sustainable growth, Terminus launched its\ninternational headquarters in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, in February.\n\nIt will not only facilitate Terminus' projects and business expansion\ninitiatives in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and other countries in the\nregion, but also support the group's operations in Singapore, Australia and\nnumerous countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBoth GWM and Terminus are epitomes of a larger trend \u2014 that of Chinese\nenterprises operating in the vast BRI landscape going beyond big-ticket\ninfrastructure projects like dams, highways, railroads, airports and municipal\nengineering works.\n\nAs many parts of the world enter a new phase of development, Chinese companies,\nparticularly those from high-end manufacturing and trade in services, are\nadjusting their strategies to better align with the evolving environment in BRI\neconomies, said Wan Zhe, a researcher at the Belt and Road School of Beijing\nNormal University.\n\nFacing challenges like escalating geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism\nin certain countries, Chinese enterprises are focusing on avoiding risks and\ngenerating revenue through higher-value business ventures that serve the\nchanging landscape better, said Wan.\n\nFor instance, GWM plans to start operations at its new factories in Vietnam,\nIndonesia and Malaysia this year or the next.\n\nSimilarly, Chang'an Automobile Co, a Chongqing-based State-owned automaker, is\nbuilding a factory in Rayong province, Thailand. The first phase of the project\nwill involve an investment of over $240 million and is scheduled to begin\nproduction in 2025.\n\nEmployees work on a battery production line of BYD in Brazil.\u00a0WANG\nTIANCONG/XINHUA\n\nThe new energy vehicles produced will be not only marketed in Thailand but also\nexported to other neighboring ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)\ncountries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and South\nAfrica, said Shen Xinghua, president of Chang'an Automobile's business for\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nShen said that the initial annual production capacity of this plant is 100,000\nunits, which will be gradually expanded to 200,000 units in the next phase.\n\nChen Bin, deputy director of an expert committee at the Beijing-based China\nMachinery Industry Federation, said that South Africa, Hungary, Saudi Arabia,\nIndonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia have all formulated EV-related policies to\nencourage and support the development and growth of the industry.\n\nHighlighting that electrification and intelligence complement each other, Chen\nsaid with growing populations in many countries, particularly in Africa and\nSoutheast Asia, an increasing number of young consumers who prefer smart\ntechnologies are emerging, making these markets more proactive in embracing EVs.\n\nHis observation reflects a trend. China's NEVs are becoming popular in overseas\nmarkets thanks to their quality, driving range and multifunctionality.\n\nSome 519,000 EVs and plug-in hybrids were exported from China between January\nand May, up 13.7 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile\nManufacturers.\n\nChina's continuous efforts to enhance institutional opening-up and secure\nhigh-standard economic and free trade agreements, alongside the swift expansion\nof its tech-intensive green product industries, are anticipated to propel its\ncompanies to strategically invest in new plants, service centers and innovation\nfacilities in markets involved in the BRI, said Yu Jianlong, vice-chairman of\nthe Beijing-headquartered China Council for the Promotion of International\nTrade.\n\nIn addition to automakers such as SAIC Motor, Beijing Automotive Group,\nGuangzhou Automobile Group and BYD, Chinese battery and component manufacturers,\nincluding Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, Gotion High-tech Co Ltd and\nEVE Energy Co Ltd, have invested in BRI economies to supply products to their\ndomestic partners and create jobs for local communities.\n\nRecognizing this trend, Matthias Loebich, partner and leader for international\nbusiness at Bearing-Point, a European management and technology consultancy with\nmore than 10,000 employees across 70 countries and regions, said that China's\nfast-growing EV sector will continue to lead the world's green transition and\ncreate enormous growth opportunities for upstream and downstream industries in\nthe BRI landscape.\n\n\"This is evident in our doubling of Chinese automotive clients seeking\nconsulting support over the past two years,\" said Loebich, noting that Chinese\nautomakers are enhancing their internal capabilities in management, digital\ntransformation and overseas strategies, learning from advanced markets to\nelevate their global presence.\n\nThe company established a dedicated team to help Chinese automakers conduct\nsustainability-related activities in both home and global markets in 2023, in\norder to further enhance their growth strength.\n\nCollectively, such moves have had a positive effect on official data. China's\nnonfinancial outbound direct investment came in at $60.2 billion in the first\nfive months, up 16.3 percent year-on-year, statistics from the Ministry of\nCommerce showed.\n\nChina's cooperation with countries and regions participating in the BRI\ncontinued to show growth momentum as ODI in these economies came in at $12.81\nbillion, up nearly 13 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe value of trade between China and BRI economies was worth 8.31 trillion yuan\n($1.14 trillion) during the January-May period, up 7.2 percent year-on-year,\ndata from the General Administration of Customs showed.\n\nSuch a rise will likely be sustained given certain strategic Chinese corporate\nmoves. For instance, in late June, Chinese train maker CRRC Corp, driven by its\nproduct upgrade and technology accumulation, unveiled seven new energy\nlocomotives in Beijing, to offer the world new solutions for green, low-carbon\ndevelopment in rail transport. These will enrich CRRC Corp's overall product\nofferings. This marked a notable step forward in green transition efforts in\nboth domestic and global markets.\n\nLin Cunzeng, CRRC's vice-president, said the development of this series of new\nenergy locomotives is a concrete step to promote the renewal and upgrade of\noutdated equipment in both home and foreign markets, and advance the green and\nlow-carbon transformation of rail transit equipment.\n\n\"They will contribute to the high-quality growth of the BRI and enrich China's\nexport content,\" said Lin.\n\nThese new locomotives, he said, will drive the demand for diverse new energy\nproducts like power batteries and hydrogen energy power packs. They will,\ntherefore, stimulate the development of upstream industries like basic materials\nand core components, fostering new drivers of economic growth.\n\nThe current reshaping of the global supply chain has generated new avenues for\nChinese companies to match their capabilities with shifting market needs, said\nLyu Yue, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies, part of the\nUniversity of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"Showing strong competitiveness, Chinese companies excel in industries like new\nenergy vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic products,\" said Lyu,\nadding this has resulted in increased acceptance and collaboration from many\ncountries involved in the BRI.\n\nAgreed Michael Dyke, CEO of the Riyadh-based New Murabba Development Co, a\nbusiness unit of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Dyke said that the\ntangible growth of the BRI and enhanced Sino-Saudi business relations will\nattract more Chinese companies to expand their market presence in Saudi Arabia.\n\nNew Murabba Development is responsible for building a modern town in Riyadh. Its\ndevelopment spans 19 square kilometers. The project will include 2 million\nsquare meters of floor space featuring retail areas, tourist attractions,\n104,000 residential units, 9,000 hotel rooms and 80 entertainment venues. Its\nfirst phase is scheduled to be completed and operationalized in 2030.\n\nChina Harbour Engineering Co Ltd, a Beijing-headquartered subsidiary of\nState-owned China Communications Construction Co Ltd, will carry out the first\nphase of excavation work for this project.",

        "content": "5 min (1403 words) Read\n\nDownload PDF\n\nProtectionism could make the world less resilient, more unequal, and more\nconflict-prone\n\nFour years ago, one of us wrote an article on the future of trade for the June\n2019 issue of this magazine, celebrating the 75th anniversary of Bretton Woods.\nThe message was that there was no strong evidence of a retreat from\nglobalization, but international trade and the multilateral system that\nunderpinned it were under attack, and their future would depend on policy\nchoices. Since then, policymakers in some of the world\u2019s largest economies have\nmade choices to halt further international integration and, in several\ninstances, to embrace protectionist or nationalist policies.\n\nToday, there is still no conclusive evidence that international trade is\ndeglobalizing. When measured in US dollars, global trade growth slowed after the\nglobal financial crisis in 2008\u201309 and declined sharply at the onset of the\npandemic in 2020. But since then trade has rebounded to the highest value ever.\nAs a share of GDP, global trade has fallen modestly, driven mostly by\nChina\u2014which for years has pursued a \u201cdual circulation\u201d strategy of prioritizing\ndomestic consumption while remaining open to international trade and\ninvestment\u2014and India (see chart 1). This reflects the end of an extraordinary\nexport boom both countries experienced in previous decades as well as fewer\nimports of intermediate goods than in the past. Yet, as a share of GDP, imports\nof intermediates by the rest of the world are still growing (see chart 2). The\nsame is true of exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican and Chinese tariffs introduced in 2018 did not reduce trade. They\ncurbed trade between the US and China, as expected. But trade in the products\nmost affected by tariffs grew among the rest of the world. In other words, trade\nwas merely reallocated, not reduced. And the tariff war did not stop other\ncountries\u2014such as members of the African Union, the Association of Southeast\nAsian Nations, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific\nPartnership\u2014from pursuing regional or plurilateral trade agreements.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to temporarily restrict exports of\nmedicines, and some halted shipments of wheat and other foods as prices spiked\nfollowing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But many governments are still\naggressively pursuing economic integration, for instance through deals that make\nit easier for professionals to work in foreign countries or that facilitate the\nflow of consumer goods through common safety standards.\n\nTrade may, of course, respond with a delay to changes in the policy environment.\nAnd policy itself may lag changes in public sentiment. Terms such as \u201cnational\nsecurity\u201d and \u201creshoring\u201d have shown up more frequently in news articles and\nresearch papers. Perhaps most telling are recent polls of economists by the\nUniversity of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. In March 2018, 100 percent of\nthose surveyed were against the initial US tariffs. Yet in January 2022,\nrespondents were skeptical about global supply chains: only 2 out of 44\neconomists disagreed with the statement that reliance on foreign inputs had made\nAmerican industries vulnerable to disruptions.\n\nHYPERGLOBALIZATION\n\nThe era of \u201chyperglobalization\u201d that took shape from the 1990s onward was\nassociated with great economic achievement. Extreme poverty as defined by the\nWorld Bank was dramatically reduced and expected to be eliminated in all but a\nsmall number of institutionally fragile countries, partly thanks to dramatic\ngrowth in East Asian countries. Standards of living, as measured by income per\ncapita, increased across the world.\n\nConsumers in economies open to trade gained access to an extraordinary variety\nof goods sourced from all over the planet at affordable prices. Smartphones,\ncomputers, and other electronics allowed people to be more productive and to\nenjoy more varied entertainment than previous generations had ever dreamed.\nDeclining prices of air travel allowed people to visit other countries, exposing\nthem to new cultures and ideas\u2014an experience once reserved for the\nultrawealthy.\u00a0\n\nWhile many factors contributed to this rise in living standards, openness and\nother market-oriented policies\u00a0played an essential role. Trade with (at the\ntime) low-wage countries influenced goods prices and wages in advanced\neconomies, benefiting consumers in these countries and workers in exporting\neconomies. Inflation remained surprisingly low\u2014despite quantitative easing and\nincreasing debt in the US.\n\nFinally, the Western world enjoyed a historically rare long period of peace that\nfostered prosperity. The tight global interconnectedness achieved by the end of\nthe 20th century was arguably a major contributing factor by giving everyone an\nincentive to behave. War in this hyperglobalized era meant disruption of global\nsupply chains, with potentially dire consequences for the world economy\u2014as we\nare in the process of finding out.\n\nYet beneath the surface, tensions were building that led to a backlash against\nglobalization. We chart three phases of this deglobalization movement. The first\nphase began around 2015 as anxiety about globalization and competition from\nlow-wage countries gave rise to Brexit, US tariffs, China\u2019s retaliation, and a\nresurgence of extremist views in Europe.\n\nGLOBAL BACKLASH\n\nWhile the average person in the world was better off at the end of the 2010s,\nmany workers in advanced economies were\u00a0feeling left behind, doing worse than\ntheir parents. There is substantial economic research documenting these\ndistributional effects, which had a distinct geographic component: communities\nmore exposed to import competition from low-wage countries thanks to preexisting\nspatial industrialization patterns did worse than communities that were\nsheltered from imports.\n\nThis, in turn, had important political consequences in the US and the UK. At the\nsame time, globalization created big winners: multinational \u201csuperstar\u201d firms\nthat benefited from the hyperspecialization of global value chains, in the form\nof lower costs and higher profits, as well as a class of highly compensated\nindividuals who reaped the rewards associated with expanding markets and new\neconomic opportunities. Not only were some left behind; others were racing\nahead.\n\nThere has been a clear change in policy and public attitude toward global trade.\nHow did we get here? What role have different factors played? And what could\ncome next?\n\nIt took time for mainstream economists to acknowledge these effects. But in many\nways the effects were nothing new: they reflected the usual tension between\noverall welfare and distributional conflict generated by trade. However, the\nspeed and intensity of these changes gave this tension a new dimension.\nSimilarly, there was nothing fundamentally new about economists\u2019\nrecommendations: most rejected protectionism as a solution and endorsed some\nform of redistribution from winners to losers.\n\nAt the same time, Western governments were becoming increasingly concerned that\ncompetition with China was \u201cunfair,\u201d given its use of subsidies as well as\nrestrictions imposed on companies seeking access to its market. This spurred\ndemands for more confrontational policies toward China, especially because it\nwas no longer a poor developing economy.\n\nOf course, there had been backlash against global trade before, notably at the\n1999 Seattle protests. But these movements did not influence policy. There was\nlittle reason to believe that the backlash against globalization between 2015\nand 2018 would have permanent consequences for the future of globalization\neither. After all, the world was too interconnected to revert to the old regime.\n\nPANDEMIC PRESSURES\n\nThe second phase of the deglobalization movement began with calls for resilience\nat the onset of the pandemic in 2020. But what is resilience? There is no clear\nbenchmark. Defining and measuring resilience depend on the nature of the shock.\nCOVID, for example, was both a supply shock\u2014with key international suppliers\nfacing lockdowns at different times, slowing deliveries\u2014and a demand shock, as\ndemand for medical goods and durable goods like cars and second homes grew\nrapidly.\n\nDuring COVID, short-term delivery delays and shortages due to the disruption of\ninternational trade were widely described as a crisis. But much of this was\nblown out of proportion, and in fact markets proved extremely resilient\n(Goldberg and Reed 2023a). The US, for instance, imports medical goods and\nsupplies from a diverse group of countries. The one exception is face masks. But\nin 2020 shipments of face masks from China arrived within months, and this meant\nthat shortages were completely alleviated.\n\nSuch examples show that international trade increased resilience. Along the same\nlines, the US actually preserved trade relationships; importers traded with\nforeign partners more regularly and sought out new suppliers, even though\noverall trade volume fell. Other papers show, based on quantitative model\nsimulations, that international trade makes economies more diversified and hence\nmore resilient (Caselli and others 2020; Bonadio and others 2021). The intuition\nis that supply shocks are less correlated across economies than within them and\nthat access to multiple suppliers makes it easier to respond to country-specific\nshocks.\n\nOverall, arguments against trade that emphasize the fragility of supply chains\nare not consistent with evidence. These arguments were used to stoke the\nprotectionist sentiment that had originated in the first phase, but ultimately\nthe initial effects were not enduring. Trade grew fast in 2021 as the world\nturned a corner in management of the pandemic.\n\nGEOPOLITICAL PRESSURES\n\nThe third phase began with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. For\nthe public, this highlighted new risks from international specialization. As\nRussia cut gas supplies to Europeans and energy prices skyrocketed, the pitfalls\nof reliance on a single country for imports of a critical input became clear.\nThe concerns were not intrinsically about Russia. But by extrapolation,\ncountries began to wonder what would happen if they had to decouple from China\novernight. Policymakers concluded, if they had not already, that it would be\nbetter to decouple immediately on their own terms.\n\nAround the same time, a new mindset was widely adopted\u2014namely, that\ninternational welfare is a zero-sum game. The United States imposed a ban on\nexports to China of advanced logic and memory chips and the machinery to produce\nthem. Semiconductor technologies certainly do have military applications, and\nthe export bans could set back China\u2019s military. But the technologies have many\nmore applications in the civilian sector, and so these bans also retard civilian\ntechnological development. The world shifted from one in which trade,\ncompetition, and innovation in all countries were encouraged to one in which the\nmost advanced economy sought not just to compete but to foreclose.\n\nAt this point any forecasts are highly speculative, since, as before, outcomes\nwill be highly dependent on policy choices. One possibility is that this is as\nfar as the deglobalization movement goes; interventions to foreclose technology\naccess will be limited to products with a credible dual use, while trade in\nother products will continue to flourish. But another possibility is that the\nworld will end up fragmented in rival camps and that a new cold war will unfold,\nthis time between the US and China (and their respective allies). The\nconsequences of the latter scenario could be severe.\n\nNEW COLD WAR\n\nMany models of long-term growth emphasize the role of population size in\nresearch and development. The world\u2019s largest and most populous economies are\nexpected to have new ideas and develop absolute advantages, as evidenced by\ntheir leading market positions in a variety of products. If scientific\ncollaboration between China and the US breaks down, the world could have fewer\nsolutions to the next pandemic and endemic diseases.\n\nMore generally, separating from \u201cnon-friendly\u201d partners means removing potential\nlow-cost suppliers. When it comes to decarbonization, for instance, the cost of\nsolar panels is substantially higher in the West than in China, and industry\nestimates suggest that tariffs have slowed installation. Addressing climate\nchange is urgent. Every year lost results in more damage and substantially\nlarger mitigation costs.\n\nIs this the price of greater resilience? Restricting global trade is unlikely to\nlead to resilience. As we argued earlier, resilience cannot be evaluated without\nreference to specific shocks. Trade exclusively with \u201cfriendly\u201d countries may\nimply greater resilience to geopolitical risks\u2014at least in the near term\u2014but the\nconcept of friendship is itself subject to constant change. It may, however,\nlead to less resilience to other types of shocks, such as the recent health\nshock.\n\nWithin countries, inequality could increase. Greater trade barriers lead to\nhigher prices, which mean lower real wages. Globalization may have contributed\nto more spatial inequality, but protectionism is not the cure: it will likely\nmake the problem worse. Across countries, there is a risk of increased global\ninequality. Geoeconomic fragmentation could lead to more trade between\nhigh-income economies that are \u201cfriends.\u201d Increasing emphasis on environmental\nand labor standards in trade agreements would raise entry barriers for very poor\ncountries that find it difficult to meet these requirements. Without access to\nlucrative foreign markets, there is no clear path for poverty reduction and\ndevelopment in such economies (Goldberg and Reed 2022).\n\nBut the greatest risk may be to peace. Cold wars have often led to hot wars.\nDuring the interwar period in the 1930s there was a dramatic shift away from\nmultilateral trade toward trade within empires or informal spheres of influence.\nHistorians have argued that this shift exacerbated tensions between countries\nahead of World War II. We can only hope that the coming years will not be a\nreplay of this pre-belligerence era.\n\nA more detailed discussion of this topic can be found in our paper published in\nthe March 2023 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (\u201cIs the Global Economy\nDeglobalizing?

        "content": "WHAT IS A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION?\n\nA multinational corporation (MNC) is a company that has business operations in\nat least one country other than its home country and generates revenue beyond\nits borders. Chances are the clothes you're wearing, the smartphone in your\npocket, and the transportation you take to work all have one thing in common:\nthey were likely manufactured by an MNC, as are 90% of American imports.\n\nMultinationals permeate nearly every aspect of our modern lives while wielding a\nstaggering influence politically and economically, with more than a quarter of\nAmerican workers employed by one. The first multinationals were colonial\nenterprises. The East India Company (formed 1600), Dutch East India Company\n(VOC; 1602), and the Hudson Bay Colony (HBC, 1649) stand out as central to\nimperialist histories whose rapaciousness still haunts anyone with even the\nvaguest sense of history. Remarkably, HBC endures, as does its core business\nmodel, sourcing clothing and other materials\u2014while holding massive amounts of\nreal estate\u2014in one part of the world to sell finished goods to Western\nconsumers.\n\nThe MNCs formed more recently have often not equipped themselves much better:\nJust 57 multinationals were responsible for unleashing 80% of global carbon\nemissions between 2016 and 2022. Yet, despite their ubiquity in what we wear and\neven the air we breathe, there is still widespread confusion about what defines\na company as \"multinational.\" Is it simply having offices or factories overseas?\nSelling products internationally? Or is there more to it?\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n * A multinational corporation (MNC) has business operations in at least two\n   countries, often with headquarters in one country and subsidiaries,\n   manufacturing plants, and offices in other nations.\n * MNCs have expanded rapidly in recent decades because of falling trade\n   barriers, the search for new markets, expanding global supply chains, and\n   outsourcing operations to lower-cost regions.\n * Multinational corporations can bring benefits like job creation,\n   infrastructure investment, and improved quality of goods in the countries\n   where they operate, but many are known for disreputable tax, environmental,\n   and labor practices.\n * Well-known examples of multinational corporations include Apple Inc. (AAPL),\n   Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), Nestle SA (NSRGY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM),\n   and Coca-Cola Co. (KO).\n\nMultinationals have fundamentally shaped the flow of capital, goods, and\nservices in a world that they helped connect, perhaps more than any military,\nduring the centuries-long process of globalization. Their incredible economic\nclout has also sparked heated debates around their power, labor practices,\nenvironmental impacts, and tax avoidance strategies. In this article, we take\nyou through their history, organizational structures, and complex role in\nglobalization.\n\nInvestopedia / Jessica Olah\n\n\nHOW A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION WORKS\n\nMNCs operate in at least two countries, with significant business activities and\ninvestments spanning across national borders. Their rise can be traced to the\n1600s and colonialism, though the modern corporation took shape with the\nemergence of large-scale industries such as oil, automobiles, and consumer goods\nin the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Companies like Standard Oil, Ford,\nand Coca-Cola were among the forerunners in expanding their operations globally\nwhile amassing revenues on par with entire nations.\n\nLater, the post-World War II era saw their accelerated growth, driven by trade\nliberalization, advances in shipping and other technologies, and the increasing\ninterconnectedness of global markets.\n\nVinci SA, the French multinational construction firm, had the most subsidiaries\nworldwide, at 2,689. In second place is HCA Healthcare, the U.S. pharmaceutical\nand healthcare giant, with 2,447.\n\nBut what are they? These companies take different forms, from giant\nconglomerates with diverse portfolios to specialized firms focusing on specific\nindustries or regions. Here are the main points about their structure:\n\n * Definition: MNCs are often formally defined as business entities with one or\n   more foreign affiliates in which the parent company holds at least a 10%\n   ownership stake. Most foreign affiliates are 100% owned by their parents.\n * Structure: MNCs typically consist of a parent company headquartered in one\n   country, with subsidiaries, branches, or joint ventures in multiple host\n   countries. The parent company maintains strategic control over its global\n   operations, setting overall goals, policies, and standards. Subsidiaries are\n   separate legal entities in the countries where they operate.\n * Governance: MNCs often have centralized management, with the most important\n   decisions made at the headquarters. However, some adopt a more decentralized\n   approach, giving regional or country-specific management teams greater\n   autonomy. MNCs may also have a matrix-like structure, where employees report\n   to both functional (e.g. marketing, finance) and geographic managers (e.g.\n   country or regional heads).\n\nThe foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of multinational corporations\nincreased by over 106 times between 1970 and 2023, from $13 billion to $1.37\ntrillion.\n\nThe specific organizational design of MNCs depends on where they are and their\nindustry. Though the two terms are often used interchangeably, multinational\nenterprises (MNEs) and MNCs are different. MNEs are entities that engage in\nforeign direct investment (FDI) and own or control production or material\ndevelopment firms in more than one country. This is a very broad definition for\na reason: MNEs include corporations, partnerships, state-run enterprises, and\nother types of business structures. MNEs can be private or state-owned and may\noperate in various sectors, such as manufacturing, services, or extractive\nindustries. MNCs are a specific type of MNE that takes the form of a\ncorporation. In sum, while all MNCs are MNEs, not all MNEs are MNCs.\n\nDeveloping an international presence can open up new markets where\nmultinationals can sell goods or produce the same quality of products at lower\ncosts. MNCs can thus reduce prices and increase the purchasing power of\nconsumers worldwide. They may also take advantage of lower tax rates in\ncountries eager for FDI, and critics point to their propensity for developing\nmonopolies where they operate. This can drive up prices, squelch competition,\nand inhibit innovation.\n\nCharacteristics of a Multinational Corporation Characteristic Description\nBenefits Challenges Examples Global Reach Operates and has a significant market\npresence in multiple countries. Access to diverse markets Navigating different\nregulations Coca-Cola, operating in over 200 countries and territories. Diverse\nOperations Engages in a wide range of business activities across different\nindustries and sectors.

Potential tax\nsavings through optimization Complex tax compliance, risk of penalties Starbucks\nCorp. (SBUX) has faced scrutiny controversy for using complex tax structures to\nshift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Financial Reporting Standards Reports\nfinancial information according to International Financial Reporting Standards.\nTransparency, comparability across borders Adhering to different accounting\nstandards Siemens AG (SIEGY), the German conglomerate, must adhere to diverse\nfinancial reporting standards across across jurisdictions.\n\n\nTYPES OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS\n\n * Decentralized corporation: This type of MNC maintains a presence in its home\n   country and has autonomous offices and other facilities globally. Each office\n   manages the local business itself, making its own decisions.\n * Centralized global corporation: A central headquarters is located in the home\n   country. Executive officers and management manage the overseas offices and\n   operations, as well as domestic operations. The subsidiaries must get\n   approval from headquarters for significant activities.\n * International division of a corporation: This is the part of an MNC\n   responsible for all global operations. They can function independently of\n   domestic operations, which can pose problems when overall corporate consensus\n   and action are required.\n * Transnational corporation: A parent-subsidiary structure in which the parent\n   company oversees the operations of subsidiaries in foreign countries and the\n   home country. Subsidiaries can use the parent's assets, such as research and\n   development data. Subsidiaries may be different brands. Though differentiated\n   in the past, the term is now virtually synonymous with MNCs.\n\n\nMULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS\n\nThe post-World War II era saw a significant acceleration in the growth of MNCs,\nfueled by advances in transportation, shipping, communication, and trade\nliberalization. The rise of global brands like Coca-Cola, International Business\nMachines Corporation (IBM), and McDonald's exhibited the growing reach and\ninfluence of MNCs.\n\nThese global entities had the power to shape economies, industries, and\nsocieties across borders, making them a force to be reckoned with in the modern\nworld. For critics, it seemed that as the armies of Europe receded from their\ncolonies, MNCs stepped in to take their place.\n\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MNCS\n\nSpanning continents and with the ability to mobilize resources larger than many\nnations' annual revenues, MNCs can drive economic growth and development for\nmillions. Multinationals have attracted praise for their benefits to economic\ngrowth and criticism for their potential to exert undue influence over so-called\n\"host\" countries\u2014those nations where their subsidiaries set up shop.\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and other economists generally credit MNCs'\npositive contributions to global development. Among the most significant is\ntheir ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), which can inject\nmuch-needed capital, technology, and expertise into an economy.\n\nThe most common method of FDI is when a multinational acquires a local firm, but\nit can include foreign joint ventures, constructing new plants, and reinvesting\nearnings in a foreign subsidiary. Given the natural involvement of MNCs in these\ninvestments, it's an indirect measure of their spread into new markets.\nAccording to the World Bank, total FDI inflows to developing countries were\n$1.37 trillion in 2023.\n\nTypically, economists analyze inflows for specific nations to see if MNCs and\nothers are finding a country a good place to invest. The more FDI coming into a\ncountry, the more jobs it can produce and the more taxes it can collect. FDI\ninflows don't include portfolio investments like buying bonds, stocks, and other\nassets in a foreign country without gaining ownership control.\n\nFor decades, the IMF argued for countries to increase their FDI inflows through\nlower taxes and less regulation (hence shrinking the size of the state), which\nits economists typically couch in the moral language of \"macroeconomic\ndiscipline.\" As such, for much of the post-colonial period, the IMF and other\nmultinational organizations have been pushing developing economies to attract\nMNCs to set up shop there, making FDI the most capital flows into less-developed\ncountries for the decades after decolonization.\n\n\nCRITIQUES OF MNCS\n\nHowever, this push for increased FDI has not been without its critics,\nparticularly those in developing countries. MNC influence has raised complex\nquestions about the role of foreign investment, the distribution of benefits,\nand popular and local sovereignty. Once an MNC moves into an area, it can often\nsideline local industries and then use its monopolistic hold to gain significant\npolitical influence in the country. Then, in moves reminiscent, for some, of the\nflows of capital during the era of state colonialism, the profits might be\nrepatriated by MNCs to their home country, limiting the benefits of FDI for host\ncountries. These issues have led to various responses from host governments,\nincluding protests, restrictions, exclusion, and even expropriation of MNCs.\n\nMeanwhile, it's become clear that many MNCs aren't returning their funds to\nwhere they're headquartered. As a percentage of GDP, the highest FDI inflows\naren't into the U.S. or newly opened markets but tax havens like the Cayman\nIslands, which have no corporate income, capital gains, or payroll taxes.\u00a0This\nmakes it an attractive destination for multinational corporations to park funds\nto minimize their taxes to the countries where that wealth was earned.\n\nCritiques of MNCs tend to fall under the following categories:\n\n * Environmental devastation: MNCs have been accused of prioritizing profits\n   over environmental protection, leading to deforestation, pollution, and\n   unsustainable resource extraction in the pursuit of cheap inputs.\n * Labor exploitation: Critics point to poor working conditions, low wages, and\n   lack of worker rights in many places where MNCs operate, amounting to a race\n   to the bottom in labor standards among the countries competing for FDI\n   inflows.\n * Tax avoidance: Countries worldwide lose billions in tax revenues due to\n   aggressive tax planning strategies MNCs use to shift profits to low-tax\n   jurisdictions.\n * Crowding out local businesses: The market power and economies of scale of\n   large MNCs make it difficult for local firms to compete, stifling local\n   entrepreneurs.\n * Political blackmail: Some argue that the IMF and World Bank's policy\n   prescriptions to attract FDI, such as deregulation and austerity, undermine\n   governments' ability to invest in public services and protect national\n   interests. However, giving up FDI would mean turning away funds needed for\n   local development, leading to Faustian bargains for many developing\n   countries.\n\n\nTHE SLOWDOWN IN FDI FLOWS\n\nBelow is a chart of the global FDI inflows as a percentage of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) in recent decades. As you can see, the percentage spikes at the\nturn of the millennium, during the financial crisis, and then immediately after.\nThis indicates a substantial increase in the flow of foreign capital into\neconomies worldwide, reflecting a growing interest from multinational\ncorporations and investors in expanding their operations and investments abroad.\nIt could also, of course, suggest moments when capital flowed abroad, when there\nwas significant volatility in the home markets. The largest FDI inflows occur\ninto the U.S. and other developed economies.\n\n\nDeveloping countries have encouraged FDI\u2014that is, the expansion of MNCs\u2014to\nfinance infrastructure and create new jobs for local workers. For their part,\nthe MNCs gain from FDI by expanding further into international markets.\n\nSeveral factors are said to drive increases in FDI inflows, a measure of MNC\nexpansion beyond their home countries' borders:\n\n * Economic liberalization: Many countries have opened up their economies to\n   foreign investment by reducing trade barriers, easing restrictions on capital\n   flows, and creating more favorable investment climates.\n * Technological advances: Improvements in communication and transportation have\n   made it easier for companies to operate across borders and manage global\n   supply chains.\n * Emerging markets: The rapid growth of emerging markets has created new\n   prospects for foreign investors seeking higher returns in relatively untapped\n   markets.\n * Financial globalization: The increasing integration of financial markets has\n   made cross-border capital flows possible and made it easier for investors to\n   invest in foreign projects.\n\nGlobal FDI flows have declined significantly as a share of GDP from around 3.3%\nin the 2000s to only 1.5% or so in recent years, and this drop has\ndisproportionately affected emerging markets. While FDI flows to developed\ncountries like the U.S. increased by 29% in 2023, flows to developing countries\ndecreased by 9%.\u00a0\n\nWhile the percentages and acronyms thrown around in many of these discussions\ncan seem abstract, the consequences are not. These represent millions of jobs,\nthe aspirations of local and regional economies, and massive inequalities\nworldwide that keep poverty entrenched in some regions of the globe.\n\nThe political stakes couldn't be higher. The terms economists use for the recent\ndrop in FDI flows include \"global economic fragmentation,\" which suggests a\nmovement away from a previous era's economic integration and globalization. The\ntrade wars between the U.S. and China, the pandemic, rising nationalism, and\nregional wars have upended earlier investment patterns, just as they have\nbillions of lives. We seem to have entered a new chapter, perhaps, in the\nhistory of the multinational corporation.\n\n\n\nWHY WOULD A BUSINESS WANT TO BECOME A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY?\n\nUsually, a business's primary goal is to increase profits and growth. If it can\ngrow a global customer base and increase its market share abroad, it may believe\nopening offices in foreign countries is worth the expense and effort. Companies\nmay benefit from certain tax structures or regulatory regimes found abroad.\n\n\nHOW DO MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS INFLUENCE GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES?\n\nMNCs greatly affect trade policies through lobbying efforts and economic\ndiplomacy. They advocate for trade agreements and regulations that favor their\nbusiness operations, often helping to shape policies to reduce tariffs, improve\nmarket access, and protect intellectual property rights. MNCs leverage their\neconomic might to negotiate favorable terms with governments, influencing\ninternational trade to attain environments conducive to their growth.\n\n\nWHAT ARE SOME RISKS MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS FACE?\n\nMultinational corporations are exposed to risks related to the different\ncountries and regions in which they operate. These can include regulatory or\nlegal risks, political instability, crime and violence, cultural sensitivities,\nand fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nMultinational corporations are as influential as any stakeholders in the global\neconomy, with the potential to drive economic growth and development in the\ncountries where they operate. However, their impact on host countries,\nparticularly in the developing world, is not without controversy. While MNCs can\nbring valuable foreign direct investment, technology, and expertise, they also\nraise concerns about exploitation, loss of sovereignty, and uneven distribution\nof benefits.\n\nAs global FDI flows decline, especially in developing countries, policymakers,\nbusinesses, and civil society must work together to create a more balanced and\nequitable framework for international investment. Ultimately, the role of MNCs\nin global development is complex and constantly evolving, shaped by the actions\nand decisions of countless stakeholders worldwide.",
        "summary": "A multinational corporation (MNC) has business operations in at least two countries, often with headquarters in one country and subsidiaries, manufacturing plants, and offices in other nations. MNCs have expanded rapidly in recent decades because of falling trade barriers, the search for new markets, expanding global supply chains.",

        "content": "We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart\nproductivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. Yet it\ncould also replace jobs and deepen inequality.\n\nThe rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated the world, causing\nboth excitement and alarm, and raising important questions about its potential\nimpact on the global economy. The net effect is difficult to foresee, as AI will\nripple through economies in complex ways. What we can say with some confidence\nis that we will need to come up with a set of policies to safely leverage the\nvast potential of AI for the benefit of humanity.\n\nReshaping the Nature of Work\n\nIn a new analysis, IMF staff examine the potential impact of AI on the global\nlabor market. Many studies have predicted the likelihood that jobs will be\nreplaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases AI is likely to complement human\nwork. The IMF analysis captures both these forces.\n\nThe findings are striking: almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to\nAI. Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect\nroutine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact\nhigh-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from\nAI\u2014but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits\u2014compared with emerging\nmarket and developing economies.\n\nIn advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly\nhalf the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity.\nFor the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by\nhumans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced\nhiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.\n\nIn emerging markets and low-income countries, by contrast, AI exposure is\nexpected to be 40 percent and 26 percent, respectively. These findings suggest\nemerging market and developing economies face fewer immediate disruptions from\nAI. At the same time, many of these countries don\u2019t have the infrastructure or\nskilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over\ntime the technology could worsen inequality among nations.\n\n\n\nAI could also affect income and wealth inequality within countries. We may see\npolarization within income brackets, with workers who can harness AI seeing an\nincrease in their productivity and wages\u2014and those who cannot falling behind.\nResearch\u00a0shows that AI can help less experienced workers enhance their\nproductivity more quickly. Younger workers may find it easier to exploit\nopportunities, while older workers could struggle to adapt.\n\nThe effect on labor income will largely depend on the extent to which AI will\ncomplement high-income workers. If AI significantly complements higher-income\nworkers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase in their labor income.\nMoreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI will likely boost\ncapital returns, which may also favor high earners. Both of these phenomena\ncould exacerbate inequality.\n\nIn most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend\nthat policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from\nfurther stoking social tensions. It is crucial for countries to establish\ncomprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programs for vulnerable\nworkers. In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting\nlivelihoods and curbing inequality.\n\nAn Inclusive AI-Driven World\n\nAI is being integrated into businesses around the world at remarkable speed,\nunderscoring the need for policymakers to act.\n\nTo help countries craft the right policies, the IMF has developed an AI\nPreparedness Index that measures readiness in areas such as digital\ninfrastructure, human-capital and labor-market policies, innovation and economic\nintegration, and regulation and ethics.\n\nThe human-capital and labor-market policies component, for example, evaluates\nelements such as years of schooling and job-market mobility, as well as the\nproportion of the population covered by social safety nets. The regulation and\nethics component assesses the adaptability to digital business models of a\ncountry\u2019s legal framework and the presence of strong governance for effective\nenforcement.\n\nUsing the index, IMF staff assessed the readiness of 125 countries. The findings\nreveal that wealthier economies, including advanced and some emerging market\neconomies, tend to be better equipped for AI adoption than low-income countries,\nthough there is considerable variation across countries. Singapore, the United\nStates and Denmark posted the highest scores on the index, based on their strong\nresults in all four categories tracked.\n\n\n\nGuided by the insights from the AI Preparedness Index, advanced economies should\nprioritize AI innovation and integration while developing robust regulatory\nframeworks. This approach will cultivate a safe and responsible AI environment,\nhelping maintain public trust. For emerging market and developing economies, the\npriority should be laying a strong foundation through investments in digital\ninfrastructure and a digitally competent workforce.\n\nThe AI era is upon us, and it is still within our power to ensure it brings\nprosperity for all.\n\n\u2014For more on artificial intelligence and the economy, see the December issue\u00a0of\nFinance & Development, the IMF\u2019s quarterly magazine.\n\n",
