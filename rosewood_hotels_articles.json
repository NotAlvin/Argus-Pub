        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- Driven by a sense of purpose to build a future where people\nand place enrich one another, Rosewood Hotel Group is proud to announce\u00a0Rosewood\nImpacts, a groupwide roadmap for delivering positive impact on all its\ncommunities and the planet we call home. With deeper commitments to empowering\npeople across the brand's entire ecosystem and a sustainability approach that\nputs circular hospitality at the core of business operations, Rosewood Impacts\nis both a recognition of the group's ongoing programs and a strategic roadmap\nfor future efforts. With tangible goals in the fields of sustainability,\nemployment, partnerships and more, the comprehensive roadmap champions\nconsequential policies and programming under two distinct pillars: Rosewood\nEmpowers and Rosewood Sustains.\n\n\n\nRosewood Hotel Group is proud to announce Rosewood Impacts, a groupwide roadmap\nfor delivering positive impact on all its communities and the planet we call\nhome.\n\n\n\nRosewood Mayakoba\u2019s work with Centro Educativo K\u2019iin Beh, a non-profit school in\nthe Riviera Maya, Mexico.\n\n\n\nAn indisputable environmental steward, Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo is the centerpoint of\nthe Cidade Matarazzo Complex \u2013 the largest upcycling project of a century-old\nproperty in Brazil.\n\n\"At Rosewood Hotel Group, we are wholly committed to rooting ourselves more\ndeeply in every place we are in. With Rosewood Impacts, we are not only\nchampioning the exemplary efforts being made across our organization but setting\nnew benchmarks for positive impact that will propel us forward to a more\nsustainable and equitable tomorrow,\" says Sonia Cheng, Chief Executive Officer\nof Rosewood Hotel Group. \"We are proud of the work that our group has\naccomplished over the last forty-plus years of operations, but firmly maintain\nthat we must do more.\"\n\nRosewood Empowers\u00a0\nRosewood Empowers encapsulates the group's belief that equal access to\nopportunity is the key to uplifting communities. To this end, Rosewood is\ndedicated to:\n\n * Opportunity Employment, seeking talent from underserved or underrepresented\n   groups and working to lower barriers to employment.\n * Uplifting livelihoods by strengthening local economies through local hiring,\n   sourcing and partnerships.\n * Education, investing in our collective future by empowering people through\n   education and upskilling.\n\nThrough all Rosewood Empowers programs and initiatives, Rosewood's A Sense of\nPlace\u00ae philosophy ensures that the brand's efforts speak to and support the\ncommunities and environments where each property sits. An exemplary case study\nis Rosewood Mayakoba's work with Centro Educativo K'iin Beh, a non-profit school\nin the Riviera Maya, Mexico. With a mission to support not only the hotel\nemployees who needed adequate schooling for their children but the larger\ncommunity, the resort's leaders raised resources required to reopen the school\nin 2017, after a number of challenges threatened its ongoing operations and\nforced it to temporarily shut its doors. Today, the school welcomes over 400\nstudents, all of whom receive economic support for tuition and supplies through\nRosewood Mayakoba's scholarship program. The resort brings guests into the\nimpact journey through fundraising and a special volunteer and donation program,\n\"Padrino,\" that ensures the continued development of the students. In Fall 2022,\nguests' donations contributed to the development and launch of the center's new\nHigh School, allowing local youth to continue their education.\n\nIn Asia, Rosewood Hong Kong's commitment to the local community is further\nrealized through the BluHouse, Rosewood Hotel Group's first restaurant inspired\nby the concept of a business-with-purpose. BluHouse is committed to co-creating\nneighborhood resilience through donations, employment, and impactful experiences\nin support of underserved groups in Hong Kong. The restaurant has pledged 1% of\nrevenue towards this mission, and leverages the group's Opportunity Employment\nprogram to partner with NGOs to offer employment to refugees and ethnic\nminorities and close the opportunity gap.\n\nThe groupwide Opportunity Employment program is building a new pipeline of\ntalent from underserved groups not just in Hong Kong, but across its global\nportfolio in 20 countries. Properties from London and Vienna to Sao Paulo and\nPhuket are reaching out to the most overlooked groups in their neighborhoods,\nincluding minorities, people with disabilities refugees and others, and hiring\nfrom them. A newly launched program, Rosewood Bridges, is about connecting young\npeople from disadvantaged backgrounds with internships at the group's hotels.\nStarting with sending vocational students from the Hong Kong Vocational Training\nCouncil abroad for internships\u2014an opportunity not typically available in\nvocational education\u2014to partnering with local NGOs to give young people with\nautism a chance of a career at Rosewood Beijing or Guangzhou, the group is\nacting on its commitment to be a truly inclusive company.\n\nRosewood Sustains\u00a0\nRosewood Sustains showcases a commitment to growing Rosewood's lifestyle\necosystem responsibly and protecting the environment for future generations.\nFrom pursuing carbon neutrality, to engaging in regenerative practices, to\ndriving the evolution of circular hospitality and eventually eliminating waste,\nthe Group has set significant targets for environmental sustainability. These\ninclude:\n\n * Diverting 70% of waste away from landfills and incinerators by 2025.\n * Reducing energy use and water consumption by 25% by 2025.\n * Eliminating single-use plastics across the portfolio as soon as possible.\n * Achieving 50% carbon-neutral status by 2035 and complete carbon-neutral\n   status by 2050.\n\nAn indisputable environmental steward, Rosewood\u00a0S\u00e3o Paulo is the centerpoint of\nthe Cidade Matarazzo Complex \u2013 the largest upcycling project of a century-old\nproperty in Brazil. Supported by a dedicated solar farm as well as\ncollaborations with local government agencies, the hotel achieved its mission\nfor 100% of its energy supply to be fully sustainable in early January 2023,\nless than a year after opening. This will amount to an estimated savings of\n17.342 tons of CO2 emissions annually. Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo also vows to run a\nwaste management program where 100% of all solid and organic disposables will be\nrecycled and reused, and the property houses a biodigester and glass crushing\nmachine to minimize having to outsource these sustainable measures.\n\nIn The Bahamas, a nation of islands with 95% of its territory underwater,\nRosewood Baha Mar is preserving the pristine marine environment off Nassau's\nCable Beach through its partnership with The Bahamas Reef Environment\nEducational Foundation (BREEF) and educating the next generation of Bahamians\nand visitors on how to protect coral reefs, which are critical both for\necosystem preservation and for supporting local livelihoods dependent on\nfishing. Guests are invited to take a hands-on approach through Rosewood's\nCitizen Science Program, where they can enjoy a snorkeling adventure with\nexperienced ocean guides, with 100% of the proceeds going to BREEF. They can\nalso adopt coral fragments to plant within the surrounding waters and volunteer\nfor local beach clean-ups with the organization.\n\nAt the forthcoming Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort, opening on the Big Island of\nHawai'i this summer, the brand's principles of circular hospitality, operational\nsustainability, and environmental stewardship come together in a way that\nensures both the health of the environment and the longevity of culture.\u00a0A\ncommitment to the environment is evident throughout the entire property, which\nhas been designed for LEED Gold Certification and is powered by 100% solar\nenergy, while an on-site cultural center provides both visitors and locals with\nperspective into the rich natural and cultural significance of the surroundings.\n\nRosewood Sustains is being championed by the group's outstanding restaurants as\nwell. Caruso's at Rosewood Miramar Beach has truly put sustainability at its\ncore and been recognized for it through the award of a Green Michelin star.\nHelmed by Chef Massimo, who has built strong relationships with surrounding\nfarms, the restaurant sources most of its ingredients from a 5\u20136-mile radius\naround the resort and is committed to giving all food waste to farmers to use as\ncompost. Multiple properties including Rosewood Hong Kong, Rosewood Bermuda and\nRosewood London have partnered with EcoSpirits, a low-carbon, low-waste spirits\ndistributor, to champion circularity in the food and beverage space.\u00a0\n\n\"Both Rosewood Empowers and Rosewood Sustains have been designed to work in\nharmony together,\" Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed, Vice President of Social Impact for\nRosewood Hotel Group, explains. \"We are committed to doing business in a way\nthat drives the hospitality industry's evolution towards circularity and\nenvironmental conservation while simultaneously uplifting all our communities.\"\nExpressing excitement about the group's ambitions, she adds, \"our actions today\nhave a direct impact on the long-term viability of the planet. Being part of a\ncompany that's making it clear that our efforts can no longer be secondary but\nmust sit at the forefront of everything we do gives my hope for our collective\nfuture.\"\n\nRosewood Impacts represents the overall principle that true impact is the most\npowerful when the social and environmental are considered holistically. Through\nthis framework, the brand is able to measure its success and continue to set\nambitious benchmarks. Rosewood is proud of the advancements the entire group has\nmade towards the Rosewood Impacts mission, but recognizes that more must be\ndone, and is evolving every part of the business and operational strategies with\nthis in mind. With Rosewood Impacts at the leading edge, Rosewood Hotel Group\nlooks to the future with optimism.\n\nAbout Rosewood Hotel Group\nRosewood Hotel Group, a privately owned company, is one of the world's leading\nglobal lifestyle and hospitality management groups.

The castle, originally a hunting lodge for the\nPrince-Archbishops of Salzburg, dates back to 1461. Long a part of the Holy\nRoman Empire, the area became part of Austria in 1803. The last\nPrince-Archbishop who exercised secular authority, Count Hieronymus von\nColloredo, is remembered today as a patron of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,\na native of Salzburg.\n\nThe resort offers a look at the area\u2019s history and culture with personalized\ntours curated by the Rosewood concierge team. Cultural programming includes\nbehind the scenes experiences with famous Austrian umbrella craftsman, Mr.\nKirchtag, and private tours of Festspielhaus, Salzburg\u2019s historic opera hall.\n\nThe 100-year-old Salzburg Festival, which features opera, drama and concerts, is\nworld-renowned. The opening of Rosewood Schloss Fuschl is well-timed for the\n2024 festival, which begins July 19 and stretches into August.\n\nSalzburg was not only once the home of the Von Trapp family but was also a\nfilming location for The Sound of Music. Aficionados of the film can enjoy\nFraulein Maria\u2019s bicycle tour or visit a \u201cSound of Music\u201d puppet performance at\nthe Marionette Theater in Salzburg. The setting and lakeside ambiance may create\nsome somber thoughts of a different Austria.\n\nThe Rosewood Schloss Fuschl also offers more conventional adventure in the Alps,\nsuch as hikes with an herbalist to explore the flora and fauna, as well as\ncooking demonstrations by local experts in nearby alpine huts. The area offers\nmany scenic views of the forests and mountains. The highest peak in Salzburg is\nthe Grossvenediger (3,666 m/11,998 ft).\n\n1964: Actress Julie Andrews performs musical number in the movie \"The Sound Of\nMusic\" directed by ... [+] Robert Wise.

The fishing trips end with smoked fish\nwrapped in newspaper just like the locals eat it, washed down with Austrian\nwine.\n\nFor outdoor recreation, the area offers golf, tennis, biking and horseback\nriding in addition to hiking. In the winter, there is ice skating, tobogganing\nand skiing.\n\nThe resort says that by sourcing most ingredients and materials from within a\n100-kilometer radius, it not only ensures freshness but also reduces carbon\nemissions associated with transportation. The Schloss Fuschl honeybee colony\nproduces local honey and plays a crucial role in pollinating the surrounding\nflowers. And by harnessing the thermal properties of the lake, Rosewood Schloss\nFuschl reduces its reliance on traditional heating and cooling methods.\n\nThe Gr\u00fcner Salon at the new Rosewood Schloss Fuschl hotel.

        "content": "Rosewood Hotel Group, one of the world\u2019s leading global lifestyle and\nhospitality management groups, continues to expand its global footprint and\nevolve its four brands \u2013 Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\u00ae, New World\u00ae Hotels &\nResorts, Asaya, and Carlyle & Co.; and residential business, Rosewood\nResidences. Over the last five years, the Group has experienced ambitious yet\nthoughtful growth, with its ultra-luxury Rosewood Hotels & Resorts brand signing\nan impressive number of new deals compared to its competitive set. Following a\nmonumental 2023 which introduced the Group into new global territories,\nincluding New Zealand and Hawaii; and lifestyle categories, including\nexperiential retail; 2024 promises to deliver even more new deal signings,\nproperty openings and enriching experiences in the world\u2019s most inspiring\ndestinations.\n\n\nA GROWING, GLOBAL PRESENCE\n\nRosewood Hotel Group\u2019s combined portfolio now consists of 48 hotels, resorts,\nand residences across 23 countries, each embracing the brand's A Sense of Place\u00ae\nphilosophy to reflect the individual location's history, culture, and\nsensibilities. For Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, 2023 saw three properties open:\nRosewood Munich, Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort, and the brand\u2019s New Zealand\nlodge collection consisting of Rosewood Cape Kidnappers, Rosewood Kauri Cliffs\nand Rosewood Matakauri. These launches represented the Group\u2019s first flags in\nGermany, Hawai\u2019i, and New Zealand, respectively, and brought Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts\u2019 total hotel count to 33 properties across 21 countries. For New World\nHotels & Resorts, the past year featured the launches of three new properties,\nwhich was a record for this growing brand and brought the total portfolio count\nto 15 properties. This development further expanded New World\u2019s footprint in\nVietnam and China, raising the brand\u2019s flag in Hoi An, Taishan and Guangzhou.\n\nEqually as impressive as the Group\u2019s operational portfolio is its curated\npipeline of projects, each of which has been thoughtfully considered to inspire\nadventure and discovery. Today, Rosewood Hotel Group has 35 properties under\ndevelopment, reflecting one of the industry\u2019s strongest pipelines when\nconsidered as a percentage of a brand\u2019s complete portfolio. While the Group\u2019s\npipeline has been consistently impressive, it is the past five years which have\nmade a profound impact on the trajectory of the company globally and its status\nas a leader in the industry.\n\nSix new deal signings for Rosewood Hotels & Resorts in 2023 contributed to this\npositioning. These include Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\u2019 first-ever properties in\nBarbuda, Greece, South Korea and the Maldives, together underscoring the brand\u2019s\ncommitment to bringing its unique approach to hospitality to both cultural\ncapitals and exotic island destinations. Rosewood Amaala was also announced in\n2023, which will mark the brand\u2019s fourth property in Saudi Arabia upon opening.\nThe deal to manage the iconic Robertson Lodges in New Zealand was also penned in\n2023.\n\n\nAREAS OF EXPANSION\n\nThese additions reiterate Rosewood\u2019s strategic areas for expansion. Having just\ngrown its presence in Europe by 100% in less than three years, the region\ncontinues to be a key focus for the Group. 2024 will see the opening of Rosewood\nAmsterdam in the Netherlands and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl in Austria, followed in\n2025 by new properties in Greece, Venice, Milan, Rome, and a second London\nhotel, The Chancery Rosewood.\n\nThe Middle East\u2019s propensity for luxury hospitality has been similarly central\nto the Group\u2019s strategic future expansion, with several new properties set to\njoin its Middle Eastern portfolio. Building upon its current presence in Abu\nDhabi and Jeddah, Rosewood Doha will open its doors in Qatar this year. In the\nMiddle East, future growth is focused on Saudi Arabia, whose ongoing\ntransformation for a new era of travel aligns naturally with Rosewood\u2019s\ntrailblazing reputation for impeccable, first-class service. Three new hotels\nare set to debut in Saudi Arabia in the coming years: Rosewood Diriyah in 2025,\nalongside the future openings Rosewood Red Sea and Rosewood Amaala.\n\nThe pipeline for Rosewood Hotel Group also continues to grow in Asia Pacific,\nand in 2024 will see the opening of Rosewood Miyakojima, marking Rosewood\u2019s\nentry into Japan. New World Chongqing Hotel in China will also debut in the\nforeseeable future. Looking further ahead, future openings in China include\nRosewood Shenzhen, Rosewood Hangzhou, Rosewood Shanghai, Rosewood Chongqing,\nRosewood Ningbo, and Rosewood Xi\u2019An. In the greater Asia Pacific region,\nanticipated destinations include Rosewood Hoi An, Rosewood Seoul and Rosewood\nRanfaru in the Maldives.\n\nIn the Americas, development stretches across The United States, Mexico, and The\nCaribbean. 2025 will add Rosewood Mexico City and Rosewood Mandarina to the\ngrowing portfolio of properties in Mexico. Looking ahead, another icon will be\nreborn under the Rosewood flag with Rosewood The Raleigh in Miami Beach, which\nwill include 44 Rosewood Residences in a newly built Peter Marino-designed\nbuilding. Also consisting of both a resort and residential experience will be\nRosewood Barbuda, opening on the exquisite Caribbean island in 2028.\n\n\nENRICHED LIVING, EVERY DAY\n\nRosewood Hotels & Resorts' branded residential business, Rosewood Residences, is\na refined collection of estate homes, luxury villas and serviced apartments\ncarefully curated to enrich the lives of all who call them home. Currently\nconsisting of 14 properties across ten countries, this collection allows owners\nand guests to unlock an elevated lifestyle supported by the very best in design,\namenities, and service.\n\nFor the last several years, Rosewood Residences has been experiencing\nexceptional growth, with the number of projects in development currently sitting\nat an all-time high. The industry has taken notice: in the 2023 Brand Residences\nReport produced by Savills [1], one of the world\u2019s pioneering real estate\nadvisors and consultancies, Rosewood Residences ranked 4th in its competitive\nset of independent luxury brands in regard to the number of completed and\npipeline projects.\n\nA highlight of this pipeline is six standalone residential properties, the first\nof which was only announced in 2021. The rapid growth of Rosewood Residences\u2019\nstandalone properties is a further proof point of guests\u2019 growing desire to\naccess the Rosewood lifestyle beyond the hotel and resort experiences. In 2023,\ntwo such destinations were identified and announced: Rosewood Residences\nHillsboro Beach in Florida and Rosewood Residences Turtle Creek in Dallas,\nTexas. These newly announced projects join the additional standalone pipeline\nproperties of Rosewood Residences Naples and Rosewood Residences Lido Key, both\nin Florida; Rosewood Residences Kamala in Phuket, and Rosewood Residences\nBeverly Hills in California. The Beverly Hills property will open later this\nyear to officially debut the exclusively residential Rosewood experience.\n\nAlongside these standalone properties in the pipeline are four Rosewood\nResidences that will be co-located within a hotel or resort property, including\nRosewood Residences Mandarina, Rosewood Residences Miami Beach, Rosewood\nResidences Doha, and Rosewood Residences Barbuda.\n\nAcross both the standalone and mixed-use properties in operation as well as in\ndevelopment, the team is continuously raising the bar to deliver an elevated\nlifestyle experience that speaks to the unique needs of today\u2019s buyer. New and\ninnovative offerings introduced or announced by Rosewood Residences in the last\nyear include elevated food and beverage services, such as expert wine curation,\nprivate restaurants and bars, and curated in-home dining; dedicated shared and\nprivate spaces for visiting guests, younger residents, and pets; indoor and\noutdoor amenities and social areas designed specifically for entertaining; and,\nof course, a range of state-of-the-art wellness experiences. As wellness is a\ntop priority for many people today, Rosewood Residences has taken great care to\nintroduce new opportunities for residents and guests to stay well, from paddle\ntennis and pickleball courts, private salons and spas, to rooftop yoga pitches\nand pools.\n\nIn the end, Rosewood Residences\u2019 impressive growth of its physical footprint and\ninnovative offerings contributed to a 135% increase in sales year over year in\n2023, with total sales amounting to $434 million. This demand underscores that\nRosewood Residences are providing buyers with the type of modern-day living that\nthey are looking for and a community of which they wish to be an active\nparticipant.\n\n\nASAYA: INTEGRATED APPROACH TO WELLNESS\n\nAsaya, Rosewood\u2019s integrated, holistic health and wellness concept designed to\nunlock long-lasting and transformative well-being, will flourish in 2024 with\nnew launches and unique experiences. Since its inception at Rosewood Phuket in\n2017, Asaya has launched in five additional locations. Today, there is Asaya\nActive at Rosewood Guangzhou, Asaya Retreat at Rosewood Hong Kong, and Asaya Spa\nat Rosewood Vienna, Rosewood Munich, and Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort. The\nopenings in Munich and Hawai\u2019i in 2023 constitute growth of the Asaya concept by\n50%. This past year also saw 10% growth of Asaya\u2019s membership model, which is\navailable in certain urban destinations including Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and now\nMunich.\n\nUnderstanding how holistic well-being is foundational to a fulfilling life, the\nevolution of Asaya is of paramount importance to Rosewood Hotel Group in 2024\nand beyond. Today, there are 19 Asayas in the pipeline at both future and\nexisting Rosewood properties. In the coming year, seven will debut, reflecting\nthe brand\u2019s largest single-year expansion to date. All four of Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts\u2019 new 2024 openings \u2013 Rosewood Doha, Rosewood Miyakojima, Rosewood\nSchloss Fuschl, and Rosewood Amsterdam \u2013 will feature Asaya.

In\naddition, existing properties Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo, Rosewood Mayakoba and Rosewood\nSand Hill will also introduce the Asaya experience. In keeping with the Rosewood\nbrand\u2019s guiding philosophy, each Asaya will offer immersive programming inspired\nby the destination in which it sits, with practices informed by local culture\nand heritage. Each new Asaya will further deliver exclusive treatments and\nproducts from some of the most innovative wellness brands in the world,\nincluding Dr. Barbara Sturm within Rosewood Doha and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl and\nGuerlain at Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo. These partnerships reflect the brand\u2019s\ncommitment to providing preeminent wellness experiences that are both\nestablished and innovative.\n\n\nRAREFIED RETAIL\n\nMarking the brand\u2019s growing presence as a luxury lifestyle brand, Rosewood\nHotels & Resorts continued its expansion into the retail space in 2023 with the\nlaunch of new e-commerce storefronts for nine of its hotels \u2013 including Rosewood\nSand Hill, Rosewood Miramar Beach, and Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort. This was\nthe most storefronts to launch in a single year since Rosewood first entered\ninto the e-commerce space in 2019, and brought the total number of platforms to\n13. These channels invite Rosewood aficionados to bring home an element of the\nhotel experience and purchase incredible experiences.\n\nIn 2023, Rosewood further strengthened its retail proposition through an\nexclusive partnership with The Webster, a luxury multi-brand retailer offering\nfashion, accessories, beauty and homeware. The partnership commenced with a\nsummer pop-up series across Rosewood Miramar Beach in California and Rosewood\nMansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, which invited Rosewood guests to shop\nexclusive collections inspired by these distinctive destinations. In celebration\nof the 2023 festive season, the partnership further included a bespoke retail\nedit to shop online. The edit consisted of The Webster\u2019s founder, Laure Heriard\nDubr\u00e9uil\u2019s personal picks for the holidays.

In an industry projected to more\nthan double from its current valuation of around $140bn to almost $300bn\nby\u00a02030, they compete with the independent and multibrand conglomerate\ncategories alike.\n\nIts pipeline of 28 hotels is formidable even by industry leaders\u2019 standards\n(Four Seasons, a behemoth with $4.3bn in revenue in 2022, has around 50).\nRosewood\u2019s reimagining of Venice\u2019s storied Bauer Hotel, slated to open in 2025,\nis one of several heritage European projects, along with Amsterdam, Salzburg,\nMilan and Rome, all on the heels of Vienna opening last year, and Munich opening\nlast week. Two resorts in Saudi Arabia, part of that country\u2019s\ntrillion-dollar-plus Vision 2030 development initiatives, will open by 2026,\nalong with a Riyadh hotel. Weeks before we meet, Cheng signed a deal to take\nover the three award-winning Robertson Lodges in New Zealand. There are urban\nflagships on the way in Shanghai, Mexico City and \u2013 the most buzzed-about \u2013 a\nnew, second hotel in London, where Rosewood is currently gutting the former US\nEmbassy building on Grosvenor Square, with Sir David Chipperfield leading the\narchitecture and interiors team.\n\nLas Ventanas al Para\u00edso in Mexico\n\n\u201cThe key is to design a hotel that doesn\u2019t feel like a\u00a0hotel,\u201d Cheng says. She\nwants to make environments to\u00a0appeal as much to the next-door neighbour as to\nthe guest who\u2019s arrived from several time zones away. \u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0a very important\ningredient of this brand; it\u2019s how we\u2019ve differentiated. We want to make it\nresonate with the neighbourhood, to make people say when they walk in, \u2018This is\na place I can hang out with my friends.\u2019 We curate every single space [to that\nend].\u201d\n\nIf all that lands a bit like boilerplate lifted straight from the press\nliterature of Luxury Hotel Company X, consider the Rosewood London, whose 10th\nanniversary the company is celebrating this year \u2013 the first hotel Cheng opened\nafter being appointed CEO, aged 28. She had a degree in applied mathematics from\nHarvard, and a few years each at Morgan Stanley and Warburg Pincus under her\nbelt, but\u00a0zero formal hospitality experience. The Edwardian pile on High Holborn\nwas formerly part of the Renaissance chain. Sceptics (including your writer)\nquestioned the wisdom of locating a property intended to compete with the likes\nof Claridge\u2019s in the weird socio-demographic selva oscura between Covent Garden\nand Fleet Street. \u201cPeople told me I was crazy, that we\u2019d never be able to\nattract the foot traffic we\u2019d need. But it\u2019s such a beautiful building; I don\u2019t\nthink there\u2019s another courtyard like that in any hotel in London,\u201d she says.\u00a0\n\nCheng introduced the Holborn Dining Room \u2013 an all\u2011day British brasserie with\nfire engine-red banquettes, waiters in fitted waistcoats and forage caps, and\ntruffle fries and gourmet pies on the menu. Across the portico was Scarfes, a\ncocktail bar lined with bespoke cartoons by celebrated English illustrator\nGerald Scarfe, presided over by world-class mixologists. Within a couple\u00a0of\nmonths, both were doing brisk trades; the bar\u00a0regularly had a queue out the\ndoor. In the hotel itself,\u00a0the suites flowed like high-spec apartments: antique\ndesks, minibars in lacquered oriental cabinets, proper kitchens with tile floors\nand gallery-hung walls. Cheng, known in the industry for having her hands\ndeep\u00a0in the design side of things (\u201cI love it \u2013 I have a really\u00a0strong team, but\nwith certain flagship properties I\u00a0still get quite involved\u201d), had tapped Tony\nChi and Martin\u00a0Brudnizki (now a ubiquitous force in hotel design,\u00a0but then still\nan emerging star).\n\nRosewood Beijing followed a similar strategy in 2014: create something\nunexpected for the city \u2013 sleek but laid-back, full of greenery, with a haute\nhot-pot caf\u00e9 in place of\u00a0the conventional Michelin-endorsed destination. Within\nthree months of opening, Cheng says, its RevPAR (revenue per available room) was\nnumber one in the market, despite Rosewood having no other Asian presence and no\nloyalty programme.\n\nTen years and some 20 openings later, her disruptive successes have put paid to\nmuch of the nepo baby-centric speculation that initially surrounded her\nappointment \u2013 and made Rosewood popular with the industry\u2019s blue-chip investment\npartners. The brand\u2019s tagline, \u201cA Sense of Place\u201d, may predate her tenure as\nchief executive, but it\u2019s Cheng who imbued it with the tangible signifiers that\ndeliver returns.\n\nThe new Rosewood Munich, housed in a former bank Cheng in the Tristan\nAuer-designed Boudoir, in the lobby of the H\u00f4tel de Crillon \u00a9 Julien Lienard\n\nHenry Cheng\u2019s acquisition of the company was \u201cbrilliant move number one\u201d, says\nJames McBride, CEO of\u00a0Nihi hotels and an industry doyen of almost 40 years.\n\u201cBrilliant move number two was putting Sonia in charge.\u201d For a decade before\nCheng acquired Rosewood, McBride ran The Carlyle in New York, one of the most\nrecognised names in its original portfolio; numerous colleagues from his time as\na senior director at Ritz-Carlton have gone on to work with Cheng. McBride\npraises her \u201cgreat instincts and engaged leadership\u201d, her aptitude for site\nselection and conversion, and her skill at recruiting top talent (while hotel\nGMs who\u2019ve found her management style to be overly controlling are not unheard\nof, more often what\u2019s expressed is admiration). \u201cThe excitement, the momentum\n[that currently surrounds the brand] can be felt from afar. She has created that\nlightning-in-a-bottle thing, and I think she\u2019s only getting started.\u201d\n\nBut luxury hospitality moves fast. \u201cMy goal is to be a purpose-led luxury\nlifestyle brand,\u201d she declares. \u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Who are your hotel\ncompetitors?\u2019 \u2013 of course, we have them, but in my mind I compare us to luxury\nbrands; I want us to be learning from retail and fashion, those different\nspaces.\u201d Making them an actual part of the Rosewood brand is in the strategy as\nwell: the lunch Cheng hosts with H\u00e9riard Dubreuil in Paris\u00a0is to celebrate a\nseries of Rosewood-The Webster pop-ups in the US, a collaboration that will be\nevolved across more locations, possibly as permanent retail presences with\nprivate shopping privileges.\n\nSustainability is now in the mix \u201cfrom the moment we start planning\u201d, Cheng\nsays, noting that today\u2019s luxury consumers are more societally and\nenvironmentally conscious. \u201cWe need to build it [into the hardware], but also\nmake it part of the experience.\u201d The company recently inaugurated Rosewood\nImpacts as its official ESG initiative, but various policies and implementations\ngo back years.\u00a0\n\nBemelmans Bar in The Carlyle New York \u00a9 Jennifer Cooke\n\nWhen I admit to having struggled with the lofty, vaguely worded Impacts\nliterature her press office had provided, she immediately starts ticking off\nconcrete executions: The Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo, a new-build that opened in 2022,\nruns on 100 per cent renewable energy, has its own waste-management facilities,\nand around 75 per cent of building materials used were locally produced or\nupcycled (or both).\u00a0Kona Village Resort, on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, which Rosewood\nre-flagged earlier this year, is now powered by 8,000 solar panels \u2013 the largest\nprivate micro-grid in the state, and the only one to run entirely on solar. She\ntells me the company is ahead of schedule on its 2050 carbon-neutrality target\n(which is more than can be said of a few big western democracies\u2019 net-zero\nefforts).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFamily travel is seen through this lens as well. \u201cWhen we were first thinking\nabout kids\u2019 experiences in\u00a0the hotels [years ago], one of my team members had\nall sorts of ideas for digital experiences, all focused on that kind of\ninterface.\u201d She looks at me in disbelief and laughs. \u201cI just went, \u2018Actually,\nno! The opposite! Hands-on, high-touch\u2019\u201d \u2013 get them in nature, into local\ncommunities. \u201cThey\u2019re always in front of a screen at home, this is one of\u00a0their\nonly chances not to be. I mean, why are you even\u00a0travelling?\u201d She cites plans to\ncreate kids\u2019 \u201clearning retreats\u201d at a Maldives resort slated to open in a couple\nof years \u2013 several-days-long educational programmes (\u201cor 10 days, or even two\nweeks\u201d), focused on marine conservation \u2013 as an example of the company\u2019s\ndirection.\n\nHer other three brands \u2013 Rosewood Residences, Asaya (the company\u2019s wellness\nconcept, with currently just six locations, three in Asia) and Carlyle & Co, the\nmembers\u2019 club \u2013 are moving ahead at different paces. \u201cWe launched Asaya in Hong\nKong with the idea to have it be\u00a0a\u00a0holistic offering. That meant not just [spa]\nbut nutritionists, a lot of post-maternity treatments, visiting practitioners.\u201d\nI ask if she personally finds the wellness space interesting, and am politely\nstonewalled: \u201cI think it has a lot of potential.\u201d But does she find carving out\na meaningful wellness brand in the luxury hotel market \u2013 where terms like\nbiohacking and epigenetics now get thrown about as regularly as lomi lomi\nmassage and lift facial once were \u2013 a challenge? \u201cOur target audience obviously\ncares about wellbeing. So how does Rosewood play a role in facilitating that?\nBut I don\u2019t think we should overcomplicate it; just be authentic. I don\u2019t\nbelieve in introducing fancy words just to differentiate.\u201d\n\nDeveloping residences is almost a business imperative,\u00a0but it\u2019s also a natural\nextension: Rosewood has managed apartments at The Carlyle since 2002, and sold\nholiday residences and townhouses from Vancouver to S\u00e3o Paulo to every location\nin Mexico in which it operates. In the past two years, Cheng has announced\nsix\u00a0standalone Rosewood Residences, unaffiliated with any hotel. \u201cWe get a lot\nof customers who say, I want this for\u00a0my home \u2013 this exact design, this exact\ncuration. So\u00a0how do you take that notion and put it in a residence?\u201d\u00a0If\u00a0the\nstarting prices in Beverly Hills of $10mn\u00a0are any indication, they\u2019re\nsucceeding.\n\nSays Cheng: \u201cWe want to make people say when they walk in, \u2018This is a place I\ncan hang out with my friends\u2019\u201d \u00a9 Julien Lienard\n\nCarlyle & Co, the members\u2019 club Cheng launched two years ago, currently has just\none location at present, atop\u00a0the Rosewood Hong Kong \u2013 and she\u2019s keeping schtum\nabout where the next will open.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not about quantity here,\u201d she says. \u201cWith membership, it\u2019s always the\nright location and city. You know the Carlyle \u2013 it has such a rich soul. You\nwalk in and might not feel it\u2019s the grandest hotel ever; there are parts that\nare probably dated, the tables are maybe too close together at Bemelmans [Bar].\nBut there\u2019s a sense of community that\u2019s real. Somehow, it\u2019s kind of a club, even\nthough it\u2019s not.\u201d She \u201ctook the soul of all that\u201d back to Hong Kong, recreating\nan outpost of the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, nightly jazz and all. It still, she says, has a\nwaiting list for membership in the hundreds.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to be growing all at once, it seems to me; but clearly not to Cheng.\n\u201cAll these touch points are opportunities,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of us\nbeing in this business, I think. We can be a platform for connecting people in\ncommunities, and enriching the places we operate in. We can play that role. I\nfind it to be a very meaningful part of what we do.\u201d It has the ring of the note\nshe\u2019d like to end on: very on-message, also like something she really believes,\ndefinitely like something she intends to make happen.\u00a0",

Like Rosewood Hotel Group, which not only operates some of the\nworld\u2019s most exceptional hotels, but does so with a deep-rooted commitment to do\ngood, both for people and the planet.\n\nRosewood Hong Kong.\n\nImage courtesy Rosewood Hotel Group\n\n\nTHIS IS ROSEWOOD HONG KONG\n\nRosewood Hotel Group has achieved a level of global recognition that most\nhospitality brands could only dream of. Last September, when 50 Best (the\norganization behind the prestigious World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants and World\u2019s 50\nBest Bars) unveiled the first-ever World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels ranking, the list\nfeatured three Rosewood hotels. Taking the number two spot globally and\nsimultaneously being named \u201cThe Best Hotel in Asia\u201d was Rosewood Hong Kong, the\nbrand\u2019s ultra-chic flagship property.\n\nSet in the heart of the Victoria Dockside arts and design district, on the\nglittering waterfront in Tsim Sha Tsui, the cooly sophisticated 413-room\nRosewood Hong Kong occupies 43 floors of the Rosewood Tower, a new landmark on\nthe city\u2019s iconic skyline. A major contributor to Tsim Sha Tsui\u2019s growing\nreputation as a burgeoning creative and cultural epicenter, the glamorous\nproperty\u2014home to no fewer than 12 bars and restaurants, as well as the holistic\nAsaya wellness concept, and over 34,000 square feet of meeting and events\nspace\u2014has quickly established itself as a place to see and be seen.\n\nAsaya is Rosewood Hong Kong's holistic wellness concept.\n\nImage courtesy Rosewood Hotel Group\n\nFrom Holt\u2019s Caf\u00e9 with its contemporary take on Hong Kong\u2019s traditional Cha Chaan\nTeng dining culture, to DarkSide, a sophisticated, timeless celebration of rare\naged spirits and classic cocktails complemented by sultry live jazz, and superb\none-star Michelin CHAAT, aptly named after the Hindi word \"to lick\", which will\ntransport you across India with its delectable tasting menus bursting with\nreimagined, elevated authentic flavors, Rosewood Hong Kong has something for\nevery taste.\n\nAdditionally, the 186 ultra-luxury Rosewood Residences have been designed for\nresidents electing short and longer stay rentals, with a private club, along\nwith special services and exclusive amenities.\n\nBlueHouse at Rosewood Hong Kong.\n\nImage courtesy Rosewood Hotel Group\n\n\nBLUHOUSE: A BUSINESS WITH PURPOSE\n\nThen there is BluHouse, with its sun-drenched dining hall that celebrates the\nvibrant spirit of Italy. BluHouse is also Rosewood Hotel Group\u2019s first\nrestaurant inspired by the concept of a business with purpose. As Mehvesh Mumtaz\nAhmed, Rosewood Hotel Group\u2019s Vice President of Social Impact, explains:\n\n\"It\u2019s not lost on us that consumers are prioritizing sustainable brands now more\nthan ever, and we\u2019re happy to be aligned with this growing pool of conscious\ntravelers,\" she says, adding that creating a positive impact for people and the\nplanet has been at the forefront of Rosewood Hotel Group\u2019s operations for years.\nIn 2022, the group rolled out Rosewood Impacts, a framework for delivering on\nthis vision that seeks to empower people across the brand\u2019s ecosystem, with a\nsustainability approach that puts circular hospitality at the core of business\noperations.\n\nAhmed describes Hong Kong as a destination that is both incredibly prosperous\nyet also struggles with issues of economic disparities. Understanding that\ntourism\u2014especially at the luxury level\u2014is a huge driver of revenue for the\ndestination, the team at Rosewood Hong Kong identified an opportunity to bridge\nthis gap and provide direct economic support to underserved communities in its\nneighborhood.\n\nOf the 413 rooms and suites, 80% have views of Hong Kong harbor.\n\nImage courtesy Rosewood Hotel Group\n\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF RESPONSIBLE HIRING PRACTICES\n\n\"Given that responsible hiring practices have been shown to create real,\nsustained equity, a targeted employment program felt like the best way to ensure\nthat we were making a meaningful difference. This was the genesis of BluHouse, a\nrestaurant committed to co-creating neighborhood resilience through donations,\nemployment, and impactful experiences in support of underserved groups in Hong\nKong,\" says Ahmed.\n\nWhen the team began to research the most overlooked groups in Rosewood Hong\nKong\u2019s neighborhood, they discovered that these were mostly people of color:\nrefugees and minorities. They decided to connect with these groups with the help\nof trusted NGO partners, and welcome them into the Rosewood family.\n\n\"Hong Kong has more than 14,000 refugees from all corners of the world who\nremain here for an average of 10+ years before heading to a country that will\ngrant them asylum,\" continues Ahmed. \"During those years, they languish on basic\ngovernment support unless an employer is willing to sponsor a work visa for\nthem. Which few employers do. For us, there was no hesitation.\"\n\nThe waterfront promenade in Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\ngetty\n\n\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR REFUGEES AND MINORITIES\n\nAs part of its mission to support underprivileged local groups, the hotel\ncurrently has three refugees working in BluHouse and three in other departments.\nMeanwhile, BluHouse has pledged 1% of its revenue towards this program and has\nalso launched the BluCup, a sustainable, reusable cup that not only reduces\nwaste but also allows guests to join the journey. Every purchase triggers a\ndonation to NGOs supporting disadvantaged groups in the community.\n\n\"We feel lucky to have some incredible members of this community among our\nranks, who bring not just a great work ethic but compassion and kindness to the\nworkplace,\" says Ahmed, emphasizing that the success of the BluHouse project\ncould well serve as a benchmark for future food and beverage ventures \"with\npurpose\".\n\n\"We want to continue to act as an employer that creates a diverse and inclusive\nenvironment and use our status as a way to help underserved groups seek out\nopportunities that lead to meaningful livelihoods,\" she says, concluding: \"We\nwant to build a future where people and place enrich one another; a future where\nluxury hospitality is a force that benefits local communities and aids in\nhelping them thrive; a future that acknowledges that the success of business and\nsociety is knitted together.\"",

        "content": "For years, Adrian Cheng had all the trappings of a third-generation scion\npreparing to lead one of Hong Kong\u2019s wealthiest clans into a new era. He infused\nhis property projects with art, burnished Tsim Sha Tsui\u2019s waterfront as a\ncultural district and invested in digital tokens.\u00a0\n\nThis month, his heir-apparent status at the\u00a0$26 billion family\u00a0empire was thrown\ninto doubt after his father Henry Cheng said the conglomerate is\u00a0still\nlooking\u00a0for a successor.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still observing but I think it\u2019s not so easy to identify such a person,\u201d he\nsaid in a television interview, adding that the family has a wide range of\noperations and qualified \u201cmembers can be in charge of each business sector. If\nthere\u2019s no family member suitable, we can hire from the outside.\u201d\n\nThe revelation from Hong Kong\u2019s third-richest man raised eyebrows in a city\nall-too familiar with succession battles that often erupt into public view and\noccasionally wind up in court. Former casino baron Stanley Ho and property\ntycoon Lo Ying Shek are just two examples.\n\nHenry\u2019s comments could mean that he hopes to have each family member lead a\nparticular segment, but not necessarily pick one leader for the entire\nbusinesses, said Winnie Peng, director of the Roger King Center for Asian Family\nBusiness and Family Office at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\nShe added that it\u2019s often a process of evolving from a family business to a\nbusiness family.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen families are planning for succession, there could be potential sibling\nrivalry,\u201d Peng said. \u201cThis is something that they have to be really careful\nabout.\u201d But if the family members are harmonious and share the same values, then\nthis problem can be avoided, she said.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, Henry\u2019s close associates didn\u2019t share details of the\ninterview on the family-backed HOY TV with his children before it aired, people\nfamiliar with the matter said, requesting not to be named because the matter is\nprivate. Adrian was aware of the interview and its contents before it was\nbroadcast, a spokesperson said, without providing further details.\u00a0\n\nIt had been widely expected that Adrian, a 44-year-old graduate of Harvard\nUniversity, would take over leadership of the family empire from his father.\u00a0\n\nAdrian is currently chief executive officer of New World Development Co., the\nfamily\u2019s flagship property business; Sonia Cheng, Henry\u2019s 43-year-old daughter,\nmanages the Rosewood hotel and Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd.; and Henry,\n76, controls Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd., the Chengs\u2019 unlisted family\ninvestment vehicle, with other relatives. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises holds major\nstakes in the clan\u2019s main businesses,\u00a0controlling\u00a0New World and the\u00a0Rosewood.\u00a0\n\nAs recently as 2020, Adrian\u2019s representatives were distributing a bio that\ndescribed him as \u201cthe heir to New World Development and Chow Tai Fook\nEnterprises, and the third generation leader of the $20.7 billion empire.\u201d Sonia\nidentified herself as chief executive officer of Rosewood around the same\nperiod.\n\nWhen asked about her father\u2019s remarks during an earnings briefing, Sonia \u2014 also\na Harvard grad \u2014 said her role at the jeweler provides a clear division of work\nwithin the company, and all family members work together for the benefit of the\nfirm. Conroy Cheng, Sonia\u2019s cousin and vice chairman of the jeweler, said\n\u201cthere\u2019s no such thing\u201d when asked about the possibility of family infighting.\nNew World declined to comment. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises didn\u2019t respond to a\nrequest for comment.\n\nThe patriarch\u2019s words matter in a succession process that may soon get under\nway, especially in a society that traditionally favors the eldest son.\u00a0\n\nHenry took over the business from his father Cheng Yu-tung, who built the\nconglomerate spanning shopping malls, casinos, hotels, and jewelry stores across\nHong Kong and mainland China. The group\u2019s holdings are among the signature\nproperties in Hong Kong, from the New World Tower to the Victoria Dockside\ncomplex.\u00a0\n\nThe sprawling empire has generated a fortune for Henry, whose net worth is\nalmost $21 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\u00a0\n\nUnder Adrian, New World has expanded aggressively in China and is working on two\nof the biggest retail developments in Hong Kong, including a $2.6 billion\nmall-office complex next to the airport.\u00a0\n\nThe strategy has come at a cost for New World, driving its debt load higher just\nas interest rates are soaring. The company\u2019s net debt to equity was 94% at the\nend of June, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That compares with 42% at\nrival Henderson Land Development Co., and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.\u2019s 18%.\n\n\u201cNew World\u2019s leverage is particularly high so there are more concerns for the\ncompany,\u201d said Patrick Wong, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWhen the\nmarket sentiment is not good\u201d companies like New World are especially\nvulnerable, he said.\n\nNew World\u2019s stock has tumbled 47% this year to a 20-year low, compared with a\n14% drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. The developer\u2019s $1.3 billion\nperpetual bonds sold in 2019 traded at just 51 cents on the dollar.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s even after the Cheng family investment vehicle stepped in to alleviate\nthe builder\u2019s debt burden. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd. recently bought the\nmajority shares of NWS Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary, generating $2.8 billion for\nNew World.\u00a0\n\nChina\u2019s property meltdown represents another headwind for New World \u2014 and for\nAdrian. Its contracted sales from homes in the mainland accounted for almost\ntwo-thirds of total sales in the 12 months through June. By contrast,\nbillionaire Li Ka-shing\u2019s CK Asset Holdings Ltd. has trimmed its revenue from\nmainland China to just 11%.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWeathering the challenging macro business environment is very important for\nboth New World and Adrian Cheng,\u201d said Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at\nHong Kong-based VL Asset Management. \u201cIf he can resolve the difficulties, it\nwill solidify his position and future as a business leader.\u201d\n\n\nADRIAN\u2019S GAMBIT\n\nAdrian has certainly been on the move, modernizing his retail empire at a time\nwhen traditional malls are under siege. His vision includes building his\nflagship K11 malls into premium destinations with art and culture. He\u2019s bringing\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s first ever\u00a0fashion show\u00a0to Hong Kong this month, and introduced\nAsia\u2019s largest MoMA design store.\n\nHis crown jewel K11 MUSEA\u2019s foot traffic increased 67% in this first-half and\nmall sales increased 84%, the company said.\n\nAdrian\u2019s logic is that the future of retail isn\u2019t just about selling goods, it\u2019s\nabout the experience, especially for the deep-pocketed consumers he\u2019s chasing.\nThe company\u2019s top clients who spend more than HK$300,000 a year contributed\nHK$1.1 billion to sales last fiscal year, and tripled consumption from\npre-pandemic levels, according to a spokesperson.\u00a0\n\nAnd to underscore his legitimacy beyond overseeing money from friends and\nfamily, Adrian\u2019s private investment arm, C Capital, raised more than $250\nmillion for its Private Equity Fund III to back emerging consumer and technology\nfirms.\u00a0\n\nNew World is also selling assets to raise cash and is cutting debt, making\ndeleveraging the priority, Chief Financial Officer Edward Lau said in an\ninterview.\u00a0\n\nThe company plans to dispose of HK$6 billion in non-core assets in the fiscal\nyear through June, after selling HK$38 billion in the last three years. It also\nwill seek joint ventures to develop its 15 million square feet of land in Hong\nKong\u2019s Northern Metropolis to lower costs, while some plots could also be up for\nsale. It announced plans on Nov. 23 to spend as much as $600 million to buy back\nseven of its dollar bonds.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s volatility in the market, whether it\u2019s related to our company or\nnot, we will buy more,\u201d Lau said.\n\nRead more: New World May Only Slightly Cut Debt Cost on Bond Buyback: React\n\nStill, all the challenges facing Adrian are adding heft to his father\u2019s comments\nabout succession in a family where multiple siblings play active roles.\u00a0\n\nSonia sits atop both the hotel business and a publicly traded jewelry unit that\nhas a market value three times higher than New World.\u00a0\n\nTheir brothers Brian and Christopher serve as executive directors of the\nfamily\u2019s infrastructure arm NWS Holdings. Brian also sits on the board of New\nWorld. They also have two half-brothers. Henry\u2019s nephew-in-law, Patrick Tsang,\nserves as chief executive officer of Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s actually very encouraging to siblings other than simply Adrian\nCheng,\u201d Peng said, referring to Henry\u2019s comments. \u201cThey would feel better that\nthe father is quite inclusive to try to encourage them to join the family\u201d\nbusiness, she said.\u00a0\n\nRecommended Newsletter: CEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need\nto know from across the world of business.

Taking the number two spot and earning the distinction of \u201cThe Best\nHotel in Asia\u201d was Rosewood Hong Kong. Rosewood Sao Paulo ranked at number 27,\nwhile Hotel de Crillon in Paris rounded up the list at number 50.\n\nThe achievement is \u201ca huge recognition to the team and all the effort they have\nput into the brand,\u201d reflected Sonia Cheng, CEO of Rosewood Hotel Group. \u201cFor\nthree of our properties to be recognised, and for Rosewood Hong Kong to be\nnumber two in the world, that is a significant recognition.\u201d\n\nCheng, 43, hails from one of Hong Kong\u2019s billionaire family dynasties. Her\ngrandfather, the late Cheng Yu-tung, founded real estate and investment\nconglomerate, New World Development. The elder Cheng\u2019s rags-to-riches story\nbegan when he turned a Macau gold shop into the now renowned Chow Tai Fook\nJewellery chain. His son, and Cheng\u2019s father, Henry Cheng, is now chairman of\nthe businesses.\n\nAfter pursuing a career in banking and finance, Cheng, who graduated from\nHarvard with a major in applied mathematics, joined the family fold at the age\nof 28 to head up its hospitality business. In 2011, New World Hospitality\nacquired Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, then based in Texas, US, for a reported\nUS$229.5 million. Back then, while the Rosewood name was familiar among North\nAmerican travellers, it was not well-known on an international scale.\n\nUnder Cheng\u2019s leadership, Rosewood has since evolved into a global player in the\nluxury hospitality space, with openings in key cities including Beijing, London,\nAbu Dhabi, Munich and more. Its portfolio of 33 one-of-a-kind luxury hotels in\n21 countries also includes legendary properties such as The Carlyle in New York,\nand the Hotel de Crillon in Paris, both of which have undergone a transformation\nunder Rosewood.\n\nThere are currently another 27 hotels in the pipeline, with Cheng describing the\nnext two years as Rosewood\u2019s \u201cpeak opening years\u201d, where it will continue to\nexpand in Europe, Japan, the Middle East, China, Mexico, New Zealand and more.\n\u201cThe next couple of years is really exciting. Key gateway cities have always\nbeen our target, but we also explore new destinations and projects that we think\nfit the Rosewood philosophy. These projects may not be in gateway locations that\ntravellers expect, but I think what travellers are looking for in this day and\nage is for Rosewood to take them on a journey to explore new destinations.\u201d\n\nLink to source\n\nRead the full article at Rosewood Hotel Group",

Among all\ncountries with a total supply of more than 50,000 rooms, Israel, Switzerland,\nGreece, Italy, and France led in RevPAR on an actual basis.

The financing includes the opportunity to expand the\nborrowing capacity up to an aggregate size of $400 million, and there is a\none-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The\nfinancing is fully prepayable without penalty, and the interest rate is based\nupon a pricing grid related to the company's Net Debt to EBITDA that provides\nfor a range of SOFR + 2.35% to 3.10%. Braemar anticipates that the initial\ninterest rate will be SOFR + 2.85%. The use of proceeds for the financing was to\nrepay the mortgage debt associated with the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota, the\nBardessono Hotel and Spa, and the Hotel Yountville, which will serve as the\nborrowing base for the financing.\n\nTPG growth. TPG Hotels & Resorts, Providence, Rhode Island, will manage The\nBlennerhassett Hotel, Parkersburg, West Virginia. The 140-year-old, 84-room\nhistoric property was purchased in 2019 by R&W Hotels, which is owned and\noperated by local Parkersburg businessmen Wayne Waldeck and Lee Eric Rector.\n\nOutrigger finalizes Maui deal.

Las Vegas legend Steve Wynn has agreed to pay a $10 million\nfine and cut ties with the casino business, ending a lengthy legal battle with\nNevada gaming regulators over claims of workplace sexual misconduct. Wynn\nresigned from his namesake gaming company in February 2018 over these\nallegations. Wynn signed a seven-page document on July 17 acknowledging he had\nbeen accused of \u201cfailure to exercise discretion and sound judgment\u201d to prevent\nactions that \u201creflected negatively on the reputation\u201d of Nevada and its gambling\nindustry. Now 81, he lives in Florida and via a statement said he \u201clooks forward\nto moving on to other phases of his life.\u201d The fine is reportedly the largest\never imposed by the commission, second only to a $20 million fine in 2018 to\nWynn Resorts for failing to investigate the sexual misconduct claims made\nagainst Wynn.\n\nNero's Theatre under Four Seasons.

The hotel is expected to be open in time for\nthe Vatican's 2025 Jubilee, when an estimated 30 million people and pilgrims are\nexpected to flock to Rome. Among the discoveries: 10th century glass-colored\ngoblets and pottery pieces that are unusual because so little is known about\nthis 15th century period in Rome. Officials said the portable antiquities would\nbe moved to a museum, while the ruins of the theater structure itself would be\ncovered again after all studies are completed.\n\nSix Japan hotel trades. Tokyo-based Hospitality and Residential REIT Invincible\nInvestment Corp. has acquired six hotels there from U.S. Asset Manager Fortress\nInvestment Group for JPY 57.2 billion.

Declines in the retail, lodging, and multifamily\nrates offset a small increase in industrial loans and a bigger increase for\noffices.\u00a0Office remains the most heavily watched part of the market as firms\nlook to aggressively reduce space. Sublease space is at or near record highs in\nmany markets as demand from big tech firms has eroded sharply.

So, while a good hotel can make you feel as comfortable as\nyou would at home, a great hotel can offer you something even better \u2014 a feeling\nof belonging in a brand-new, upgraded, and wholly unique space. The new Rosewood\nMunich does exactly that.\n\n\u201cMunich hasn\u2019t seen this before \u2014 a hotel with a vibe,\u201d Radha Arora, president\nof Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, told me over cocktails at the hotel\u2019s opening f\u00eate\nin October. The hotel, he added, \u201cspeaks to the community, with all the artists\nwe showcase, it speaks to place. We have great confidence in this location.\u201d\n\nThe Rosewood Munich, as it stands now, is the culmination of a project 10 years\nin the making. And it\u2019s just as spectacular as you\u2019d expect a decade\u2019s worth of\nwork to be.\n\n\nALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS BRAND-NEW ROSEWOOD HOTEL IN MUNICH\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nEvery space, including the lobby, 132 guest rooms, restaurant Brasserie\nCuvilli\u00e9s, and Asaya Spa, is decked out in muted earth tones, light woods, and\npops of royal blues and decadent, emerald green velvet furnishings you simply\ncannot stop running your hands over.\n\nThis includes the hotel\u2019s signature Maximillian Suite, named after a royal\nBavarian family, that sports more than 2,500 square feet of living space,\nincluding a full kitchen and soaking tubs in each bathroom, which starts at\naround USD 25,000 (HKD 195,687) a night. All these glamorous decor touches are\nthanks to Tara Bernerd & Partners, who worked alongside the Munich-based\narchitectural firm Hilmer Sattler to ensure the space honoured its location\nwhile creating the most welcoming (and decadent) space possible.\n\n\u201cRosewood Munich is our first project in Germany with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\nand is a key moment for us,\u201d Bernerd shared in a statement. \u201cWe have sought to\nbring a refined residential style with a contemporary take on Baroque\narchitecture. This elevated sense of sophistication will provide a place for\nlocals and distinguished travellers to come together in this vibrant and\neclectic city.\u201d\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nWhile the Rosewood Munich still has that brand-new hotel smell, it somehow feels\nlived in. It\u2019s massive, yet cosy. Walking through the common spaces, you\u2019re\nbound to find friends, old and new, gathering for tasty chocolates set out on\nthe table, guests reading books while lounging on the plush chairs next to the\npicture windows, and perhaps even a four-legged companion or two laying out as\nif they owned the place.\n\nHowever, there is one spot you may or may not get to see while you\u2019re at the\nhotel \u2014 its ultra-exclusive and downright secretive speakeasy, known as 100B. I\ndon\u2019t want to give away too many details here, as half the fun is finding it for\nyourself. However, I did get a sneak peek at 100B, which is well\nhidden-somewhere near the bar. It\u2019s as sexy a place as they come, with rich, red\nleather furnishings, dim lighting, and some fantastically rare spirits behind\nthe bar, including a few bottles of Pappy Van Winkle that will send any whiskey\nlover into full-on fanfare. Want to get in? Try to make friends with a hotel\nbartender. He or she might reveal the secret code and the location. Just don\u2019t\nbe surprised if they look at you in total bewilderment when you ask about 100B,\nas it truly is meant to stay exclusive.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know about the hotel and my full review of the new\nRosewood Munich.\n\n[myaffiliate type=\u201dnormal\u201d button_name=\u201dShop the best travel experiences here \u201d\nurl=\u201dhttps://experiences.travelandleisureasia.com/\u201d align=\u201dcenter\u201d\nclass=\u201daffiliate-one\u201d\n\n\nTHE ROOMS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThe hotel has 73 spacious guest rooms and 59 suites, including five exclusive\nhouses, which are massive, apartment-style accommodations ideal for big groups\nor extended-stay guests. Entry-level rooms range from EUR 700 (HKD 5,941) \u2013 EUR\n2,750 (HKD 23,342); while suites range from EUR 1,200 (HKD 10,185) \u2013 EUR 4,650\n(HKD 39,469); and houses range from EUR 4,300 (HKD 36,498) \u2013 EUR 35,000 (HKD\n297,081). Every room has a fantastic view of either the Munich city skyline or\nits interior courtyard. Expect bespoke furnishings, minibars filled with local\ntreats, and marble bathrooms with not-to-miss rosemary-infused shampoos that\nwill leave your hair smelling better than ever.\n\n\nTHE SPA\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nThe hotel\u2019s Asaya Spa draws much of its decor and treatment inspiration from its\nalpine surroundings. Here, guests can indulge in holistic treatments using\nproducts by Dr Barbara Sturm, OTO, Ground Wellbeing, and EviDenS de Beaut\u00e9. The\n1,300-square-foot spa includes an indoor pool, dual saunas, steam rooms, and six\ntreatment rooms. I recommend springing for The Aufguss Journey, a 120-minute\ntreatment that uses aromatherapy and happens over three phases \u2014 a body scrub, a\nwrap, and a massage. I loved that the treatment uses a native pine and spruce\nblend for that all-important \u201csense of place\u201d the Rosewood is known for.\n\n\nFOOD AND DRINKS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nRosewood Munich is bringing more fine dining to the city thanks to Cuvilli\u00e9s.\nThe brasserie is open to both guests and locals who wish to come enjoy meals\nbuilt around ingredients sourced from the region, including Helmut Schlader\nAlpine caviar, Wagyu beef from Tegernsee, and lamb from a breeder in Jochberg,\nlocated just two hours away. The menu highlights include bites of steckerlfisch\n(grilled fish) alongside spinach dumplings, and, of course, wiener schnitzel.\nBut please don\u2019t overlook the Celeriac Cream Soup as an appetiser. Made with\ntruffle, spices, and white balsamic, it\u2019s the perfect start to a hearty meal.\n\nFollowing your last bite, make your way to Bar Montez, where you can not only\nget a craft cocktail, wine, or local beer, but you can also take in live music\nby jazz musicians strumming in the corner.\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\nACTIVITIES AND EXPERIENCES\n\nThere is a dedicated concierge team at the hotel to assist guests in planning a\nbespoke itinerary. The team can help book exclusive guided tours through local\nmuseums like the Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art (MUCA), as well as visits\nto historic destinations like the Nymphenburg Palace or more adrenaline-filled\nactivities like BMW Driving Tours.\n\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY OFFERINGS\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Rosewood Munich\n\nKids are also more than welcome at the hotel. The concierge team is happy to\ncreate experiences just for them, including local cooking classes and arts and\ncrafts sessions. The hotel is also happy to assist in babysitting services so\nparents can head out for a night on the town sans kids.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\nThe Rosewood Munich is ADA compliant, offering three ADA-compliant rooms, and\nhas a ground-floor elevator to allow easy access in and out of the building. As\nfor sustainability, during the hotel\u2019s construction, the team recycled 96\npercent of the materials from the demolition to use in the new space, including\n1,500 tons of metal, cables, copper pipes, reinforced concrete, and glass. This\nhotel, like other Rosewood properties, is in line with Rosewood\u2019s principle of\n\u201cRelationship Hospitality,\u201d meaning it has a close relationship with local\nsuppliers to reduce environmental demands on the supply chain.

        "content": "When you hear travel critics say that the big brands like Marriott and Hilton\ndon't really know how to run luxury hotels, it's probably because those critics\nhave stayed at a property affiliated with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts.\n\nThe Texas-originating (the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas was the\ncompany's first hotel) and now Hong Kong-based luxury hotel brand was born of\nthe idea of creating properties with residential touches and hyperattentive\nservice.\n\nRosewood is also known for designing hotels that become landmarks in the cities\nin which they operate: The Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel in New York City is\nsynonymous with legendary jazz and equally as legendary mixology. Rosewood Hong\nKong's perch on Victoria Harbour is home to some of the city's most renowned\npower dining spots as well as an incubator of sorts of the brand's newer\nmembership club, Carlyle & Co., as well as a beefed-up city version of\nRosewood's Asaya spa concept.\n\nExpect more of this kind of luxurious localization to spread around the world,\nas the company's expansion streak is expected to build over the next few years\nto the highest growth seen in the company's 44-year history.\n\n\"As we continue to add new properties and as we continue to find new locations,\nthat's the first thing we look at,\" Radha Arora, Rosewood's president and\nco-chief development officer, said. \"Is this property really emblematic of that\nlocation?\"\n\nRelated: What it's like staying at the Rosewood Baha Mar\n\nRosewood currently has 32 hotels across its portfolio but is on track to more\nthan double that number in coming years. Rosewood Munich opened this month in\nGermany but will gain several new siblings next year with the expected arrivals\nof Rosewood Amsterdam, Rosewood Schloss Fuschl in Austria, Rosewood Miyakojima\nin Japan and Rosewood Doha.\n\nProperties in Milan, Mexico City, Rome, Vietnam, Venice and Greece as well as a\nsecond London hotel, are slated beyond those 2024 openings.\n\n\"[2025] is going to be one of those years where we're going to be probably\nopening the most properties we've ever opened in one particular year,\" Arora\nsaid.\n\nDaily Newsletter\n\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\n\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals\nfrom TPG\u2019s experts\n\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to\nour Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You\nmay unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\nTHINKING LIKE A LOCAL\n\nDon't take the accelerating growth as a sign the company is moving into a more\ncookie-cutter design phase where hotels can be replicated and built quickly.\nArora noted the company still goes to great lengths to have a deliberative\ndevelopment process so that hotels resemble the surrounding community and are a\nplace where locals want to socialize.\n\nThe Mansion at Turtle Creek, a manor house-style hotel nestled within a\nresidential Dallas neighborhood, established the localized flourishes that\nRosewood is still known for decades later. The brand specifically chose Rosewood\nLondon's location near Covent Garden because it wasn't in the usual bastion of\nultraluxury hotels in the city like Mayfair or Knightsbridge, Arora said.\n\nParis' Hotel de Crillon, a Rosewood Hotel is supposed to feel like a living room\nof \"old apartments that, over the years, you've collected pieces and accessories\nwhile you've been living in Paris, home to the fashionistas,\" he added.\n\nThe hyperlocalization and attention to detail appear to be working and are even\na business advantage in wooing both guests and deals for more hotels. Hotel de\nCrillon saw its highest-ever occupancy and demand levels this year, Arora said.\nFurther, room nights booked at Rosewood Bangkok are up 153% from a year ago\nwhile Rosewood Phuket is up 29%.\n\n\"We don't build properties for tourists. We build properties for locals, first\nand foremost, and make sure that we engage ourselves with the local partners,\"\nArora said. \"That comes to food, amenities and anything that comes to\npunctuating a property.\"\n\nBuild for the locals, and the out-of-towners will follow their lead, the\nthinking goes.\n\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR ROSEWOOD\n\nRosewood's growth trajectory has also seen the company expand into newer\nventures under the direction of Sonia Cheng, the company's CEO.\n\nThe growth of residential components at Rosewood properties, as well as\nstand-alone Rosewood-branded residential developments, is on the rise. As of\nthis year, half of the company's existing hotel portfolio, as well as its\ndevelopment pipeline, features a residential component. There are also six\nstand-alone residential projects in various stages of development in markets\nlike Beverly Hills, California, and South Florida.\n\n\"We were hesitant at first, but we realized that people want a piece of Rosewood\nas their home,\" Arora said with a laugh.\n\nCarlyle & Co., a membership club paying homage to the Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel\nin New York City, is located within the same tower as Rosewood Hong Kong. The\nself-described \"modern, progressive\" club is meant to be more of an inclusive\nspace than other private Hong Kong clubs, and Rosewood leadership maintains it's\na place where character and personality trump what one does for a living. There\nare plans to expand Carlyle & Co. to select global destinations.\n\nAsaya, Rosewood's wellness offering, is in six hotels \u2014 including Guangzhou,\nHong Kong, Vienna and Phuket \u2014 with plans for continued expansion. Asaya is more\nof an immersive experience than a usual hotel spa, with well-being classes,\ntreatments, nutritionists and even overnight Asaya Lodges for \"contemplative,\nregenerative stays\" offered to coincide with a treatment program that fits the\nguest.\n\nNew World Hotels & Resorts, Rosewood Hotel Group's upper-upscale brand, is a nod\nto the Hong Kong company that acquired Rosewood when it was still a privately\nheld Texas company. The Asia-focused brand currently has 15 hotels in its\nportfolio, with three more slated to open by the end of 2023 and an additional\ntwo opening next year.\n\n\"Growing new brands and business ventures will further position us as a brand of\nchoice for modern luxury consumers in the future,\" Arora said.\n\n\nBUSINESS AND INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\n\nWith global macroeconomic conditions a little murky at the moment, it's\nreasonable to wonder if there's a limit to the runway for all the growth in\nultraluxury hotels. Sure, customers in this social strata tend to be a little\nrecession-proof, but high interest rates make expansion more difficult amid\nrising construction costs.\n\nWhile Arora is mindful of the economy, he also sees opportunity and advantage\nwith Rosewood being a smaller brand.\n\n\"There is always going to be some kind of cycle. There are always going to be\nsome challenges,\" he said before adding: \"We mitigate some of that risk because\nwe are going to some parts of the world that are going to be still seen as a\nsafe haven to go to, where you know what you're going to get.\"\n\nThe Rosewood executive emphasized there is still \"incredibly high demand\" for\nultraluxury and that consumers prefer experiences like travel. Making sure the\noverall offerings at Rosewood remain elevated is crucial to making sure that\ndemand momentum remains at its lofty peak.\n\n\"We continue to remain confident in the industry's long-term health and continue\nto invest in new guest experiences,\" Arora said. \"We don't just build hotels. We\nbuild destinations.\"\n\nRelated reading:\n\n * The best hotel credit cards\n * Get free breakfast, upgrades and more with the Amex Fine Hotels + Resorts\n   program\n * The best hotel rewards programs in the world\n * The best premium credit cards: A side-by-side comparison\n\nEditorial disclaimer: Opinions expressed here are the author\u2019s alone, not those\nof any bank, credit card issuer, airline or hotel chain, and have not been\nreviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.",

        "content": "HOTELS Magazine\u2019s 2024 Hoteliers of the World are recognized as two of the\npreeminent leaders in the luxury hotel space, both parts of companies that are\ntime-tested luxury groups, welcoming demanding, affluent guests and developing\nsome of the finest hotels in the world.\n\nBoth are known for their attention to detail and composure in even the most\ndemanding of situations\u2014no matter what comes their way. These are just two of\nthe many reasons why they were selected for this year\u2019s awards and, as proof,\nare admired by their peers; many of which supported their candidacy for this\nyear\u2019s awards.\n\nToday, we reveal our other awardee: Radha Arora, president of Rosewood Hotels &\nResorts. We put his life and career story in the frame below. We hope you enjoy\nit.\n\nBoth he and fellow winner, Sandeep Bhalla of The Connaught, are featured in\nprint in our forthcoming March/April issue of HOTELS Magazine.\u00a0\n\nWe, and the collective hospitality industry, congratulate the winners.\u00a0\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadha Arora can rationalize any trip to Paris. On a January afternoon, the\npresident of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\nis at H\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel, a designated Palace-grade hotel in the\n8th arrondissement that\u2019s hosted real-life royalty and the fictional kind: the\nprotagonist of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d composes letters from the\nhotel lobby.\n\nOn this particular day, Arora, a Los Angeles resident, is in Paris for work,\nthough the City of Light isn\u2019t why. Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, the luxury hotel\nmanagement arm of Hong Kong-based Rosewood Hotel Group, is opening the\nRosewood Schloss Fuschl, close to Salzburg, Austria, later this year and though\nRosewood also has a hotel in Vienna, Arora is working out of Paris, ensconced in\nthe landmark Crillon. Paris for any occasion.\n\nThe city and the hotel mean more to Arora than just plain work stopovers; they\nboth played pivotal roles in Arora\u2019s upbringing as the son of a foreign service\nworker. \u201cIt\u2019s a great love affair I have with the city,\u201d he said, and for good\nreason. Arora may have a 40-plus-year career in the hotel industry, but one\ncould argue he\u2019s been in it his whole life. Travel is requisite for someone\nworking in the foreign service and when his father received his first posting\nabroad in Moscow, the entire family accompanied him from Arora\u2019s birthplace of\nNew Delhi.\n\nPrior to Russia came a stop in London, where the family stayed at the Strand\nPalace, just across the way from one of the world\u2019s iconic hotels, The Savoy,\nwhich, among other London hospitality institutions, Arora refers to as a paragon\nof hotel virtue.\n\nRadha Arora is president of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. He joined the company 13\nyears ago after learning the luxury ropes with Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts.\n\nAfter Russia came Paris, where, by pure coincidence, the family lived in the\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon, which opened as a hotel in 1909, but stood as a building since\n1758\u2014in 1793, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were guillotined in the\nPlace de la Concorde directly in front of it. It\u2019s a rich, even macabre history.\n\nIt was the 60s when his love affair with the hotel industry coalesced. How could\nit not when you are a real-life Eloise? \u201cLiving in hotels, being surrounded by\nand building relationships with the housekeepers, the room-service staff, the\nbellman, the concierge, front desk\u2014that desire to be around people that are so\ncaring and nurturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were my formative years.\u201d\n\nIt was precisely those years that led him to a career in hospitality because\ntradition did not. It\u2019s typical Indian culture to strive to become a lawyer, a\ndoctor, a financier, but \u201cI wanted to be a hotelier,\u201d Arora said, adding that,\nat one point, dentistry was in the cards. Unlike a film or novel, there was no\npaternal pushback. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018You\u2019ve lived in hotels, you love hotels, you\nlove the smell of a hotel, it is all you talk about.\u2019 That was it. I went with\nhospitality.\u201d\n\nH\u00f4tel de Crillon, A Rosewood Hotel in Paris, is a Palace-grade hotel and a\nproperty that Arora once lived in as a boy.\n\n\nON THE WAY UP\n\nArora studied hospitality in school, but his career journey didn\u2019t start until\nthe 1980s, with his first hotel job in London, as a night receptionist at the\nInn on the Park London, which later became a Four Seasons hotel after its owners\ntook the advice of a little- known Canadian hotelier named Isadore Sharp. (Arora\nrefers to him as the god of hospitality.) It was a pivotal moment for Four\nSeasons because it was its first hotel outside Canada.\n\nFour Seasons had a profound impact on Arora. The company now has more than 120\nhotels worldwide, but back then, there were only a handful, and most were in\nCanada. \u201cLondon was a hallmark of their success,\u201d Arora said, as transatlantic\ntravel boomed, spurred by the likes of the Concorde, which allowed the affluent\nto be on Broadway one night and the West End the next. For two years he was at\nthe hotel, doing the income audit, checking in guests and \u201cI loved it,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is no shortage of luxury hotels in London and there is no more effective\nway to learn the ropes than by immersing oneself in the culture. That\u2019s what\nArora did. He worked at small luxury hotels, like DUKES London in St. James\u2019s;\nhe worked at large luxury hotels, such as the InterContinental London Park Lane;\nand along the way, he picked up experience in all the varied disciplines\u2014from\nfront-of-the-house guest-facing interactions to back-of-the-house accounting,\nArora was front and center on his career arc, soaking it all in. \u201cI just wanted\nto work in great hotels,\u201d Arora said.\n\nThe lobby of The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel in New York\u2019s Upper East SIde.\n\nHe eventually became hotel manager of the famed Ritz London, where he remained\nfor seven years, a stint that included many chance meetings with the likes of\nPrincess Diana, who had a friend living in the hotel. Arora called the Princess\none of the most disarming people he\u2019d ever encountered. \u201cEverybody felt\nconnected to her,\u201d he said. And while Princess Diana was swarmed wherever she\nwent in public, Arora says that the biggest luxury anyone can have of her ilk,\nwithin a luxury hotel, is anonymity.\n\nArora\u2019s connection to London ended when the siren call of Four Seasons beckoned\nhim back. He returned to the company in 1994 and was with them for the next 17\nyears. He felt \u201cat home\u201d with Four Seasons and wanted out of London.\n\nArora took posts from Toronto to Hawaii and even for a time back in his home\ncountry, working in Goa, India. His last position with Four Seasons was one of\nthe most coveted jobs in hospitality: regional vice president and GM of the\nBeverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel, where he stayed for seven years. He\ncalls Los Angeles home today.\n\nIt was that post with Four Seasons that directly led to what is now a\n13-year-and-still-counting career with Rosewood Hotels & Resorts. The Beverly\nWilshire might have been managed by Four Seasons, but it was owned by the Cheng\nfamily of Hong Kong, which, in 2011, acquired a portfolio of Rosewood-managed\nproperties from Maritz, Wolff & Co., five total, including The Carlyle, a\nRosewood Hotel, in New York, and Rosewood Little Dix Bay Resort in the British\nVirgin Islands. At the time of the transaction, the Cheng family stated that\n\u201cRosewood will be positioned for substantially accelerated global growth.\u201d\n\nRosewood Munich is housed in two restored historic buildings\u2014the former State\nBank of Bavaria headquarters and the adjacent Palais Neuhaus-Preysing\naristocratic residence.\n\n\nCOMING UP ROSES\n\nSome 13 years later, Rosewood, under the stewardship of the Cheng family and its\nscion/ CEO, Sonia Cheng, have grown the portfolio to 33 hotels operating and a\nslew more on the way, including a prospective seven more hotels in Greater China\nand seven more in Europe, which includes the The Chancery Rosewood in London,\nslated to open in 2025, and housed in the former U.S. Embassy on Grosvenor\nSquare. Arora calls it an emblem of the Rosewood brand.\n\nRosewood is also opening hotels in destinations beyond what would be considered\nthe norm. This year, it will open Rosewood Miyakojima in Japan, \u201ca destination\nthat our clients would not normally have ever dreamed of,\u201d Arora said.\n\nHe\u2019s been along for the entire ride. The Cheng family recognized greatness in\nArora by his successes in the U.S.\u2014 including the Beverly Wilshire, he had eight\nother hotels under his purview. The idea around Rosewood\u2014and qualified in the\ncompany statement when it acquired the company\u2014was to scale it up, but in a\nmanner that still allowed it to retain its almost provincial charm.\n\nBack in 2011, Sonia Cheng, Arora remembered, referred to Rosewood as a gentle\ngiant that needed to be awakened, a diamond in the rough that just needed some\nbuffing. Arora refers to the 43-year-old Cheng as his \u201cfountain of youth\u201d and\nhis best friend.\n\nWith a startup company mentality, the idea was to expand the brand globally, but\nin a manner where the culture was not bastardized. \u201cEach one of our properties\nis unique, distinct to its culture. That\u2019s what Rosewood is,\u201d Arora said.\nConsider The Carlyle, one of New York\u2019s famed hotels that shares the\nneighborhood with other celebrated hotels. Talk about unique: the hotel\u2019s\nBemelmans Bar features wall murals by Ludwig Bemelmans, the creator of the\nclassic Madeline children\u2019s books, while Woody Allen used to play clarinet with\nhis jazz band on Monday nights in Caf\u00e9 Carlyle. It\u2019s even appeared in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex\n& The City.\u201d Of the hotel, Arora said, \u201cWhen you create a property where you go\nto a city to the hotel versus for the city itself, you know you have a winner.\nIt\u2019s one of those properties where when you walk in you get goosebumps.\u201d\n\nA marbled bathroom at Rosewood Hong Kong, which soars over Victoria Harbour.\n\nThe hotel recently finished off a decade-in-the- making renovation that was\npainstakingly deliberate and meticulous to preserve the hotel\u2019s patina and\ncontinue its legacy. Arora said the older Rosewood properties, from The Caryle\nto Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, act as signposts for the newer\nRosewood properties to come.\n\nRosewood now has a handful of owned properties that Arora calls the linchpins,\nwhich, he says, act almost as showrooms. Now, the idea is to expand through an\nasset-light model, partnering with people who want a piece of Rosewood in their\nportfolio, maybe even more so for the prestige, rather than the returns. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot your typical institutional partner,\u201d Arora said.\n\nPart of Arora\u2019s remit is to strike and nurture these deals, to grow the Rosewood\nbrand by working in tandem with partners to achieve the best results, which is\nwhy Arora keeps a frenzied travel schedule. Arora favors a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\nconversation over a Zoom call. In October 2023, Town & Country published an\narticle titled: \u201cRadha Arora Shares His Favorites for Being at Home or Away.\u201d\nExpectedly, Bose QuietComfort Headphones were cited; surprisingly, were\nBlackwing pencils, which he wears down to the nub: \u201cWe\u2019re in the aesthetics\nbusiness; I work with great designers and architects, and I\u2019ve seen them use\nthese pencils, so when I have one, I feel like I, too, can contribute in some\nway,\u201d he told Town & Country.\n\nArora has contributed in many ways, but it\u2019s not just the contributions he\u2019s\nmade to propel the business, it\u2019s the contributions he\u2019s made to those around\nhim. \u201cIt\u2019s being respectful of others,\u201d Arora said. \u201cHumanity is what our\nindustry is all about. If you endorse the culture through the way you speak to\nsomebody else, then everything else pales.\u201d\n\nPassionate is how Arora believes others see him. Passionate about the way he\ngoes about his business and in his daily relationships. \u201cThis is just who I am,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIt\u2019s about loyalty to our partners and to our teams. When you have\nthis culture, where you create this sense of pride, at every level, that is\nimpenetrable, and it propagates creativity.\u201d\n\nRosewood Mayakoba in Mexico\u2019s Riviera Maya.\n\nIt\u2019s taken time to grow the Rosewood brand to be a powerhouse, standing shoulder\nto shoulder with the likes of Ritz-Carlton and Arora\u2019s old outfit, Four Seasons.\nIt wasn\u2019t David slinging Goliath, but it wasn\u2019t easy; it took time and it took\nconvincing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many different luxury players,\u201d Arora said. Consider H\u00f4tel de\nCrillon. It\u2019s owned by a Saudi Arabian prince, but it took some time coaxing him\nthat Rosewood was the right partner to operate the hotel. \u201cHe\u2019d ask us, \u2018Why\nRosewood? You have no properties in Europe. No infrastructure.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer seems easy but it\u2019s hard to execute on. What it really is, is a\npromise, an assurance of uniqueness and mystique, Arora said. His pitch: \u201cWe are\na well-known brand in the U.S. that will continue to evolve in Europe. You need\nto trust us with this passion and desire. We\u2019ll work on it personally.\u201d\n\nIt happened. \u201cTwelve years later, partners come to us,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe\u2019re very\nfortunate to be in the position to have created this appealing brand.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s had a big hand in it, and Arora says that his job today is to preserve the\nbrand and its culture.\n\nThirteen years in with Rosewood, Arora doesn\u2019t have any plans to go anywhere\nsoon. Besides, he said, his boss wouldn\u2019t allow it. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not going\nanywhere,\u2019\u201d Cheng has told him.\n\nHe\u2019s also in no hurry to be anywhere else. \u201cWhy would I want to? Every day is a\nunique day.\u201d",

        "content": "Following the 2023 announcement of its sustainability and social impact roadmap\nRosewood Impacts, Rosewood Hotel Group today unveils the Impact Trailblazers,\nsix properties who are upleveling the portfolio\u2019s sustainability and social\nresponsibility successes and ambitions. The Impact Trailblazers, which include\nRosewood Hong Kong, Rosewood Baha Mar, Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo, Rosewood Phnom Penh,\nRosewood Mayakoba, and Rosewood Phuket, are leading the charge towards creating\na future where people and place enrich one another, and subsequently setting a\nhigher standard for their sister properties as well as the hospitality industry\nat large. Additive to several targets that are shared by all 48 Rosewood Hotel\nGroup properties, the Impact Trailblazers have committed to achieving at least\none of six stretch goals by 2025, an exercise that will ultimately strengthen\nthe ever-evolving Impacts roadmap through the integration of best practices and\nlessons learned. Focused on the most consequential methods for achieving\npositive environmental and social impact, the stretch goals include:\n\n * 100% elimination of single-use plastics in both front and back of house\n * 100% carbon neutrality\n * 90% waste diversion\n * Local sourcing of 70% of produce and protein\n * Development of minimum one meaningful and long-term community partnership\n * Transformation of minimum one of the hotel\u2019s restaurants into a \u201cbusiness\n   with a purpose\u201d\n\nCentral to Rosewood\u2019s ethos and brand identity, sustainability and social impact\ninitiatives are not mandates but core pillars of each property experience.\nThrough every detail \u2014from eco-conscious culinary creations and educational\nguest programming, to sustainable design elements alongside those that celebrate\nlocal heritage and artistry \u2014every Rosewood hotel and resort embodies a\ncommitment to the planet (Rosewood Sustains) and its people (Rosewood Empowers).\nThe Impact Trailblazers shine as beacons of how luxury and responsibility can\ncoalesce, and how the most elevated experience is the one that makes a positive\ndifference in the world. Through their efforts, they are sculpting the blueprint\nfor the brand\u2019s future, showcasing how a commitment to innovation and\ncollaborative learning can pave the way for groundbreaking achievements in\ncircular hospitality and community empowerment.\n\n> Rosewood Impacts has always been about recognizing not only what we should and\n> can be doing now, but also how we can continue to push ourselves towards\n> better solutions for the future. The Impact Trailblazers are critical to this\n> mission, with ambitions going above and beyond our current sustainability and\n> social impact goals. These six hotels and resorts perfectly embody the\n> direction we are moving in, a direction where delivering positive impact is\n> part of our business DNA. Their transparency and willingness to share both\n> their successes and lessons learned will be invaluable to our objective of\n> creating a new reality where luxury and positive impact are synonymous. They\n> are truly blazing a trail in creating meaningful, enriching connections with\n> their guests, communities, associates, and the places where they\u2019re\n> located.\u00a0Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed, Vice President of Social Impact at Rosewood\n> Hotel Group\n\n\nA CELEBRATION OF BRAZIL\u2019S BEGINNINGS AND FUTURE IN S\u00c3O PAULO\n\nRosewood S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s stretch goals as an Impact Trailblazer are 90% waste\ndiversion (achieved in 2023), 100% elimination of single-use plastics in both\nfront and back of house, 70% of produce and protein sourced locally, and 100%\ncarbon neutrality.\n\nToday, the hotel operates on 100% renewable energy and is almost zero waste,\nwhile its commitment to giving back to its home of Brazil, rather than depleting\nit, is further evidenced in its people-first approach. In just two years since\nopening, Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo has played a pivotal role in boosting local\nbusinesses, rescuing ancestral traditions, and reducing inequalities, with over\n45% of Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s workforce having been hired from underserved groups.\n\n\nMEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS IN PHUKET, THAILAND\n\nMore than just a picturesque retreat, Rosewood Phuket is an epicenter of\nenvironmental sustainability and community empowerment. The resort\u2019s stretch\ngoals as an Impact Trailblazer are 70% of produce and protein sourced locally\n(achieved in 2023), development of a meaningful long-term community investment\n(achieved in 2024), 100% elimination of single-use plastics in both front and\nback of house, and transformation of one restaurant concept into a business with\npurpose.\n\nThe resort was one of Thailand's first to earn LEED Gold Certification and today\nhouses the largest solar energy system of any property in Phuket, as well as\ncomprehensive recycling and wastewater treatment plants. Its culinary program is\nan exemplar of how gastronomy can be used as a tool to protect precious\nresources while also championing indigenous practices. Its signature restaurant\nTa Khai, which is targeted to transform as a business with purpose by end of\n2024, is helmed by local couple Uncle Nun and Aunt Yai and sources 100% of\ningredients locally, with many coming from Ta Khai\u2019s own organic herb and\nvegetable garden.\n\n\nBUILDING BRIGHT FUTURES IN RIVIERA MAYA, MEXICO\n\nRosewood Empowers at its best is Rosewood Mayakoba\u2019s work with Centro Educativo\nK\u2019iin Beh, a non-profit school in the Riviera Maya. With a mission to support\nnot only the hotel associates who need adequate schooling for their children but\nalso the larger community, the resort\u2019s leaders raised the resources required to\nreopen the school in 2017, after several challenges forced the original school\nto shutter. Today, the school welcomes over 450 students, all of whom receive\neconomic support for tuition and supplies funded by the Rosewood Mayakoba\ncommunity. Supplementing the contributions of the resort\u2019s leadership, guests\nare brought into the journey through a special volunteer and donation program,\n\u201cPadrino,\u201d that ensures the continued development of the students.\n\nRosewood Mayakoba\u2019s stretch goals as an Impact Trailblazer are development of a\nmeaningful long-term community investment, (achieved through its work with\nCentro Educativo K\u2019iin Beh) and transformation of one restaurant concept into a\nbusiness with purpose by end of 2024.\n\n\nUPHOLDING AND HONORING TRADITIONS IN PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA\n\nWith a goal of celebrating both the Cambodian capital\u2019s longstanding cultural\ntraditions as well as its incredible evolution in recent years, Rosewood Phnom\nPenh\u2019s Impacts mission prioritizes partnerships that uplift local livelihoods\nand care for the environment. The property\u2019s stretch goals as an Impact\nTrailblazer are 90% waste diversion (achieved in 2023), 100% elimination of\nsingle-use plastics in both front and back of house, and development of a\nmeaningful long-term community investment by end of year 2024. Among the\nproperty\u2019s most impactful community partnerships is that with Phare Ponleu\nSelpak, a local non-profit that offers artistic and vocational training to\nCambodian youth.\n\n\nCHAMPIONING CORAL CONSERVATION IN NASSAU, THE BAHAMAS\n\nGiven that 95% of The Bahamas\u2019 territory is underwater and that the sea has long\nshaped life for Bahamian people, Rosewood Baha Mar is focused on the protecting\nits surrounding waters and championing coral reef conservation. In partnership\nwith the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation (BREEF), the resort\noffers immersive educational experiences at the Coral Reef Sculpture Garden\u2014the\nworld\u2019s largest underwater sculpture and living art gallery created by local\nvisionaries.

        "content": "The formula for luxury hotels has typically had two key ingredients. First,\nchoose locations in the districts where the elite live. Second, focus on\nhigh-touch services encouraging guests to linger, and spend, at the property.\n\nBut Rosewood Hotels & Resorts has taken somewhat alternative approaches when it\ncreated the 30 luxury hotels it operates today \u2014 and as it builds the 25 luxury\nhotels it has in the pipeline. Its strategy responds to shifts in consumer\ntastes.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s client is looking for an immersive, stand-out experience,\u201d said Radha\nArora, president and co-chief development officer. \u201cGone are the days when you\ngo and build right smack in the middle of the obvious epicenter of fashion,\nshopping, or nightlife.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Rosewood Hotel Group does broadly target major tourist destinations.\nNext year, the brand plans to open Rosewood Munich, the brand\u2019s first property\nin Germany, and Rosewood Schloss Fuschl, the group\u2019s second property in Austria.\nIn 2024, Rosewood Rome aims to debut. In 2025, Rosewood Milan and Rosewood Hotel\nBauer near Venice are slated to open. The company also intends to expand in\nAsia, with nine announced openings, and in Latin America, where it debuted\nRosewood S\u00e3o Paulo this year. It\u2019s also growing a branded residential offering\nworldwide.\n\n\nGEOGRAPHIC ARBITRAGE AND THE NEW LUXURY\n\nBut the difference is in the nuance. The conventional wisdom in building luxury\nhotels has been to go to the traditionally most desirable neighborhoods in\npopular destinations because being seen by the right people is often what guests\nwant most. Yet Rosewood often takes a contrarian approach.\n\nWhen it opened in London, for example, it took on a property in \u201cthe City,\u201d or\nfinancial district, rather than a district like Mayfair or Knightsbridge. The\nbrand bet that its core customer, the next-generation elite, would put an\nespecially high value on memorable experiences, which it believed the character\nof the building lent itself to creating.\n\nA flamboyantly decorated, Edwardian-era insurance office was reconfigured as\nRosewood London. Its central carriageway entrance is where the gates open up and\ntraditionally glad staff welcome guests to enter through doors that look like\nthe front door to number 10 Downing Street.\n\n\u201cCreating the sense you\u2019re arriving into a manor or estate in an intimate way\nlike we did there isn\u2019t possible to do elsewhere in central London,\u201d Arora said.\n\n\nOFF-CENTER TARGETS\n\nAs money earmarked to chase high-end real estate assets expands, targets can\nbecome elusive. Part of the Rosewood formula has been finding properties away\nfrom tourist epicenters that can be converted in a lightweight way and can drive\nhigh average daily rates under the Rosewood brand.\n\nA case in point: Creating Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco involved transforming a\nproperty that wasn\u2019t located in one of Tuscany\u2019s most sought-after areas.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t capital intensive because the project was already built,\u201d Arora said.\n\u201cThe Cheng family did take 50 percent ownership at first but then sold that at a\ngood price, and the project didn\u2019t need any capital injection. All it needed was\nthe power of the brand. When we took over Castiglion del Bosco, within the first\ndays we were almost $2 million, I mean, \u20ac2 million, up on what the property had\nbeen generating before.\u201d\n\nIn Saint Barts, the group worked with real estate mogul David Bonderman who was\nthen the owner of Le Guanahani, located on the less visited northern side of the\nisland. Four years of renovations on the three-decade-old family resort\ntransformed it into Rosewood Le Guanahani.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the revenues in the festive season to be 70 percent higher than\nbefore the property was branded Rosewood,\u201d Arora said.\n\nBy choosing locations that haven\u2019t yet been dominated by the scenesters,\nRosewood has a shot at creating the new local scene while also working with\ncapital partners to buy buildings at relatively cheaper prices than properties\nin more central locations.\n\n\u201cIf you take Rosewood Mayakoba, for instance, there was nothing there in that\npart of the Riviera in the luxury end,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe built and it became the\ndestination.\u201d\n\n\nLUXURY LAND GRAB\n\nCreating anything in famously expensive cities such as Hong Kong, London, or New\nYork will involve expense. But Rosewood tries to find undervalued assets to give\nit a margin cushion after revitalization. Its developers divide and conquer\npotential luxury travel fiefdoms.\n\nTo encourage repeat visits by past customers, which is cheaper than acquiring\nnew guests, the company believes building a network of properties that are all\ndistinctive creates a virtuous cycle of surprise and delight.\n\nA Rosewood customer that liked staying in a hale, or a glamorous beach bungalow\nin Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort (which aims to open on the big\nisland in summer 2023), may like the contrast with the very urban and old-school\nRosewood Vienna, which has only 99 guest rooms and suites in a residential-style\nAustrian neighborhood.\n\nThe Vienna property has furniture meant to evoke past local aesthetics, such as\nthe Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte style at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n\u201cIn choosing the pieces of furniture for Vienna, we had a thoughtful designer\nwork with local partners and the ownership to make sure we curated something\nmindful of what the returns would be insofar as revenues are concerned after\neffectively attracting a clientele that could support the desire rate,\u201d Arora\nsaid.\n\nA representation of the planned Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort. Source:\nRosewood.\n\n\nCREATING OFF-PROPERTY EXPERIENCES\n\nMost of Rosewood\u2019s customers are leisure travelers who care more about the\nexperiential aspect of trips than business travelers ordinarily do.\nHigh-net-worth travelers make up the most profitable segment of its customer\ndatabase. Many of these travelers seek \u201cthe new luxury\u201d defined more by\nexperiences than showing off status symbols and checking boxes on seeing\nparticular sights.\n\nOne of Rosewood\u2019s calling cards is having staff talk to guests and offering to\ninvent relevant, bespoke experiences for them. If guests are foodies, it might\npropose a multi-day excursion to Oaxaca, Mexico, with Rosewood staff guiding an\nexploration of the food scene \u2014 even though Rosewood doesn\u2019t have a property\nthere.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just arrange it,\u201d Arora said. \u201cWe will go with you. We\u2019re not just\nselling someone else\u2019s private tours. We want to help like-minded guests really\nget to know each other, so we have a small nucleus of a client database that\u2019s\nbecome friends through Rosewood experiences.\u201d\n\nRosewood S\u00e3o Paulo opened this year. Source: Rosewood.\n\n\nEXPANDING WORLDWIDE\n\nLike many China-based companies, Rosewood is part of a conglomerate, New World,\nwith interests in multiple sectors. Rosewood Hotels Group is led by CEO Sonia\nCheng, a member of the billionaire Cheng family that runs parent conglomerate\nNew World.\n\nIn the 2021 fiscal year, the hotel operations segment of New World reported\nrevenue of approximately $100 million (807.6 million Hong Kong Dollars), which\naccounted for 1.2 percent of the conglomerate\u2019s revenue.\n\n\u201cI want to ensure that wherever we build Rosewood properties, \u2018sense of place\u2019\nis not just a tagline but infused into every aspect,\u201d Arora said.",

Rosewood\nbelieves it will at a half-dozen of its ultra-luxury hotels.\n\nSean O'Neill\n\nRosewood Hotel Group, the ultra-luxury brand, has quietly launched a program\nthat sets a higher bar for meeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\ngoals.\n\nThe initiative, called Impact Trailblazers, spotlights hotels that pledge to\nachieve at least one of six stretch goals by 2025. Goals include reducing waste\nlike single-use plastics, sourcing supplies locally, and developing community\npartnerships to hire locally.\n\n\u201cThese properties are not just meeting our ambitious sustainability goals \u2014\nthey\u2019re exceeding them, showcasing that luxury and positive impact can be\nsynonymous,\u201d said Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed, vice president of social impact at\nRosewood Hotel Group, in an exclusive interview.\n\nRosewood hopes its half-dozen top performers inspire all of its hotels and the\nbroader industry. It operates 44 hotels and has over 30 in development.\n\nThe program claims to have some early results. Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo has achieved\n90% waste diversion, operates on 100% renewable energy, and has hired 45% of its\nworkforce from underserved groups. Rosewood Phuket sources all ingredients for\nits signature restaurant locally.

It has hired 45% of its workforce from underserved local\n   groups.\n\n * Rosewood Phuket\u00a0has been one of the local pioneers in environmental\n   sustainability, earning LEED Gold Certification and achieving local sourcing\n   goals. Its signature restaurant, Ta Khai, sources all ingredients locally,\n   supporting community farmers using sustainable practices.\n\n * Rosewood Mayakoba\u00a0revived a non-profit school in Riviera Maya that had\n   stopped functioning and now supports over 450 students. It recently added a\n   separate building for a new secondary school.\n\n * Rosewood Phnom Penh\u00a0partners with a local non-profit offering vocational\n   training to Cambodian youth, bringing in students for performances and\n   demonstrations of local artistic traditions.\n\n * Rosewood Baha Mar\u00a0focuses on coral conservation in The Bahamas, partnering\n   with the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation. The resort employs\n   95% local staff and promotes diversity and female representation at\n   supervisory levels.\n\n * Rosewood Hong Kong\u00a0introduced BluHouse, a restaurant concept that employs\n   refugees and ethnic minorities.\n\n\nHOTEL BUSINESS BENEFITS\n\nAhmed challenged the notion that doing good compromises business performance.\n\n\u201cThe travel sector accepts that there\u2019s a trade-off between doing well and doing\ngood far too easily,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cThe fact that two of our Impact Trailblazers\nproperties \u2014 Rosewood Hong Kong and Rosewood S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 were recently featured\nin the latest 50 Best Hotels list shows that there\u2019s definitely not a trade-off\nin delivering luxury and having a positive social impact.\u201d\n\nThe efforts can also translate into enhancing guest loyalty.\n\n\u201cLuxury is a feeling,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the connection we create with our\nguests, and this can be fostered even without spelling out the social impact\npiece.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve stayed at Rosewood Mayakoba, you\u2019ll know that each guest receives a\nbeautiful little, colorful, folklore animal representative of Mayan culture,\u201d\nAhmed said. \u201cGuests have commented positively on these figurines. But what most\ndon\u2019t know is that these figures are special because they are carved through a\npartnership with a social enterprise that hires women recovery from domestic\nabuse.\u201d\n\nRosewood executives also believe that hotels with a social impact work have a\nbetter chance of attracting and retaining top talent.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has accelerated this trend of people wanting to know that the work\nthat they are doing most of the hours of their day is doing something positive\nfor the world,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\n\nACCOMMODATIONS SECTOR STOCK INDEX PERFORMANCE YEAR-TO-DATE\n\nWhat am I looking at?\u00a0The performance of hotels and short-term rental sector\nstocks within the\u00a0ST200.
