To do

1. Based on {list of countries}, use SERPAPI to pull recent {event} specific news, event = M&A - Refer to profile search
2. Fix company selector for multiple tickers - Think of smart way to do it (embedding?)
3. Scrape missing company information for those companies with their own websites - ???
4. Add default country select for Chloe - Done
5. Add timer for when to scrape, set on weekend to auto execute and then move the old files to archive - Not done
