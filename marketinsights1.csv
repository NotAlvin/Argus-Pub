In an IPO market where more than 100 companies raised over $4.6 billion so far this year, Bain Capital-backed Emcure is the first drugmaker to go public in 2024.
Analysts expected Emcure's shares to list at nearly a 20% premium.
The stock opened at 1,325.05 rupees on the National Stock Exchange, compared with its offer price of 1,008 rupees.
The Pune, Maharashtra state-based company's initial public offering was oversubscribed nearly 68 times last week and drew bids worth up to $11 billion with Bain selling nearly a third of its 13.07% stake.
Six pharma companies went public in 2023, the largest of which was the May 2023 debut of Mankind Pharma, whose IPO was also the largest across sectors in the year.
Emcure's focus on areas such as gynaecology, where it has a market-leading 14% share, and HIV treatments are expected to drive its sales growth, analysts have said.
Its gynaecology portfolio includes medicines for infertility treatment and to aid with menstrual pain.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman kicked off fundraising for a
new U.S.-listed closed-end fund on Tuesday, an effort people
familiar with the matter say could bring in as much as $20
billion, more than double his assets under management, some of
that from retail investors.
Last month, Ackman sold 10% of his firm, Pershing Square
Capital Management, which has posted mostly strong double digit
returns since 2019 after a spell of losses.
The new fund, Pershing Square USA Ltd, will offer lower fees
for investors and quicker access to capital than traditional
hedge funds, regulatory filings show. There will be no
management fee charged for the first year after the fund's
initial public offering and no performance fees ever.
It will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and be
available to anyone who can invest in the U.S., including
pension funds, endowments and retail investors. Roughly 80% is
expected to be raised by institutions, with retail investors
making up the rest, a filing made Tuesday shows.
Ackman, a heavy user of social media platform X, referenced
the fundraising on Tuesday when he messaged his 1.3 million
followers ""I am going to be busy for the next few weeks.
$PSUS!!""
Investors, including ones unable to write the
multimillion-dollar checks Wall Street hedge funds traditionally
demand, can pay $50 a share for the new vehicle. At the end of
June, Pershing Square Capital Management oversaw $18.7 billion
in assets, according to a company document. This includes some
$15 billion in assets in Pershing Square Holdings, the 10-year
old closed-end fund listed in Amsterdam and London.
Ackman built his reputation as an activist investor with
noisy campaigns at companies ranging from railway Canadian
Pacific to payroll and tax services company ADP.
He owned stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Hilton
Worldwide Holdings and Restaurant Brands International
at the end of the first quarter.
Citigroup, UBS Investment Bank, BofA Securities and
Jefferies are global coordinators and bookrunners for the
initial public offering.
Ackman's recent string of strong returns -- Pershing Square
Holdings earned 27% last year, 27% in 2021, 70% in 2020 and 58%
in 2019 (It dropped 8.8% in 2022 when the market tumbled) --
follow a reorganization of the firm.
Taking the advice he usually gives to companies to perform
better personally, Ackman re-engineered the way he invests and
reversed double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 followed by
smaller declines in 2017 and 2018.

covering SoftBank Group-backed Tempus AI on a bullish

diagnostics tests across oncology and other areas, including
neuropsychiatry, radiology and cardiology to clinicians and

The upbeat ratings lifted the shares of the company as much
as 7% to $35.75. The stock has lost 17.5% since the closing on
June 14, its debut day, till the end of trade on Monday.
J.P.Morgan forecasts roughly 33% revenue growth for Tempus
through 2027. It expects the company to turn a core profit by
the second half of 2025.
Tempus AI's net loss widened to $289.8 million in 2023 from
$214.1 million a year earlier, while total revenue jumped 65.8%
to $531.8 million.
However, revenue from its AI applications business
constituted about 1% of the total revenue, according to a
regulatory filing. Tempus described its AI applications revenue
as ""immaterial"".
The ""uniquely combined clinical genomic data, which the

own database, it would ""likely prove to be costly, cumbersome

* Powell wants more ""good"" economic data
* Indexes: S&P 500 +0.11%, Nasdaq +0.09%, Dow -0.05%
July 9 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record
highs on Tuesday, propelled by gains in Nvidia and
other megacaps after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell
told lawmakers that more ""good"" economic data would strengthen
the case for rate cuts.
AI heavyweight Nvidia climbed 1.4%, offsetting declines in
other chip stocks, leaving the S&P 500 and Nasdaq with marginal
gains for the session.
Microsoft dipped 1.4%, leaving the world's most
valuable company with a $3.4 trillion market capitalization.
The Nasdaq was on track for its sixth straight record-high
close as optimism about the growth of AI across the U.S.
corporate landscape offset uncertainty around the Fed's rate-cut
path.
In testimony before Congress, Powell said that while
inflation ""remains above"" the 2% soft-landing target, it has
been improving in recent months and ""more good data would
strengthen"" the case for interest-rate cuts.
However, the central bank chief insisted he was not ""sending
any signals about the timing of any future actions.""
Markets have stuck to pricing in 50 basis points of easing
for the year, seeing a nearly 72% chance for a 25 bps cut by the
Fed's September meeting, according to CME's FedWatch. Those bets
were at under 50% a month ago.
""The U.S. economy, and currently the U.S. labor market, have
been surprisingly resilient through the course of 2024 and our
base case is that a recession is not the highest probability
outcome, but rather we should continue to expect moderate growth
through the balance of this year and into next,"" said Bill
Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth
Management.
Crucial inflation data is also due this week, including
Thursday's consumer price index and the producer price index
reading on Friday.
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were up about 2%,
while Citi gained almost 3% ahead of their quarterly
reports on Friday, marking the start of second-quarter earnings
season.
Reuters reported that the Fed was considering a rule change
that could save big banks billions of dollars in capital.
Analysts on average see S&P 500 companies increasing their
aggregate earnings per share by 10.1% in the second quarter, up
from an 8.2% increase in the first quarter, according to LSEG
I/B/E/S data.
The S&P 500 was up 0.11% at 5,578.94 points.
The Nasdaq gained 0.09% to 18,419.41 points, while the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was down 0.05% at 39,324.94 points.
Tempus AI fell almost 2% after JPMorgan, Morgan
Stanley and other brokerages initiated coverage of the stock
with bullish ratings. The genetics testing firm, which receives
""immaterial"" revenue from its AI business, is down 11% from the
$37 price set in its June IPO.
Across the U.S. stock market, declining stocks
outnumbered rising ones by a 1.2-to-one ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 29 new highs and 15 new lows; the Nasdaq

Its own brands, such as Rabanne, brought it a net profit of more than 1 billion euros in 2023, with Jean Paul Gaultier being the fastest-growing within the portfolio.
In its first note on Puig, JP Morgan predicted that the company would benefit from strong demand for premium perfumes, as well as makeup and skin care, and said the shares could reach €32 a unit by December 2025.

nearly 35% to date. Ether has risen over 30% in the same
period.
""The ecosystem, I feel, at this point in time, is not ready
for such products in Singapore,"" said Loh.
""You never say never, as time evolves, and as the ecosystem
comes together, we are always known to be the most innovative
exchange or platform in the world.""
SGX has been under pressure from institutional investors and
industry groups to improve what has been a chronic challenge to
attract listings of high-growth companies.
Hamstrung by a small base of retail investors, SGX has
grappled with low liquidity and valuations. It has built up an
Asian derivatives business and remains a global listing venue
for real estate investment trusts.
In response to a question on how SGX plans to revive initial
public offerings (IPOs), Loh said ""we have a healthy pipeline"".
""Secondary listings is one way where companies get exposure
- we have that in the pipeline. We have new IPOs, some companies
are really now preparing, and ... we're going to have a
simultaneous dual listing,"" he said.
The group posted net profit of S$281.6 million ($208.70
million) in the first half of its 2024 financial year, a fall of
1% from the same period a year earlier. As of end-June, SGX had
623 listed securities with a combined market value of S$792.93
billion.

KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE, July 9 (Reuters) -
Shares in Malaysian palm oil producer Johor Plantations
Group (JPG) recovered from a flat debut to be up more
than 10% on Tuesday, after the firm raised 735 million ringgit
($156.2 million) in the country's biggest listing in more than
two years.
JPG opened at 84 sen per share, unchanged from its initial
public offering (IPO) price, before climbing as much as 10.7% to
93 sen per share in morning trade.
The IPO was the largest in Malaysia since March 2022, when
dairy producer Farm Fresh raised 1 billion ringgit.
JPG had offered 875 million shares in the listing, or a
stake of up to 35%, which gave the company a market
capitalisation of 2.1 billion ringgit.
The IPO prospectus said about 345.2 million ringgit of
the 735 million ringgit raised would go to sole selling
shareholder Kulim, a unit of Johor state government agency Johor
Corp.
JPG plans to use 196.8 million ringgit of the remaining
proceeds to construct an integrated sustainable palm oil complex
and for replanting activities, the firm said in a statement
Tuesday.
Around 174 million ringgit has been earmarked for
repayment of bank borrowings and working capital, with the rest
used to pay listing expenses, it said.
Managing Director Mohd Faris Adli Shukery said the
listing marked a milestone in the company's move towards
becoming an integrated player in the plantations industry.
RHB Investment Bank is the principal adviser
of the IPO. The bank is also the joint global coordinator, joint
bookrunner and joint underwriter with AmInvestment Bank
, CIMB and CLSA.

The shares of the specialist for High Performance Computing (HPC) were slightly down for the week on Friday afternoon, after having recorded a weekly gain of more than 38 percent in the meantime.
The jump in the share price on Tuesday was triggered by a report that struck a chord with speculators on the booming topic of artificial intelligence (AI). The Bloomberg news agency reported that the company was talking to consultants about a US IPO in the areas of AI cloud computing and data centers. A valuation of around 10 to 16 billion US dollars had been mentioned.
The day before, analyst Tim Wunderlich from Hauck Aufhäuser Investment Banking had described around 8.5 billion euros as a more realistic assumption. Overall, he considers the rumors to be credible; a US bankruptcy would trigger a valuation boost.
However, there was no new fuel for the imagination and speculators withdrew again. With their price fireworks, the shares had only just shot up to their high for the year, but had not attracted any more buyers./ag/mis/jha/"

The Bain Capital-backed company's IPO was fully subscribed on the first day of bidding and over the three-day process, it got bids worth up to 937.11 billion rupees ($11.23 billion), nearly 68 times the amount on offer, exchange data showed.
Bain sold nearly a third of its 13.07% stake in Emcure, with existing investors overall selling shares worth 11.52 billion rupees.
Emcure raised 8 billion rupees by issuing new shares in the IPO, which valued the company at up to 190.60 billion rupees, per Reuters calculations.
Emcure is going public in India's red-hot IPO market where more than 100 companies have raised around $4.6 billion through IPOs so far this year, more than double the same period last year, as per LSEG data.
Analysts are betting on its focus on areas such as gynaecology, where it has a market-leading 14% share, and HIV treatments. The generics market is dominated by firms such as Sun Pharma, Mankind Pharma, Torrent Pharma and Abbott India.
Institutional buyers, including foreign investors, banks and mutual funds, bid for 196 times the shares on offer, while retail investors bid for seven times their reserved shares.
Anchor investors, including Goldman Sachs and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), had earlier bought shares worth a total of 5.83 billion rupees.
Emcure's expansion-related spending has hit earnings over the last two years but the ramp-up of facilities will boost sales in the near term, said Sneha Poddar, vice president of research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
The stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is also attractive compared to the industry average of 40.4, and can help it ""pop"" in its trading debut, analysts said.  ($1 = 83.4690 Indian rupees)

China's securities regulator vowed on Friday to clamp down
harder on financial fraud, saying it is pushing for harsher
punishment against lawbreakers as it seeks to revive confidence
in the country's struggling stock markets.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and
five other government agencies jointly published a set of
guidelines against capital markets cheating, their latest
efforts to address a deep-rooted issue that has plagued the
world's second-biggest stock market.
The statement, which promised coordinated crackdowns
against corporate fraudsters and their accomplices, comes as
regulators are investigating the role of PricewaterhouseCoopers
(PwC) as the auditor of China Evergrande Group, whose
main China unit was found cheating.
""Financial fraud seriously disturbs capital market order
and shakes investor confidence,"" the CSRC said in the joint
statement.
Regulators will ""go after chief evils"", ""punish
accomplices"", and make coordinated, systemic and comprehensive
efforts against fraud, it said.
As part of the efforts to head off misbehaviour, the
CSRC said it has been working to revise laws toward harsher
punishment.
For example, laws have been revised to fine a company up
to 10 million yuan ($1.38 million) for dishonest disclosures,
compared with 600,000 yuan ($82,568) previously, the watchdog
said.
Meanwhile, those who violate disclosure rules could be
imprisoned for up to 10 years, compared with three years
previously. Intermediaries who publish false documents can also
be subject to 10-year imprisonment, the CSRC said.

firm Asyad Group is planning an initial public offering (IPO) of
its subsidiary Asyad Shipping Co by the end of the year and has
selected Jefferies Group and EFG Hermes as advisers, sources
familiar with the matter said.
Asyad Group, EFG Hermes and Jefferies
declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday about
the IPO plans. Details on the size of the offering were not
immediately available.
Asyad Shipping focuses on transporting liquefied natural gas
(LNG) to the international market, with a fleet that includes
very large crude carriers, product and chemical tankers, and dry
bulk carriers.
It lists Brazilian miner Vale and energy firms BP
and Shell among its customers and partners.
Asyad Group, owned by Oman's wealth fund, has more than $4
billion of assets, focuses on logistics, transportation, port
services, shipping and free zones.
Oman Investment Authority did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.
Oman, a small non-OPEC producer, is following its neighbours
the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in pushing state-led
listing programmes in a bid to advance privatisation strategies.
That strategy, along with wide reforms that include fiscal
discipline, has helped Oman pay down debt and turn its large
fiscal deficit of recent years into a surplus since 2022.
The reforms and a shake-up of state entities are being
driven by Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, who took the throne
in early 2020 after the death of Sultan Qaboos, who ruled for
nearly five decades.
Ratings agency Moody's raised Oman's credit rating from Ba2
to Ba1 in December, one level below investment grade, which was
attributed to improvements in debt affordability metrics.
Oman has been pitching to upgrade its classification to
'emerging market' from its frontier market status, which would
put it on the radar of global asset managers and bring in
foreign investment through passive funds.
Oman and Bahrain are the only countries within the six-
member Gulf Cooperation Council that are not classified as an
emerging market by index provider MSCI.
Reuters reported in 2021 that Asyad was weighing the sale of
a strategic stake in its subsidiary Oman Shipping, which was
re-branded as Asyad Shipping in 2022.
Asyad had asked banks to pitch for a mandate to help it
review a potential deal in which Asyad could divest up to 40% of
its ownership, Reuters reported at the time.

technology firm Noventiq and special purpose acquisition company
Corner Growth Acquisition have mutually agreed to
terminate their blank-check deal, the companies said on
Thursday.
The two last year struck a SPAC deal that would have resulted
in the combined company being publicly listed on U.S. exchange

Blank-check firms, also known as SPACs, are shell companies
that raise money in an initial public offering to merge with a
private company and take it public.
The deal has been scrapped as a result of the current
unfavorable SPAC market conditions and other factors, the
companies said.
Noventiq, which provides cybersecurity and artificial

for the company is to remain private at this time, CEO Herve
Tessler said.
A hallmark of pandemic-era dealmaking, SPACs have fallen out
of favor in recent years following intense scrutiny from the

production
* Bolivia pivots to cheaper oil purchases from OPEC
producers via
Botrading S.A.
* Russia aiding Bolivia with fuel supply issues amid
domestic
production decline
LA PAZ, July 4 (Reuters) - Bolivian state energy firm
YPFB is looking to improve conditions for investment in the
country's flagging oil and gas sector and seeking help from
Russia to overcome recent fuel shortages, the head of the
company told Reuters.
The landlocked South American nation is reeling from a
foiled military coup against the government last week, which
stemmed in part from a rising economic crisis linked to years of
declining oil and gas production that have hit hard-currency
reserves.
In an interview in Bolivia just days after the failed June
26 coup attempt, YPFB President Armin Dorgathen conceded that
political missteps in recent years had put off investors,
harming output. Gas production has halved from a peak a decade
ago, while oil output is its lowest since the 1990s.
""We are working to attract financing from various sides and
also looking for partners,"" Dorgathen told Reuters earlier this
week. He cited issues with payments, legislation and regulation
under the country's largely socialist leadership in recent years
that made it tough for private firms - a situation that YPFB was
now trying to change.
""The sector was discouraged,"" he said. ""We are now working
also with the partners we already have here in Bolivia - Repsol
, TotalEnergies, Petrobras, so that
additional investments can be made.""
The slide in domestic oil and gas output has been at the
heart of Bolivia's recent economic and political woes. Once an
important gas exporter to neighbors like Brazil, the production
drop has hammered export revenue and left central-bank reserves
almost depleted.
Protests linked to the lack of dollars and long queues at
gas stations have become increasingly common, stoking tensions
and leading to in-fighting in the ruling socialist MAS party
between President Luis Arce and former leader Evo Morales.
Arce headed off an apparent coup attempt last week when a
rogue general led units of armed soldiers to seize the central
square in political capital La Paz, including ramming the door
of the presidential palace with an armored vehicle. The general
cited a deteriorating economy as partly behind his rebellion.
Dorgathen said in the short-term the biggest energy issue
was a gasoline shortage, which has put a spotlight on costly
imports. Bolivia imports half of the gasoline needed to meet
domestic demand, costing some $800 million annually.
He told Reuters the country was pivoting toward more direct
- and lower-cost - purchases from producers in the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others via its new
Botrading S.A. state energy trading firm.
""Our objective through OPEC is to access cheaper fuel and
improve supplies,"" Dorgathen said. The government was also
seeking help from Russia, which is part of the so-called OPEC+
coalition, to ease fuel supplies. Russia has been hit by
sanctions on energy exports due to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's Lukoil delivered 366,000 barrels of diesel on
June 19 for YPFB from the Baltic Sea port of Vysotsk.
Dorgathen attributed the sharp decline in gas production to
a lack of investment in exploration but said that income from
exports was ""being maintained"" and disputed that there was any
issue with domestic gas supplies. He reiterated hopes for the
announcement of a major new find later this year.
""There is no internal supply problem,"" said Dorgathen. ""We
still produce almost three times more gas than we consume.""

43,Honda Motor Plans to Offer Shares Worth Billions of Dollars -- Update,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/HONDA-MOTOR-CO-LTD-6492457/news/Honda-Motor-Plans-to-Offer-Shares-Worth-Billions-of-Dollars-Update-47308631/,7267,Jul. 04,Dow Jones,"By Kosaku Narioka
Honda Motor plans to offer shares worth billions of dollars currently held by Japanese banks and insurers as part of efforts to broaden its shareholder base and improve discipline over management.
The Japanese automaker said Thursday that it plans to offer about 259.9 million shares held by Japanese banks and insurers. The offering is valued at about 465.44 billion yen ($2.88 billion) based on the latest closing price.
Honda said the offering price would be determined between July 17 and July 22. Shares closed 3.0% higher at Y1,791.0 on Thursday.
An additional 39.0 million shares may be offered, depending on demand, the automaker said.
Financial regulators have pressed Japanese companies to reduce their stakes in other listed local companies to improve corporate governance. Advocates for a reduction in cross-shareholdings say banks and insurers that hold stakes in carmakers, for instance, may not oppose bad management decisions out of fear of losing their lending or insurance businesses.
Honda said Thursday that 10 banks and insurers, including Mizuho Bank and Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance, plan to sell their shares in the company.
The automaker said in May it would buy back up to Y300.0 billion of its shares by the end of March 2025 as part of efforts to shore up its share price, which is trading below book value. It hasn't made any purchases under the program.
In May, Toyota Motor also said it would buy back up to Y1 trillion of its shares by the end of April 2025, partly to respond to any divestment plans from its stakeholders.

* AI investments drive 47% increase in US VC funding in Q2
* Investor: AI businesses require outsized funding due to
capital
intensity
* Exits remain challenging with $23.6 billion in exit value
in Q2
July 3 (Reuters) - U.S. venture capital funding surged
to $55.6 billion in the second quarter, marking the highest
quarterly total in two years, according to PitchBook data
published on Wednesday.
The latest figure shows a 47% jump from the $37.8 billion
U.S. startups raised in the first quarter, largely driven by
significant investments in artificial-intelligence companies,
including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion
raised by CoreWeave.
The ongoing excitement around building AI technology since
the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has fueled the recovery
of venture capital (VC) funding as investors place substantial
bets on startups. The hope is that revenue from AI adoption will
yield significant returns.
""Investors assign a premium to everything AI - the capital
intensity of most AI businesses requires outsized funding,"" said
Casber Wang, partner at Sapphire Ventures.
""As we discover stronger commercial use cases for AI, more
AI companies are showing real revenue.""
After reaching a record high $97.5 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2021, U.S. VC funding had been steadily declining. It
hit a recent low of $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023,
amid a high interest-rate environment and a sluggish exit
market.
The recent influx of capital into AI startups has reversed the
downward trend, prompting more investors to double down on AI
foundation model companies as well as applications from code
generation to productivity tools.
Despite the increase in deal activity, exits remain
challenging, the data shows, as small deals generated about
$23.6 billion in exit value in the second quarter this year,
down from $37.8 billion in the first quarter. The initial public
offering market has struggled to gain momentum, even after some
VC-backed companies, such as cloud data management company
Rubrik, went public.
""For VC returns to see an increase, large tech companies
must begin to list publicly at a higher pace than we have seen
through the first half of the year,"" Pitchbook analyst Kyle
Stanford said in a statement.
Emerging VC fund managers may have already felt the pressure
of a lack of proven returns, with only $37.4 billion in
commitments raised through the first half of the year. Large
firms dominated the fundraising, with Andreessen Horowitz alone
closing new funds with more than $7 billion.

5,"Crest Nicholson ""minded to recommend"" latest Bellway plan",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CREST-NICHOLSON-HOLDINGS--12583133/news/Crest-Nicholson-minded-to-recommend-latest-Bellway-plan-47350724/,CRST,04:44am,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Crest Nicholson Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it is minded to accept a revised bid proposal from fellow housebuilder Bellway PLC.
Last Wednesday, Surrey-based Crest Nicholson said Bellway submitted a new bid approach, after two previous plans had been rejected.
Under the revised terms, Crest Nicholson's shareholders would receive 0.099 shares in Bellway for each share they own plus a 4 pence per share dividend. This would comprise a 1p per share dividend and 3p per share special dividend.
Under the terms of the proposal, Crest Nicholson's shareholders would hold 18% of the enlarged group's share capital.
The firms said that based on the Bellway share price of 2,718 pence at close of business on June 13, the day before the talks were revealed, the proposal values each Crest share at 273p. However, shares in Bellway have fallen since.
Shares in Crest Nicholson rose 3.0% to 245.65p in London on Wednesday, giving it a market capitalisation of GBP631.0 million. Shares in Bellway fell 1.6% to 2,540.00p each, giving it a market cap of GBP3.03 billion.
""The boards of Bellway and Crest Nicholson believe that there is compelling strategic and financial rationale for a combination of Bellway and Crest Nicholson. The revised proposal would bring together the strength of each business with complementary brands to reinforce Bellway's position as a leading UK housebuilder, while enabling Crest Nicholson shareholders to benefit from the scale of the combined business,"" the two companies said in a statement.
Crest received an initial all-share offer on April 25 that would have seen Crest investors receive 0.089 new ordinary shares in Bellway. This proposal was rejected on May 2.
A revised offer put forward on May 7 increased the offer to 0.093 shares in Bellway for each Crest share, which would have left Crest shareholders with approximately 17% of the combined entity. This was rejected on May 14.
Last Friday, Crest Nicholson said it had rejected an approach from Avant Homes, regarding a possible all-share combination.
Avant – an affordable housebuilder focused on the Midlands, the North of England, and Scotland – is backed by US investment firm Elliott Advisors.
But Crest Nicholson said it was not currently minded to engage in discussions and had explained the decision in a letter to Avant.
Bellway has until August 8 to announce an intention to make a firm proposal to buy Crest Nicholson.

6,Adocia: end of insulin partnership program,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ADOCIA-9894600/news/Adocia-end-of-insulin-partnership-program-47350720/,ADOC,04:43am,Cercle Finance,"Biopharmaceutical company Adocia announced on Wednesday that its Chinese partner Tonghua Dongbao has decided to terminate one of their two programs conducted in partnership in the treatment of diabetes.
This licensing agreement, concluded in 2018, concerned Adocia's combination of basal and rapid-acting insulin, known as BioChaperone Combo.
As a result, the Lyon-based company will regain full rights to BioChaperone Combo.
Quoted in a press release, Jiahong Li, chairman of Tonghua Dongbao, justifies this decision by the desire to focus on other projects benefiting from more favorable market conditions.
In particular, the Chinese laboratory is said to be suffering from intense competition from biosimilars, with which fixed insulin combinations are confronted.
Tonghua Dongbao assures us, however, that Adocia remains a ""major strategic partner"" for his company, since BioChaperone Lispro, their second project in partnership, should see its phase 3 program completed this year.
Adocia stresses that Tonghua Dongbao's decision will have no impact on its cash flow horizon, which remains unchanged at the third quarter of 2025, even though the company will have to forego a milestone payment of $10 million which was expected in 2024.
Following these announcements, Adocia's share price dropped by more than 8% on Wednesday morning on the Paris Bourse.

12,Webuild and Edison will develop hydroelectric pumping,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EDISON-S-P-A-100039/news/Webuild-and-Edison-will-develop-hydroelectric-pumping-47350425/,EDNR,03:54am,Alliance News,"(Alliance News) - Edison Spa and Webuild Spa comnunicated Wednesday that they have signed a programmatic agreement for the development of hydroelectric pumping projects, highly strategic infrastructure for the ecological transition and national energy security.
Under the agreement, Edison and Webuild will enter into close cooperation, for the definition and implementation of projects related to the pumping of Pescopagano in Basilicata and Villarosa in Sicily developed by Edison.
The two pumped-storage projects are part of Edison's strategy for the growth of renewable energy in Italy, which plans to increase the group's installed green capacity to 5 GW from the current 2 GW by 2030, and jointly to build at least 500 MW of storage, as necessary tools for not dispersing the renewable energy produced at times of higher availability and ensuring the security of the power grid.
The two initiatives, in addition to the realization of new reservoirs and major engineering works completely underground to ensure the greatest compatibility with the territory, provide for the use of existing reservoirs, on which interventions will have to be implemented in order to restore the full functionality of the infrastructure by increasing both their safety levels and the volumes of water that can also be stored for further public use and to combat drought.
The Pescopagano and Villarosa projects are awaiting the conclusion of authorization procedures at the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security and concession procedures at the respective regions, with the aim of participating in the first competitive auctions, organized by Terna Spa, to acquire new storage capacity through long-term supply contracts, within the framework of the Storage Futures Market regulations, which are being defined.
""Edison and Webuild return to jointly develop the Italian hydropower supply chain. Thanks to this agreement, we create the foundations to safely achieve the energy transition, limiting the country's exposure to dependence on critical raw materials and relaunching the development of a highly strategic supply chain, of which we are champions in Europe, with clear benefits for national economic development and the increase of renewable energy in the grid, in line with decarbonization goals,"" said Nicola Monti, CEO of Edison.
""The agreement with Edison aims to pool the expertise of two major Italian private groups, world leaders in the energy and infrastructure sectors, contributing to the path of energy transition and drought mitigation in Italy and particularly in the southern regions. Creating virtuous systems of skills and resources with the entire supply chain is the key to achieving the infrastructure works Italy needs to remain competitive. Webuild is ready to make available to the country the know-how of excellence accumulated through the realization of complex and innovative projects such as the Snowy 2.0 pumped storage hydroelectric plant in Australia,"" explained Pietro Salini, CEO of Webuild.
The cooperation agreement, through the know-how and specific skills of the two major Italian groups, is aimed at optimizing the projects and the related construction methods, ensuring the best conditions to relaunch significant private investments in the South of the country, for about EUR1.2 billion, guaranteeing spillovers in the ""historical"" Italian civil and manufacturing supply chains, as well as socio-economic benefits in the territories involved, with a multiplier effect of 2.96.
Webuild's stock is up 2.1 percent to EUR2.13 per share while Edison's stock falls 0.3 percent to EUR1.53 per savings share.

The recovery from the 2017 low of EUR 7.22 had stalled in this area in recent trading days. On Wednesday morning, the share price on the Tradegate trading platform rose by 1.5 percent to EUR 9.53 compared to the Xetra close.
Previously, the Hamburg-based company had announced a multi-year collaboration with the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer for early research in the fields of metabolic and infectious diseases. Financial details were not disclosed. ""Although this collaboration will not lead to significant revenue and earnings contributions in the short term, it is a further indication of Evotec's strong scientific position in early drug development,"" said a trader. With this, Evotec continues to attract large collaboration partners.
Only on Monday, Evotec announced that it had expanded its partnership with the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz.  RBC analyst Charles Weston had praised the expansion of the partnership with Sandoz as it would improve future capacity utilization. In addition, Sandoz is a large and important customer, which is why the announcement emphasizes the capabilities of the biologics segment.
Market expert Andreas Lipkow had also referred to the sharp fall in the share price up to mid-June. ""The company has become the object of potential takeover speculation following the sharp fall in the share price. At the same time, it is now becoming clear that Evotec is also approaching interesting collaborations or deepening existing partnerships.""
The decline in Evotec's share price accelerated again in April after the company issued a cautious business outlook.  The MDax company responded to a difficult market environment with a realignment.

to sell its 30.2% stake in U.S. energy infrastructure company
Tallgrass Energy to finance green hydrogen projects, the Spanish

Enagas expects a 360 million euro ($389.38 million) capital
gain from the transaction, which is expected to close by the end

Enagas paid $836 million in 2019 to take over Tallgrass with
Blackstone and Singapore's GIC sovereign wealth fund. Tallgrass
was later delisted.
Enagas - in which the Spanish state owns a 5% stake - aims
to transition from its traditional role as a natural gas grid
operator to managing a network of hydrogen infrastructure,
taking advantage of the government's plans to develop green

It expects net investment of around 3.2 billion euros will

H2Med corridor.
To help fund the plan, it has slashed its dividend plans for
the next three years.
By the end of the decade, the group's regulated hydrogen
assets, worth some 3 billion euros, are expected to exceed those
of natural gas, seen at around 2 billion euros.

The Gateway Services restructuring reflects the strategic decision by SATS to continue investing in Singapore while scaling its international presence to capture growth opportunities overseas. Bob Chi, currently Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Gateway Services, will be redesignated CEO Gateway Services Asia-Pacific.
Since he joined SATS in 1988, Bob has been instrumental in raising Gateway Services' capabilities and customer base. Bob's new assignment will draw on his deep experience and network in the aviation industry to drive long-term value overseas. Henry Low, who is now SATS Chief Operating Officer, will assume the post of Chief Executive Officer Singapore Hub.
Both appointments will take effect from 1 October 2024. The Gateway Services business involves the provision of ground handling services such as passenger handling, baggage services, aircraft handling, security services and cargo handling services that are critical for safe, efficient and timely airport operations. Apart from the Gateway Services business in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific, SATS also offers such services via Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) stations in the Americas, and the Europe-Middle East-Africa-Asia (EMEAA) region.
In 2023, SATS acquired WFS under a S$1.8 billion deal, giving the Singapore-headquartered company a global network of 215 stations in 27 countries. Singapore Hub and Gateway Services Asia-Pacific will target growth in distinct and important market segments: Singapore Hub will be dedicated to driving aviation hub competitiveness in Singapore. By focusing on Singapore, this unit will strengthen SATS' ability to support current and future needs for Singapore's Air Hub, which groups Changi Airport, Seletar Airport and the aviation industries at these gateways.
By leveraging SATS' worldwide network, Singapore Hub can draw upon SATS' global capabilities, expertise and nurture best practices to ensure operational excellence, improved performance and a positive experience for airport users in Singapore.

background, paragraphs 5-8; analyst comment, paragraph 9)
SEOUL, July 10 (Reuters) - South Korea's Hanwha
Aerospace said on Wednesday it won a 1.38 trillion
won ($1 billion) order from Romania to supply self-propelled
howitzers.
The deal is Romania's largest arms acquisition deal in seven
years and includes 54 K9 howitzers, ammunition and 36 K10
resupply vehicles, South Korea's largest defence company by
revenue said.
The contract lasts until July 2029, Hanwha Aerospace said.
The South Korean arms procurement agency, Defense Acquisition
Program Administration, confirmed the details of the deal in a
separate statement.
Hanwha Aerospace shares rose more than 5% to a record high
in early morning trade, versus a 0.1% drop in the wider market
.
Overseas orders for Hanwha have jumped since Russia's
invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as countries sought to bolster their
arms with quick, reliable supply, analysts said.
Hanwha's land defence business has seen its order backlog
swell to about 30 trillion won at the end of March this year
from 5.1 trillion won at end-2021.
Analysts said South Korean defence firms are able to ship
arms quickly with lower costs and provide continual maintenance
partly due to the economy of scale from supplying the standing
armed forces in South Korea, which is still technically at war
with North Korea.
Hanwha now holds more than 50% share of the global market
for howitzer exports, according to data by NH Investment &
Securities.
""Given that the end of a war does not mean an end to the
growth of defence spending, and that (U.S. presidential
candidate Donald) Trump explicitly demanded that NATO and other
European countries increase their share of defence costs,
opportunities are expected to expand"" for South Korean defence
firms, said Meritz Securities analyst Lee Ji-ho in a note on
Tuesday.

said on Wednesday it had ceased negotiations with potential
Indonesian buyer Pupuk Kaltim for selling its fertilisers
business, sending the chemicals maker's shares to a more than
two-month low.
Incitec failed to balance out the risks of completing a deal
withing a ""reasonable timeframe"" and maximizing value for its
investors, leading to the talks ending, it said.
Shares in Incitec dropped as much as 6.2% to A$2.72, their
lowest since late April, while the benchmark index fell
0.5%.
Incitec has been looking for ways to improve value and
returns for its shareholders and now will begin a share buyback
worth up to A$900 million ($606.51 million), after the talks
with PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur, Southeast Asia's
biggest urea fertilisers manufacturer, fell through.
""Given that the potential purchaser PT Pupuk Kalimantan
Timur is an Indonesian state-owned enterprise, approval from the
Foreign Investment Review Board would have been uncertain if the
sale had proceeded because of the importance of Incitec Pivot's
fertiliser supply in the Australian food chain,"" said Ian
Chitterer, vice president and senior credit officer, Moody's
Ratings.
Pupuk Kaltim did not immediately respond to a Reuters
request for comment.
Incitec had said in May that it was in advanced talks with
the Indonesian firm over the unit divestiture and had put a
pause on the A$500 million buyback announced in December.
Incitec added that its primary focus would be to progress
the buyback, while it continues to ""assess options"" for the
separation of its explosives and fertilisers businesses.
The firm will continue to manage its explosives business,
Dyno Nobel and the fertilisers business separately, it said.
Incitec has in the past faced investor backlash over its
plans to de-merge the explosives manufacturing business by way
of a separate listing.

29,Tyson Foods to sell Georgia poultry complex to House of Raeford Farms,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TYSON-FOODS-INC-14672/news/Tyson-Foods-to-sell-Georgia-poultry-complex-to-House-of-Raeford-Farms-47347419/,TSN,06:13pm,Reuters,"July 9 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods said on Tuesday
it will sell its Georgia-based poultry complex to chicken
products maker House of Raeford Farms, as the U.S meatpacker
looks to cut costs amid subdued demand.
The company has been grappling over the last few quarters
with price-conscious customers cutting back on meat purchases
and has made efforts to return to profitability by shuttering
chicken, beef and pork plants, as well as laying off corporate
employees.
Tyson said House of Raeford Farms intends to continue
poultry processing at the complex in Vienna, Georgia and would
utilize the existing workforce.
The U.S. meatpacker, whose finance chief was suspended after
arrest for intoxicated driving in June, said it would continue
to serve customer orders from other production locations.
The terms of the agreement, which are subject to approval
from U.S. regulators, were not disclosed.
In March, the company had announced it would permanently
close a pork plant in Perry, Iowa, eliminating about 1,200 jobs.
This step was in addition to the closure of six chicken plants
in the United States since the beginning of 2023.
In December, egg producer Cal-Maine Foods had also
agreed to acquire a shut chicken broiler processing plant,
hatchery and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri, from Tyson.

Riyadh Air, owned by Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF, will be a second national airline, based in the capital Riyadh, alongside existing flag carrier Saudia, based in Jeddah.
Under the agreement, Atlanta-based Delta will serve as Riyadh Air's exclusive partner in North America, offering its customers access to hundreds of U.S. destinations.
For Delta's customers, the partnership will open new destinations in Saudi Arabia, the airlines said. The U.S. carrier also plans to launch future nonstop service to Riyadh.
Currently, no U.S. airline files to Saudi Arabia.
Delta's first partnership with a Gulf carrier marks a shift from the last decade when the Atlanta-based airline along with United and American Airlines lobbied to curb competition from Gulf state carriers.
In 2022, however, United unveiled a codeshare agreement with Dubai's Emirates. American Airlines has a similar arrangement with Qatar Airways.
The tie-up between Delta and Riyadh Air envisions codesharing, which will allow them to sell seats on each other's flights, but will require regulatory approvals.
In the future, the two carriers plan to expand the partnership into a joint venture, allowing collaboration on network planning. Such an arrangement would require  immunity from antitrust laws.
Currently, Delta has joint ventures with Air France-KLM, British airline Virgin Atlantic, Chile's LATAM Airlines and Korean Air.
Riyadh Air is trying to build its network through a series of bilateral partnerships and code shares rather than relying purely on its own planes, or joining a formal airline alliance.
Last month, it announced partnerships with Singapore Airlines and Air China.

""The bid rumours do not really come as a surprise, as the depressed post-COVID-19 valuations of specialist London-based (re)insurers - including peers Beazley, Lancashire and Conduit Re - always raised questions as to whether they would be potential targets,"" Berenberg analyst Tryfonas Spyrou said in a note to clients.
The specialist insurer, which is headquartered in Bermuda and listed in London, reported $625.9 million in pretax profit on $3.56 billion net insurance contract written premiums for 2023.

DataRoom understands that Pacific Avenue Capital Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm consisting of former Platinum Equity executives, has fallen away from the sale process after earlier showing interest. Also no longer in the mix is Sydney turnaround fund Anchorage Capital Partners.
However, it is understood that Allegro Funds, which also specialises in turnaround opportunities, remains in the frame. The contest, run by Miles Advisory, is shaping up to reach a conclusion by August 2024. Tradelink was placed up for sale by Fletcher Building after the company started wrestling with large debt levels of about $2 billion against a $2 billion market value and lower earnings as recessionary conditions in New Zealand and a weaker trading environment in Australia affected its bottom line.
Earlier, there were expectations that Fletcher Building could lure anywhere between $100 million and $300 million for the business, which competes with industry heavyweight Reece and has struggled against its larger competitor. New Zealand-based Auckland Airport director Mark Cairns is believed to be in the running. Fletcher's most attractive assets are considered to be plasterboard, insulation, concrete and cement and aggregates operations, while the rest would be a distraction for a buyer."

The deal comes weeks after Redstone abruptly called off negotiations with Skydance on June 11. Skydance sweetened its offer for the family's holding company, National Amusements, which controls 77% of Paramount's voting shares.

Delhi-based Shine Star Build-Cap Private Limited emerged as the highest bidder to acquire the public sector lender?s non-performing debt in the company with a bid of INR 720 million, while Suraksha Asset Reconstruction Private Limited came in second with a bid of INR 650 million. Previously, J.C. Flowers Asset Reconstruction Private Limited had submitted a binding bid of INR 618 million for the stressed asset during an e-auction held on June 27.
Union Bank of India has given JC Flowers time until July 11 to match the highest bid, failing which Shine Star will be declared the successful bidder for Jaypee Healthcare.

18,How Raiffeisen's bet on Russia took it to the brink,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/RAIFFEISEN-BANK-INTERNATI-6497717/news/How-Raiffeisen-s-bet-on-Russia-took-it-to-the-brink-47318854/,RBI,Jul. 05,Reuters,"VIENNA, July 4 (Reuters) - For more than four months,
U.S. envoys delivered increasingly shrill warnings to Austria's
Raiffeisen Bank International to scrap a deal they
said had links to one of Russia's most powerful oligarchs. In
May, Washington's patience snapped.
In a written ultimatum that landed on May 8 at the bank, its
supervisor the European Central Bank and Austria's government,
Washington threatened to curb Raiffeisen's access to the dollar,
according to one person who has seen the letter, a potential
death sentence for the biggest Western lender in Russia.
Within hours, Raiffeisen had called off the deal first
announced in December, but the damage was done: by pushing
Washington to the brink, the seeds of mistrust had been sown,
said one person with knowledge of U.S. thinking.
Now, nearly two months on, pressure on the bank to loosen
its ties with Russia is mounting, from both Washington and the
ECB, three people with knowledge of the process said.
Raiffeisen, and Austria, are on the front line of a global
push by the United States to isolate Russia by reinforcing
sanctions on banking and choking off access to Western goods
more than two years after it invaded Ukraine.
Reuters has spoken to more than a dozen people, including
senior officials involved in discussions with the United States,
Austria and European regulators, as well as sources with direct
knowledge of the bank's strategy.
The interviews show it remains under immediate international
pressure to retreat from Russia - despite ending its deal to buy
a stake in Austrian construction firm Strabag, which
the U.S. Treasury said in May belonged to sanctioned Russian
businessman Oleg Deripaska.
Deripaska has told Reuters the U.S. response to the deal was
""balderdash"" and a spokesperson for the businessman reiterated
that ""Deripaska had zero interest in Strabag at this moment"".
The interviews also show that Raiffeisen failed to take heed
of warnings well over a year ago from European regulators that
it was a playing a high-risk game with Washington over its
business in Russia.
Washington's threat to penalise Raiffeisen has not been
withdrawn and it continues to closely monitor the bank, its
relations with Russia and any potential sanctions violations,
two of the people with knowledge of the process said.
If Raiffeisen was prepared to do a deal that Washington has
linked to Deripaska, who is accused by the United States of
being part of a Kremlin-backed campaign to meddle in its 2016
presidential election, it could take other risks, said the
person familiar with U.S. thinking.
A Raiffeisen spokesperson said exchanges with the U.S.
Treasury regarding Russia were ""generally friendly"" and that it
was continuously reducing its exposure in the country.
The U.S. Treasury declined to comment for this story.
Washington has the power to fine banks in breach of
sanctions, or cut them off from the dollar. It hit French bank
BNP Paribas, for instance, with a $9 billion penalty
in 2014 for violating U.S. sanctions on Sudan, Iran and Cuba.
""Raiffeisen, and Austria, are playing with fire,"" said Nina
Tomaselli, an Austrian lawmaker from the Greens, which are part
of the country's ruling coalition. ""Whether we like it or not,
America has got the whip hand.""
'FLYING BLIND'
While many Western governments have shunned Russia, some
Austrian politicians have been reluctant to sever ties with a
country still thanked for allowing Austria's rehabilitation in
1955 following World War Two. In return, Austria commited to
remain neutral.
Austria still relies heavily on Russian gas, while Vienna
has acted as a hub for cash from Russia and its ex-Soviet
neighbours through a financial network built after the fall of
communism.
But Raiffeisen's European supervisors want immediate action.
ECB officials attended a meeting of the bank's supervisory board
in June to urge the lender to act quickly and the regulator has
demanded it outline in the coming weeks what steps it will take,
one of the people with knowledge of the process said.
A senior international regulator said the aborted Strabag
deal had exacerbated relations with the bank's ECB supervisors
and that they viewed Raiffeisen as dishonest. The regulators
also worry they are ""flying blind"", knowing too little about
Raiffeisen's Russian operations, a second person said.
Raiffeisen said the bank had cut the volume of loans and
payments in Russia and was taking steps to reduce deposits, of
which it has 14 billion euros ($15 billion) there.
The ECB declined to comment for this story.
With sprawling industrial holdings, more than 18 million
customers from Vienna to Moscow and 44,000 staff, Raiffeisen is
a financial linchpin for Austria and much of eastern Europe.
Russia has become an even bigger money spinner for the bank
since the Ukraine war started in 2022 - making up about half of
the group's profits in the first three months of this year - as
fees on payments abroad spiked.
Nevertheless, the U.S. Treasury's threat to pull the rug out
from under Raiffeisen continues to resonate deeply with its
management, a person with knowledge of the bank's thinking said,
adding that such a step would be ""fatal"", in part because big
corporates who use it for international payments would leave.
The U.S. authorities are aware of the seismic fallout such a
move would have on Raiffeisen, as well as the potential it could
spill over into the wider financial system, and are treading
carefully, one of the people with knowledge of U.S. thinking
said.
PREPARING FOR THE WORST
That's why Washington would prefer European regulators to
force the bank to loosen its ties with Russia, the two people
with direct knowledge of the process said.
But Europe's efforts to rein in Raiffeisen as part of
measures to choke Russia's economy following Moscow's invasion
Ukraine have been chequered.
In the first few months of 2023, the ECB and European
regulators at the Single Resolution Board, an authority that
winds down banks in trouble, discussed various scenarios should
Raiffeisen run into difficulties, two people with knowledge of
those talks said.
The talks, which have not been previously reported, prompted
a conversation between the officials and Raiffeisen about
preparing a plan to deal with an existential crisis that could
be triggered by a U.S. penalty.
The U.S. Treasury's sanctions enforcer, the Office of
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), had opened an investigation into
Raiffeisen's Russian activities in early 2023.
One of those sources said regulators examined a potential
break-up of the bank but in talks with Raiffeisen, it was
reluctant to prepare a plan for a contained winding up in an
emergency - and won the support of Austrian officials who feared
any such discussion could trigger panic were it to leak.
The discussions were abandoned in March 2023, when two U.S.
banks and Credit Suisse collapsed, distracting the attention of
regulators, the person said.
Raiffeisen said it terminated the Strabag deal when the
regulatory conditions were not met, that no money changed hands
and it does not consider its access to the U.S. financial system
at risk.
The Single Resolution Board and Austria's finance ministry
declined to comment on the 2023 discussions.
'LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'
While European Union countries forge joint sanctions on
Russia together, it is left to countries to enforce them. In
Austria, various ministries and authorities are responsible for
monitoring and enforcing sanctions.
Austrian officials in various arms of government advised
Raiffeisen privately against the Strabag deal but it pressed on
anyway, three people familiar with the matter said.
Speaking up to Raiffeisen, which is part of a powerful group
rooted in Alpine farming and has wide political clout, is
difficult in Austria, said one public official.
Austria's central bank, which has the power to freeze
assets, said it was up to banks themselves to ensure deals did
not break sanctions.
""We have a lot of legislation but enforcement is
extremely weak. If countries have an economic interest, that
often prevails,"" said Sophia in't Veld, a European Union
lawmaker who helped pass sanctions rules.
To be sure, Russia has made it clear it wants Western banks
such Raiffeisen to stay, which could make it hard for them to
get permission to leave - and get their money out.
Italian bank UniCredit, also present in Russia
albeit on a smaller scale than Raiffeisen, has challenged the
ECB legally over the central bank's push to get it to leave
Russia.
Raiffeisen has about 5 billion euros of capital trapped in
Russia, according to one of the sources, and the Strabag deal
was designed to free up $1.5 billion of that.
The bank has repeatedly said it intends to get out of
Russia, but can't say when that might happen.
""Instead of pulling back from Russia, Raiffeisen has spent
more than two years looking for loopholes and gaps to get its
money out,"" said Austrian lawmaker Tomaselli.

Kumar Mangalam Birla's UltraTech is in advanced negotiations with the promoter of Orient Cement, his uncle CK Birla, after restarting talks in recent weeks, said people familiar with the discussions to ET. UltraTech is said to have offered a price of INR 350 - INR 375 per share, a 22% premium to the current market price of INR 307.
In the past month, the Orient Cement stock has shot up 45%, hitting an all-time high of INR 329 on July 1, largely on speculation that an acquisition deal was near conclusion. Kumar Birla's renewed efforts to buy Orient are seen as an attempt to trump Adani Cement Industries Limited and consolidate UltraTech?s position in the southern and western markets, especially Maharashtra and Telangana, after buying a 23% stake in India Cements at the end of last month. Adani Cement, which controls India's second-largest cement capacity, has been engaged in talks with CK Birla since late last year but is said to have baulked at the valuation sought.
The promoter stake in Orient Cement held by the Birla family and private investment vehicles is 37.9%. The company has a market value of INR 64,175.1 million, having almost doubled from INR 38,780 million in October when ET had first reported on CK Birla?s approach to Adani. Adani?s offer was also contingent on obtaining environmental clearance for the expansion phase in Telangana, which the current Orient management was unable to commit to definitively, according to sources?
citation to ET. A formal announcement is expected before or during Orient Cement's upcoming quarterly earnings scheduled for July 19. However, the final valuation is still being worked upon and the deal may not happen if there?s a mismatch, said the people cited to ET."

For months, Paramount?s controlling shareholder and Skydance sought to seal a merger that would transform the media industry, before those talks ground to a sudden halt in June. Now, just weeks later, the two sides have reached a preliminary deal to merge, four people familiar with the negotiations said.
The agreement will still have to be approved by a special committee of Paramount?s board of directors, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the talks resumed. If they win that approval, the deal will combine Paramount - the parent company of CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon - and Skydance, the up-and-coming movie studio that helped produce ?Top Gun: Maverick,? into a new giant in Hollywood.
An agreement would be a changing of the guard in the media world, as legacy companies like Paramount struggle with the decline of cable TV and with streaming services that bleed cash. Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount through her stake in its parent company, National Amusements, is part of the family that has run the media conglomerate for decades. The new company would be backed instead by big-ticket investors like the private-equity firm RedBird and David Ellison, son of the Oracle founder Larry Ellison.
It would also end a dramatic saga that has played out over months. Paramount and Skydance entered into exclusive negotiations in April only to let them lapse in May without striking an agreement. Their talks continued, even as other suitors emerged.
The two finally seemed to be headed toward a deal in June after a marathon weekend of negotiating. But just as Paramount?s special committee was set to vote on that deal, lawyers for National Amusements emailed Paramount?s special committee to end the discussions. In the weeks that followed, Paramount outlined what a stand-alone future might look like for the company as it navigated a challenging media landscape.
It appointed three executives to succeed Bob Bakish, who stepped down as chief executive in April, through a joint ?office of the C.E.O.? role. They said in a recent shareholder meeting that they planned to explore a streaming joint venture and cut $500 million in costs as the media giant grappled with about $14 billion in debt.
The company?s shares have fallen more than 16% over the past month, as Paramount?s investors have remained concerned about its prospects. Paramount has been exploring a deal despite strong headwinds to traditional media. Critics have argued that the company was too late to streaming, leaving it undersized and lagging behind its rivals.
They also point to missed opportunities, such as when Mr. Bakish balked at selling trophy assets like Showtime and BET to suitors offering billions in recent months. Skydance and National Amusements resumed their negotiations not long after a cooling-off period, three of the people said. This latest deal would give Ms. Redstone better financial terms than the previous iteration.
National Amusements? equity would be valued at $1.75 billion, up slightly from $1.7 billion in the last incarnation, three of the people said. The deal would also give National Amusements a greater degree of protection against potential shareholder lawsuits over the deal.
That had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations, given significant shareholder angst about the transaction. The deal is expected to offer Paramount a 45-day ?go shop? period in which it can talk to other suitors about a potential deal, three of the sources said.
The billionaire Barry Diller and his digital media conglomerate, IAC, have expressed interest in National Amusements, as has Edgar Bronfman Jr., the media and finance executive, and Steven Paul, the Hollywood executive best known for his work on the ?Baby Geniuses? franchise. The Paramount board committee will now evaluate whether those new terms will be sufficiently palatable for shareholders."

The stock rose as much as 6.5% in July 3, 2024 trading, hitting the highest level in more than two years.
They were up 4.2% at the close in Sydney, valuing Santos at AUD 26 billion ($17.4 billion). The company?s languishing share price has led to several failed takeover attempts in recent years and spurred calls for it to break up its businesses. State-owned Aramco and Adnoc have been conducting preliminary evaluations of Santos as a possible acquisition target, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
The Middle Eastern energy giants are investing billions of dollars in natural gas, which is seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition, especially in Asia. Aramco agreed last year to buy a minority stake in MidOcean Energy LLC, an arm of investment firm EIG Global Energy Partners that has interests in a number of LNG projects, for about $500 million. Deliberations are ongoing, and the suitors haven?t decided whether to proceed with any proposals, the people said.
Aramco could opt to team up with a partner if it moves ahead, some of the people said. Aramco said in a statement that reports it?s considering an offer for Santos are ?inaccurate,? without elaborating.
Representatives for Adnoc and Santos declined to comment. In 2018, Santos rejected multiple offers from US-based Harbour Energy Ltd., while preliminary talks with Woodside Energy Group Ltd. broke down earlier this year. Some investors have urged the company to split its coveted LNG assets from oil operations in Alaska and its domestic gas business in Australia to cash in on higher valuations.
?Santos has been shopping itself for awhile,? said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at Sydney-based MST Marquee. ?But once they look under the surface at Santos they see too many problems at the legacy onshore Australian assets and walk away.?
Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher, who transformed Santos into Australia?s second-largest oil and gas producer, has been under pressure to boost the performance of a stock that has lagged peers and to crank up shareholder returns. An activist investor last year slammed the company for committing too much capital for growth."

2024
* Energy savings and future price stability are key
incentives
* Large rooftop solar subsidies tender bids up 107% y/y
BERLIN, July 2 (Reuters) - For months, Philip Matthias
tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their
company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming
to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal
products factory.
Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million)
investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his
father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the
project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that
could power around 900 households in addition to the factory.
""The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The
manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is
an extremely lucrative investment,"" Matthias told Reuters.
Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia
fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to
accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80%
of the country's energy from renewables by 2030.
Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price
to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as
reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly
turning to solar to get around high energy costs.
Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and
wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have
yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high
grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar
power, they avoid those fees and taxes.
Companies consumed around 69% of Germany's national
electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association
showed.
""As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of
decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly
recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,""
said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW
association for small- and medium-sized businesses.
CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT
Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops
rose by 81% year-on-year in the first four months of the year,
outpacing the 1% growth in the residential sector, data by the
BSW solar power association shows.
A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of
German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar
power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that
nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar
energy by 2030.
In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest
residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was
expanding into the commercial sector.
""The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to
be very sustainable,"" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial
and industrial solar startup Enviria.
An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied
Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287
gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet
Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways,
parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly
reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and
planning approvals can take up to a decade.
A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has
spurred companies to embrace solar energy.
""The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from
China. That means that the system that we are building now is
about 20% cheaper than a year ago,"" Matthias said.
A German legislative package passed in April easing
regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as
well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds
operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand
further.
State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic
projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender,
have also boosted the trend.
The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw
a 107% rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the
federal grid network agency showed.
A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour,
higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it
currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated
electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said.
Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies'
electricity trading strategies.
""There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and
the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,"" Hugo Willink,
Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told
Reuters.
Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz in May to
build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory
roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.

This is according to projections by the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) and the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), which were made available to dpa on Monday.
In the first half of 2023, the share of renewable energies was still 52 percent. Gross domestic electricity consumption totaled 261 billion kilowatt hours and was therefore 0.3 percent below the previous year's figure.
More than half from renewables
In the first half of the year, renewable energies covered more than half of monthly electricity consumption each month, emphasized the BDEW. Since April, they have had a monthly share of 59 percent.
""Photovoltaic systems in particular produced a total of 37 billion kilowatt hours, significantly more electricity than in the previous year - also thanks to the record expansion in 2023,"" the energy industry association noted.
In June 2024, PV systems generated more than 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity within one month for the very first time. Hydropower also made an above-average contribution to electricity generation with 12 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
The majority comes from onshore wind turbines
Of the 58 percent, 24 percentage points came from onshore wind power, 14 percentage points from photovoltaics, 9 percentage points from biomass, 5 percentage points from hydropower, 5 percentage points from offshore wind power and 1 percentage point from electricity generation from municipal waste.
Kerstin Andreae, Chairwoman of the BDEW Executive Board, described the figures as a ""reward for the persistent expansion of wind energy and photovoltaics in recent years"".
Gas-fired power plants necessary as plan B
The construction of hydrogen-capable gas-fired power plants is now important. ""Because despite the pleasing figures: Electricity generation from wind and solar is not constant. We need secure power for system services and times when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing,"" said Andreae.
The record shows that a secure and greenhouse gas-neutral power supply based on almost 100 percent renewable energies, including hydrogen, is achievable by 2035, explained ZSW Board Member Frithjof Staiß. This provides a stable foundation for the industry on its path to climate-neutral production./tob/DP/zb"

European Union's electricity has been generated by CO2
emissions-free sources so far this year, making it the bloc's
greenest power mix to date, industry data showed on Monday.
Emissions-free sources produced 74% of EU electricity in
January-June, of which 50% was from renewable sources like wind
and solar, and 24% from nuclear, industry association
Eurelectric said.
""The electricity generation of Europe has never had such a
low-carbon profile before,"" Eurelectric Secretary General
Kristian Ruby told Reuters.
Coal produced 9% of EU electricity and gas 13% - the lowest
shares for each fossil fuel for the same period in any year to
date.
The main driver of Europe's changing energy mix is the rapid
installation of renewable energy capacity. The EU built 56
gigawatts of new solar power capacity in 2023 - the highest in
any year to date - and 16GW of new wind capacity.
However, Europe's electricity demand has also decreased,
making it easier for green sources to cover a bigger share of
the overall mix. EU power demand was 5.8% lower in the first
half of this year than in the same period in 2021.
European energy prices surged to record highs in 2022 after
Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe. The resulting energy
crisis forced industries and consumers to use less energy to
curb their bills - with some industries yet to recover
production to pre-crisis levels, depressing their energy
consumption.
More renewable energy will help Europe meet its climate
targets and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. But there
are signs countries' aging power grids are struggling to cope
with the changing energy mix.
Belgian power grid operator Elia warned last month
that a recent jump in Belgium's solar power capacity will cause
periods of surplus cheap energy this summer, making it harder to
balance the grid.
Ruby urged policymakers to invest in upgrading power grids
to cope with bigger shares of renewable capacity, including by
adding storage capacity to absorb cheap excess power so it
doesn't go to waste.
""We need a physical build-out of the grid with quite a bit
of urgency,"" he said.

45,Medibank & Macquarie Group Reportedly May Acquire in HealthCare Space,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MEDIBANK-PRIVATE-LIMITED-18387598/news/Medibank-Macquarie-Group-Reportedly-May-Acquire-in-HealthCare-Space-47280781/,MPL,Jun. 26,S&P Capital IQ,"Only several months after Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL) and Macquarie Group Limited (ASX:MQG) teamed up to make acquisitions in the healthcare space, it appears they could be doing so on a second occasion. This time, it's the area of primary healthcare where the pair is showing some interest in buying businesses. The understanding is that inquiries are being made to gain more knowledge of the space around the market ahead of a potential move into the sector on behalf of the $10 billion Australian listed private health insurer Medibank with Macquarie in tow.
If they are in the market for an acquisition, the obvious place to look is in the backyard of BGH Capital. The Melbourne-based private equity firm backed by Ben Gray, Simon Harle and Robin Bishop, formerly of TPG Capital and Macquarie Group respectively, owns the former primary healthcare unit of Healius. BGH purchased the business in 2020 for $500 million and has since renamed it ForHealth.
BGH has reportedly been gauging views around the market in recent months to assess whether now would be a good time to place the business up for sale. General practice has been a challenging area in the healthcare industry, with a shortage of doctors prepared to take on bulk billing cases as they are unable to make the numbers stack up. But driving a stronger performance this current financial year has been the work it has carried out for the government by providing Medicare Urgent Care Clinics.
It is expected that BGH would want more than $1 billion for ForHealth, which operates more than 80 large-scale, multidisciplinary medical centres, providing critical primary care services, including GPs, dental, specialist, diagnostic imaging, pathology, allied health and pharmacy services."

(NYSE:BX) on June 25, 2024 said it will not raise its offer of USD 1.31 per share in cash for Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited (LSE:SONG) which values the UK music rights owner at USD 1.58 billion (EUR 1.48 billion). The latest proposal was made in early June after previously Hipgnosis accepted Blackstone's raised takeover offer worth USD 1.57 billion, abandoning its deal with US music company Concord. Blackstone earlier said that the latest increase in its offer was due to the lower-than-expected adviser fees being incurred by Hipgnosis in relation to the transaction.
The terms of the deal have also been revised in terms of its nature, which was changed from a takeover to a scheme of arrangement, meaning that it needs to be approved by at least 75% of Hipgnosis shareholders."
47,MNC Capital Increases All-Cash Offer to Acquire Vista Outdoor to $42 Per Share,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VISTA-OUTDOOR-INC-20798585/news/MNC-Capital-Increases-All-Cash-Offer-to-Acquire-Vista-Outdoor-to-42-Per-Share-47251143/,VSTO,Jun. 26,S&P Capital IQ,"MNC Capital Partners, L.P. announced it has increased its all-cash offer to acquire Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:VSTO) to $42.00 per share, or approximately $3.2 billion. The revised proposal represents a premium of 55% to the VWAP from when Vista?s transaction with the Czechoslovak Group a.s. (?CSG?) was announced on October 16, 2023 to the last closing price before MNC?s initial offer on February 19, 2024. The revised offer is also an over 40% premium to the last closing price prior to MNC?s initial offer.
When MNC made its initial bid in mid-February, Vista?s shares were trading below $30 - at that time, the market reflected the acquisition of Kinetic by CSG. On June 25, 2024, Vista shares closed at $33.78 - the shares would have closed significantly lower without the expectation that MNC would be continuing to pursue the acquisition of Vista. MNC?s revised proposal represents a premium of almost 25% to June 25, 2024?s closing price.
Given MNC?s belief that its acquisition of Vista is in the best interests of shareholders, employees and national security, MNC decided to make one final effort for such acquisition by increasing its June 6, 2024 proposal from $39.50 per share all cash to $42.00 per share all cash. MNC said that it cannot see any possible basis or reason to further raise it. MNC?s revised proposal is all cash, has no regulatory issues and is not subject to any financing conditions.
MNC holds secured debt and equity commitments more than sufficient to close the transaction and stands ready to provide those to Vista. MNC expects that the Vista Board will move forward expeditiously to sign a merger agreement on the terms proposed. MNC believes a definitive agreement can be executed in a matter of days."

and could open the door to more takeover interest in Deliveroo. They said: ?In this instance, the talks have failed. ?But such is the strength of the financial, industrial and strategic logic of a Deliveroo takeover, we would not be surprised to see similar such headlines to re-emerge in the short term.
?In our view, the key to unlocking a recommended offer from Deliveroo is understanding the sensibilities of the founder CEO, Will Shu. ?This may only be the start?."
