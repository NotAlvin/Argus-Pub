production
* Bolivia pivots to cheaper oil purchases from OPEC
producers via
Botrading S.A.
* Russia aiding Bolivia with fuel supply issues amid
domestic
production decline
LA PAZ, July 4 (Reuters) - Bolivian state energy firm
YPFB is looking to improve conditions for investment in the
country's flagging oil and gas sector and seeking help from
Russia to overcome recent fuel shortages, the head of the
company told Reuters.
The landlocked South American nation is reeling from a
foiled military coup against the government last week, which
stemmed in part from a rising economic crisis linked to years of
declining oil and gas production that have hit hard-currency
reserves.
In an interview in Bolivia just days after the failed June
26 coup attempt, YPFB President Armin Dorgathen conceded that
political missteps in recent years had put off investors,
harming output. Gas production has halved from a peak a decade
ago, while oil output is its lowest since the 1990s.
""We are working to attract financing from various sides and
also looking for partners,"" Dorgathen told Reuters earlier this
week. He cited issues with payments, legislation and regulation
under the country's largely socialist leadership in recent years
that made it tough for private firms - a situation that YPFB was
now trying to change.
""The sector was discouraged,"" he said. ""We are now working
also with the partners we already have here in Bolivia - Repsol
, TotalEnergies, Petrobras, so that
additional investments can be made.""
The slide in domestic oil and gas output has been at the
heart of Bolivia's recent economic and political woes. Once an
important gas exporter to neighbors like Brazil, the production
drop has hammered export revenue and left central-bank reserves
almost depleted.
Protests linked to the lack of dollars and long queues at
gas stations have become increasingly common, stoking tensions
and leading to in-fighting in the ruling socialist MAS party
between President Luis Arce and former leader Evo Morales.
Arce headed off an apparent coup attempt last week when a
rogue general led units of armed soldiers to seize the central
square in political capital La Paz, including ramming the door
of the presidential palace with an armored vehicle. The general
cited a deteriorating economy as partly behind his rebellion.
Dorgathen said in the short-term the biggest energy issue
was a gasoline shortage, which has put a spotlight on costly
imports. Bolivia imports half of the gasoline needed to meet
domestic demand, costing some $800 million annually.
He told Reuters the country was pivoting toward more direct
- and lower-cost - purchases from producers in the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others via its new
Botrading S.A. state energy trading firm.
""Our objective through OPEC is to access cheaper fuel and
improve supplies,"" Dorgathen said. The government was also
seeking help from Russia, which is part of the so-called OPEC+
coalition, to ease fuel supplies. Russia has been hit by
sanctions on energy exports due to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's Lukoil delivered 366,000 barrels of diesel on
June 19 for YPFB from the Baltic Sea port of Vysotsk.
Dorgathen attributed the sharp decline in gas production to
a lack of investment in exploration but said that income from
exports was ""being maintained"" and disputed that there was any
issue with domestic gas supplies. He reiterated hopes for the
announcement of a major new find later this year.
""There is no internal supply problem,"" said Dorgathen. ""We
still produce almost three times more gas than we consume.""

1,Honda Motor Plans to Offer Shares Worth Billions of Dollars -- Update,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/HONDA-MOTOR-CO-LTD-6492457/news/Honda-Motor-Plans-to-Offer-Shares-Worth-Billions-of-Dollars-Update-47308631/,7267,05:13am,Dow Jones,"By Kosaku Narioka
Honda Motor plans to offer shares worth billions of dollars currently held by Japanese banks and insurers as part of efforts to broaden its shareholder base and improve discipline over management.
The Japanese automaker said Thursday that it plans to offer about 259.9 million shares held by Japanese banks and insurers. The offering is valued at about 465.44 billion yen ($2.88 billion) based on the latest closing price.
Honda said the offering price would be determined between July 17 and July 22. Shares closed 3.0% higher at Y1,791.0 on Thursday.
An additional 39.0 million shares may be offered, depending on demand, the automaker said.
Financial regulators have pressed Japanese companies to reduce their stakes in other listed local companies to improve corporate governance. Advocates for a reduction in cross-shareholdings say banks and insurers that hold stakes in carmakers, for instance, may not oppose bad management decisions out of fear of losing their lending or insurance businesses.
Honda said Thursday that 10 banks and insurers, including Mizuho Bank and Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance, plan to sell their shares in the company.
The automaker said in May it would buy back up to Y300.0 billion of its shares by the end of March 2025 as part of efforts to shore up its share price, which is trading below book value. It hasn't made any purchases under the program.
In May, Toyota Motor also said it would buy back up to Y1 trillion of its shares by the end of April 2025, partly to respond to any divestment plans from its stakeholders.

Hudson stresses that Sanofi is not a coding company, but a drug discovery and development company. The collaboration with OpenAI and Formation Bio makes it possible to customise language models to treat previously incurable diseases. Sanofi is focusing on using AI to amplify the effectiveness of its employees rather than downsizing.

* AI investments drive 47% increase in US VC funding in Q2
* Investor: AI businesses require outsized funding due to
capital
intensity
* Exits remain challenging with $23.6 billion in exit value
in Q2
July 3 (Reuters) - U.S. venture capital funding surged
to $55.6 billion in the second quarter, marking the highest
quarterly total in two years, according to PitchBook data
published on Wednesday.
The latest figure shows a 47% jump from the $37.8 billion
U.S. startups raised in the first quarter, largely driven by
significant investments in artificial-intelligence companies,
including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion
raised by CoreWeave.
The ongoing excitement around building AI technology since
the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has fueled the recovery
of venture capital (VC) funding as investors place substantial
bets on startups. The hope is that revenue from AI adoption will
yield significant returns.
""Investors assign a premium to everything AI - the capital
intensity of most AI businesses requires outsized funding,"" said
Casber Wang, partner at Sapphire Ventures.
""As we discover stronger commercial use cases for AI, more
AI companies are showing real revenue.""
After reaching a record high $97.5 billion in the fourth
quarter of 2021, U.S. VC funding had been steadily declining. It
hit a recent low of $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023,
amid a high interest-rate environment and a sluggish exit
market.
The recent influx of capital into AI startups has reversed the
downward trend, prompting more investors to double down on AI
foundation model companies as well as applications from code
generation to productivity tools.
Despite the increase in deal activity, exits remain
challenging, the data shows, as small deals generated about
$23.6 billion in exit value in the second quarter this year,
down from $37.8 billion in the first quarter. The initial public
offering market has struggled to gain momentum, even after some
VC-backed companies, such as cloud data management company
Rubrik, went public.
""For VC returns to see an increase, large tech companies
must begin to list publicly at a higher pace than we have seen
through the first half of the year,"" Pitchbook analyst Kyle
Stanford said in a statement.
Emerging VC fund managers may have already felt the pressure
of a lack of proven returns, with only $37.4 billion in
commitments raised through the first half of the year. Large
firms dominated the fundraising, with Andreessen Horowitz alone
closing new funds with more than $7 billion.

a significant discount in a planned sale of shares in bailed-out
Uniper, two people familiar with the matter said,
adding that the group's current market valuation was no reliable
indicator.
A sale of government holdings in the utility could become
one of Germany's biggest deals next year and rake in badly
needed funds for the country's three-way coalition.
Following years of heavy spending in response to the COVID
and energy crises, Germany's budget suffered a further setback
last year when the country's constitutional court blocked the
re-purposing of funds, causing frictions within the coalition.
Berlin is preparing the sale of around 20-30% in Uniper,
likely in spring 2025, to pare back its holding acquired as part
of the company's nationalisation in the wake of Europe's energy
crisis, the people said.
Uniper and the Finance Ministry, which oversees the German
government's stake in Uniper, both declined to comment.
Uniper's current share price of around 45 euros values the
government's 99.12% stake at 18.5 billion euros ($19.9 billion),
but that valuation is inflated by its tiny free float of 0.88%,
which means the group's stock is barely traded, the sources
said.
An additional reason for the inflated share price could be
minority shareholders who held out for a squeeze-out when the
government stepped in around two years ago, they said, adding
Citi had been hired as part of the sales process.
To successfully place a minority stake with investors, the
government may have to value Uniper at 10 billion euros or less,
one of the people said, which would represent a 46% discount to
current levels.
In total, the German government pumped 13.5 billion euros
into Uniper to save what was then Germany's biggest importer of
Russian gas from collapse, making it one of the country's
biggest ever bailouts.
Berlin may be willing to accept a steep discount in a first
sale, hoping to fetch higher prices in subsequent stake
disposals and also relying on Uniper restarting dividend
payements at some stage, the sources said.
Under European Union rules, the German government must
reduce its holding in Uniper to at least 25% by the end of 2028.
Uniper shares are already down more than a quarter so far
this year, in what sources said reflects anticipation of the
share sale and subsequent value adjustments.
Uniper Chief Executive Michael Lewis, too, in February
acknowledged that not enough Uniper shares were traded and the
government had to sell more to arrive at a clearer valuation.
Details on the planned stake sale and the timing are not
final and still subject to change, the people said. Bringing in
a new anchor shareholder remained an option if markets for
listings continue to be subdued, the said.

Northvolt has for years been considered a pioneer in battery cell production in Europe, at a time when many carmakers and other manufacturers are looking to source batteries away from China. In recent months, however, the company has suffered a series of difficulties and on Tuesday reported a $1.2 billion annual loss in 2023, widening from a $285 million loss in 2022.
Last month Northvolt said it was reviewing its plans to build a second Swedish gigafactory, while German premium carmaker BMW said it had cancelled a 2 billion euro ($2.15 billion)order for battery cells with the company.
Its chairperson also recently left due to health problems.
""A strategic review is underway at Northvolt, to be concluded in the autumn, involving evaluation of timelines and capital allocation to ensure we are pursuing the most effective build-out of capacity possible,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday.
Chief Executive Peter Carlsson said in an interview with business daily Dagens Industri published on Tuesday that Northvolt - which has raised billions of dollars and is exploring an initial public offering of its shares - would consider putting the brakes on planned plants in Heide in Germany and Montreal in Canada.
""We have been a little too aggressive in our expansion plans and that is what we are now reviewing,"" Carlsson told the paper.
Northvolt's first factory in Skelleftea, Sweden, has not yet reached its full production capacity, and a planned increase in output is behind schedule. The company now expects the facility to reach full capacity in 2026.
""We need to reassess subsequent steps, and that is currently in progress ... In order to move forward in Germany and Montreal, it's fundamental we've made Skelleftea the parent plant on which the plan is based,"" Carlsson said.
Northvolt reported that its net sales rose slightly last year to $128 million from $107 million in 2022.

22,Indian whisky maker Allied Blenders up 13% in debut trade,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UNITED-SPIRITS-LIMITED-45456076/news/Indian-whisky-maker-Allied-Blenders-up-13-in-debut-trade-47281634/,UNITDSPR,Jul. 02,Reuters,"BENGALURU, July 2 (Reuters) - Shares of Allied Blenders
and Distillers rose nearly 13% in debut trade on
Tuesday, in line with analysts' expectations for the Indian
whisky manufacturer, which makes the 'Officer's Choice' and
'Sterling Reserve' brands of whiskies.
The stock listed at 320 rupees on the National Stock
Exchange, a 14% premium to its offer price of 281 rupees, before
surrendering some gains. The benchmark Nifty 50 was
flat.
India's $33 billion spirits market is crowded, currently
dominated by Diageo-owned United Spirits and France's Pernod
Ricard, which makes the popular 'Chivas Regal' whisky.
Allied Blenders' listing valued the company at 77.38 billion
rupees (nearly $927 million). United Spirits, which makes the
'Johnnie Walker' brand of whisky, is the larger rival, valued at
$11 billion.
Even if the shares listed at a premium, the valuations will
not sustain as the stock is highly overvalued, analysts said.
Allied's price-to-earnings ratio of 4,014 is way ahead of
its larger peers United Spirits and Radico Khaitan
with P/E ratios at 73 and 96, respectively.
The premium listing is because there is liquidity in the
market and investors are looking for new stock ideas, said Karan
Taurani of Elara Capital.
The company's initial public offering, at 23 times the
shares on offer, was also significantly lower than recent IPOs
in June which were oversubscribed by around a hundred times.
The absence of big names as part of anchor investors in the
offering and stretched valuations were among the reasons for a
subdued response to the IPO, said Kranthi Bathini, director of
equity strategy at Wealthmills.

Keith Gill, the meme stock trader ""Roaring Kitty,"" thrust
Chewy Inc into the spotlight when he made a $245
million bet on the online pet products retailer on Monday.
What is Chewy and why has it attracted Gill's interest?
WHAT'S THE BUSINESS?
Chewy is an $11 billion e-commerce retailer that offers
about 115,000 pet products, including food, beds, litter and
vitamins to U.S. customers through its websites and mobile app.
Their $9.99-a-month subscription plan, which targets dog and cat
owners, has been a key driver of their business.
It sells products under brands including A Pet Hub, Bark and
Slumber, and Nutro, and its market capitalization stands at
$11.87 billion, according to LSEG data.
By marketing its products to a narrow group of shoppers -
pet owners - Chewy has been able to keep its marketing costs and
inventory levels low, enabling it to grow its profit margins
over the years.
The company reported net sales of $11.15 billion and
merchandise margins of 28.4% for its fiscal year ended on Jan.
28, 2024.
Chewy competes with the likes of Amazon.com and
Etsy, which also sell pet products online, in addition
to Petco Health and Wellness, which operates over 1,500
stores in the United States.
WHAT'S CHEWY'S HISTORY?
GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen and Michael Day founded
Chewy in 2011. They then sold the business to larger rival
PetSmart for $3.35 billion in 2017, the largest acquisition of
an e-commerce website at the time.
Two years later, PetSmart sold most of its Chewy shares in
an IPO, in part to trim the debt it had amassed as part of its
acquisition of the company. Chewy began trading on the New York
Stock Exchange at a $36 share price on June 14, 2019.
Chewy's shares peaked at nearly $119 in early 2021, as
Americans adopted pets during the pandemic and spent lavishly to
care for them.
Chewy is chaired by BC Partners' Raymond Svider. The private
equity firm continues to own around 68.6% of Chewy following its
IPO, representing 95.6% of the voting power, it disclosed in a
May 24 proxy statement.
BC Partners is also a majority shareholder of PetSmart.
WHY IS ROARING KITTY INTERESTED IN CHEWY?
Gill said on Monday that he had amassed a 6.6% stake in the
company valued at $245 million, which analysts said was partly
influenced by the fact that the retailer was founded by
GameStop's Cohen.
Gill has called Cohen ""the man"" and brilliant in the past.
His stake makes him the third largest shareholder, based on
the ownership disclosures in Chewy's proxy statement.
Gill's Reddit posts championing GameStop in 2021
fueled a nearly 700% rise in the video game retailer's shares in
2021.
HOW HAS CHEWY'S STOCK FARED?
Chewy's stock has been volatile since Gill posted an
uncaptioned picture of a puppy on social media platform X that
resembled Chewy's logo and sent its shares to a near one-year
high on Thursday.
But including Monday's trading, Chewy's shares have lost 13%
since Thursday's tweet.
The stock is also highly shorted, with 15.7% of its
free-float shares in short position, as of June 27, according to
Ortex Technologies, an analytics firm. By comparison, about 0.9%
of Amazon's free float are shorted.

file for an initial public offering in the United States, the
holding company for the Colombian airline said on Monday.
The airline is moving ahead with its listing more than two
years after it emerged from bankruptcy.
Bogota-based Avianca was one of the major Latin American
airlines that filed for bankruptcy during the pandemic, hurt by
a downturn in travel demand.
The airline, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
May 2020 after it failed to meet a bond payment deadline, exited
bankruptcy proceedings in December 2021.
The timing and execution of the offering are subject to
market conditions, the airline said.
Avianca's total operating revenue came in at $1.27 billion
in the first quarter, up from $1.09 billion a year earlier.
The airline also swung to a profit of $13 million in the
same period, compared to a loss of $12 million in 2022.
Avianca's fleet comprised of 128 Airbus 320 family aircraft
and 13 Boeing 787s as of March end.
The company is the latest Latin American airline seeking to
tap into the deeper capital and richer valuations that the U.S.
markets offer.
Earlier this year, Mexico City-based AeromÃ©xico also filed
its paperwork to go public in New York as it eyes a return to
stock markets.
Chile's LATAM Airlines is also working on re-listing its
shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

on Monday, approved baby products retailer FirstCry's filing for
an initial public offering at the second time of asking, after
having raised doubts over certain aspects in the first
submission.
FirstCry, backed by Softbank, TPG and Mahindra and Mahindra,
sells baby products such as clothes, diapers and toys, and is
seeking to tap the market for new parents in the world's most
populous country, amid a booming IPO market.
It first filed IPO papers, which Reuters reported was for up
to $500 million, with the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI) last December.
But SEBI told the company that it had not complied with
regulations that mandate an IPO-bound company must audit and
disclose all key metrics that it has shared with prospective
investors in the last three years, Reuters had reported.
FirstCry latest filing, on June 28th, did not elaborate on
the questions that were raised, nor did it disclose how much the
IPO would be worth.
The number of Indian companies looking to go public has
surged this year, looking to tap into investor demand as the
equity market scales fresh records regularly.
A total of 129 companies have raised raising $4.32 billion
in IPOs this year through Friday, more than double the amount
raised last year, according to LSEG data.
During its first filing, FirstCry said it would use the IPO
funds to expand its network in India and Saudi Arabia and to
clear leases for existing Indian stores, totaling 936 at the
time.
Its losses surged six-fold to $57.6 million in the year
ended March 31, 2023, while its total income more than doubled
to $684 million, the papers showed.
Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Morgan Stanley, Bofa
Securities and JM Financial are among the bookrunners of the
IPO.

Becher will officially assume the position on 25 July, 2024 the day after the publication of Kambi?s Second Quarter 2024 report. Following a thorough search and selection process comprised of a strong pool of candidates, Becher has been assigned to lead Kambi into its next phase of growth, having previously held senior positions within the sports betting industry, both in B2B and B2C companies, alongside earlier experience gained in the technology sector. Becher was a key figure at global sports data and betting supplier Sportradar for four years from 2019, initially as Managing Director of its US-facing Betting arm before assuming the position of CEO of its Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America business.
Becher played a pivotal role in the successful Nasdaq IPO of Sportradar in September 2021. Becher was previously CEO of European betting and gaming operator Interwetten for eight years, where he led the company through a period of sustained growth. Most recently, Becher served as an independent investor and advisor.
On joining Kambi, Becher will be tasked with building on the Company?s success and its position of the industry?s leading sports betting partner. Kambi recently embarked on a modularisation strategy which has seen it open up its platform, incubate its AI-pricing division, Tzeract, and acquire highly complementary businesses in Abios and Shape Games. The hire of Becher comes after Kambi co-founder NylÃ©n announced in January he would, upon the appointment of a successor, step down from the position he has held since 2010.
In May, NylÃ©n was elected to the Kambi Board of Directors at the Company?s Annual General Meeting. NylÃ©n will provide ongoing support to Becher to ensure a seamless handover."

The Company announces the signing of a new ?200 million Eurobond facility (""New Eurobond""), which will refinance the existing ?200 million Eurobond (""Original Eurobond"") signed by the Company's indirect subsidiary Cordiant Digital Holdings Two Limited in June 2022. This refinancing provides greater certainty and flexibility for the group by extending the maturity of CORD's holding company-level term debt from September 2026 to July 2029, with a bullet repayment structure.
The Company is also to make full repayment of the circa ?30 million vendor loan note issued as part of the acquisition of Speed Fibre, which completed in October 2023. The repayment will be made from existing cash resources and will provide the Company greater flexibility as it takes forward its growth plans for Speed Fibre. As part of the refinancing, the Company has also arranged additional complementary undrawn credit facilities totalling ?175 million, split between a growth capex facility (""Capex Facility"") of ?105 million and a multi-currency revolving credit facility (""RCF"") of ?70 million.
These additional facilities have the same maturity date and repayment structure as the New Eurobond and provide the Company with an incremental long-term funding commitment for growth investments under CORD's Buy, Build & Grow model, and can enable more efficient management of the group's balance sheet. The new facilities (""New Facilities"") were significantly oversubscribed and are being provided by a consortium of blue-chip institutions comprising investment banks DNB and Nomura, and funds managed/and or advised by Schroders Capital, UBS Asset Management, Infranity (formerly Generali Global Infrastructure), IFM Investors, and PATRIZIA. The New Facilities will be issued by Cordiant Digital Holdings UK Limited, the Company's wholly owned, direct subsidiary that is the holding company for the Company's portfolio companies in Europe.
The terms on the New Eurobond represent an improvement on the Original Eurobond, with a longer tenor and improved credit margin rachet, which will range from 3.75% to 4.75% over EURIBOR or the 5-year EURIBOR swap rate, depending on net leverage. Three quarters of the New Eurobond will be issued as a fixed rate instrument, with the remaining amount to be floating rate in nature. Both the Capex Facility and the RCF will be floating rate facilities.
The Company is putting in place interest rate hedging lines to manage its variable rate exposure and ensure that it is well positioned to take advantage of any further future reductions in long-term interest rates. Closing of the New Facilities remains subject to the satisfaction of a small number of administrative conditions precedent and is expected to occur shortly, The Company's net gearing ratio was 38.9% as at 31 March 2024. On a pro forma basis, if all the New Facilities are fully drawn, the Company's net gearing ratio would be 44%, below the 50% limit set out in the Company's IPO prospectus.
On the same pro forma basis, the weighted average margin across the whole portfolio would increase slightly to 3.3% from 2.9%. The Company's total available liquidity disclosed as at 31 March 2024, pro forma for this refinancing, would have increased to Â£291 million from Â£168 million."

The British bank explains that the transaction is in line with the strategy it presented at its Investor Day in February, aimed at focusing primarily on its private banking, corporate and investment banking businesses.

At March 31, the division had assets of around 4.7 billion euros.
Barclays points out that the transaction will free up capital requirements in the form of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) of around four billion euros, and improve its CET1 capital ratio by around 0.1 percentage points.

supervisor has put UBS under observation following its
takeover of Credit Suisse, the regulator said on Thursday.
The supervisor met with financial market regulator FINMA,
competition authority ComCo and the Swiss National Bank to
discuss consequences of the takeover, it said.
The meeting laid down the groundwork for necessary
cooperation between the different authorities in future, they
said.
UBS on Monday said it has completed the merger of its
domestic unit with Credit Suisse's operations in its home
market.
The lender did not immediately respond to a request for
comment on Thursday.
FINMA last month ruled that the takeover did not create any
competition concerns, despite recommendations from ComCo that it
merited further scrutiny.
""ComCo's analysis has shown that the merged UBS now has
market power or dominance in some markets,"" the pricing
supervisor's office said.
""This means that the price supervisor is directly
responsible for monitoring price abuse in these markets,"" it
added.
The supervisor said it was looking in particular at loan
interest rates. Swiss businesses have raised
concerns
that the market power of the enlarged UBS could lead to
higher loan costs in future.
""The price supervisor assumes that the merged major bank
is aware of its social responsibility and will behave
accordingly,"" the office said.
The office said it hoped that regulatory interventions
will not be needed but would not hesitate to act if necessary.

Shares in Barclays rose 1.4% to 221.10 pence in London on Thursday.
The London-based lender did not disclose financial details of the transaction but said Bawag will pay a small premium to net assets, payable in cash on completion.
As at March 31, Consumer Bank Europe had gross assets of EUR4.7 billion, primarily comprising card and loan receivables, Barclays said.
Consumer Bank Europe is a diversified retail banking business, with established credit card, consumer loan and deposit franchises serving customers in the German and Austrian markets.
Barclays said the disposal, through its Irish arm Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, would release around EUR4.0 billion of risk weighted assets, increasing Barclays' CET1 ratio by around 10 basis points on completion.
Completion of the sale is expected to occur within six to nine months. The timing of completion does not impact Barclays' previously announced capital return plans, the company added.
Barclays Europe Chief Executive Francesco Ceccato said: ""The sale of Consumer Bank Europe aligns with our ambition to simplify Barclays. In BAWAG, we believe we have found a strong and committed owner for the business' journey forwards.
""This transaction will also allow Barclays Europe to focus on its Corporate and Investment Banking and Private Banking businesses. We remain committed to our broader German and European operations and look forward to continued growth in the region during 2024 and beyond.""
Barclays said the deal was another example of disciplined execution against the plan presented earlier this year.
In February, Barclays announced an operational overhaul, including substantial cost cuts, asset sales and a reorganization of its business divisions, while promising to return GBP10 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026 through dividends and share buybacks.

The two countries are trading partners and should therefore expand business relations in the interests of both sides, said a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Thursday. China hopes that Germany will create a fair competitive environment for everyone, including China.
The Federal Cabinet had prohibited the planned sale to the Chinese CSIC Longjiang GH Gas Turbine Co (GHGT) with reference to the Foreign Trade and Payments Act. It feared that China could use the gas turbines not only for civilian purposes, but also to power warships. GHGT is part of the China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC), which also builds ships for the Chinese navy. Under the Foreign Trade and Payments Act, the German government can prohibit sales to non-EU countries if they could jeopardize national security. Following the veto, MAN Energy announced that it would discontinue the construction and development of gas turbines. However, profitable maintenance is to be retained. The MAN Energy division has a total of 100 employees in Oberhausen and Zurich.

Dubbed as one of its largest deals in history, Ericsson splurged $6.2 billion in cash to buy Vonage to help it target enterprise customers as it sought to diversify away from its mobile networks business.
Since then, mobile network revenue has fallen due to lower demand for 5G gear, Ericsson's share price has halved over an Iraq bribing scandal, and it took a $3 billion non-cash charge last year on the Vonage deal.
""Given deterioration in the market environment and elective decisions we have made to refocus our investments in strategically prioritized areas, we have reassessed certain growth assumptions, resulting in a non-cash impairment of 11.4 billion Swedish crowns ($1.1 billion),"" said Vonage CEO Niklas Heuveldop, who got the top job in February.
Vonage is run as an independent unit of Ericsson.
Ericsson had expected Vonage to boost earnings per share and free cash flow from 2024 onwards, but so far it has written down $4 billion or about two-thirds off the purchase price.
Ericsson paid $21 for each outstanding Vonage share, a 28% premium to the previous closing price of the stock and a 34% premium to the average of the last three months, a price analysts said at that time was high.
""This confirms the thesis of Ericsson having significantly overpaid for the unit in 2021,"" said Mads Lindegaard Rosendal, analyst at Danske Bank Credit Research.

Barclays agreed to sell its German consumer finance business to a subsidiary of Austrian bank Bawag Group as it continues with its plan to simplify its business.
The British lender on Thursday said that its Hamburg-based Consumer Bank Europe--which offers diversified retail banking services to the German and Austrian markets--will be bought for a small premium to net assets which will be paid in cash when the deal closes.
Barclays Consumer Bank Europe had 4.7 billion euros ($5.07 billion) in gross assets, mostly from card and loan receivables, as of March 31, it said.
The sale should release around EUR4.0 billion in risk-weighed assets and raise Barclays' common equity Tier 1 ratio--a measure of capital strength--by around 10 basis points on the deal's completion, which is expected within six to nine months, subject to approvals.
For Bawag, the transaction is expected to represent a pretax profit contribution of more than EUR100 million in 2027 after the unit is integrated, the Austrian group said in a separate statement.

consider raising its stake in Italy's ITA Airways to 90%,
starting from early next year, the CEO of the German airline
said in an interview published on Thursday.
Carsten Spohr was speaking after his company won EU
antitrust approval to buy 41% of state-owned ITA for 325 million
euros ($350 million).
""For us, the option for the 90% starts in early 2025,"" Spohr
told Italy's Corriere della Sera, adding that he would like the
Italian government to retain a stake in ITA.
When Lufthansa agreed its 41% deal with Rome's authorities
last year, it said it was looking to acquire full control of ITA
""at a later date.""
In a separate interview with Il Sole 24 Ore daily, ITA
Chairman Antonino Turicchi said the closing of the deal for
Lufthansa's initial investment would take place in November,
adding that Lufthansa would have the possibility of raising its
stake to 90% ""one year after the closing.""
Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said on
Wednesday that his government wanted to maintain some oversight
on ITA to protect national interests.
In Thursday's Corriere della Sera, Spohr said he would like
to retain ""the support"" of the Italian government for the first
two years of Lufthansa's involvement in ITA. ""Then we will
discuss together what to do,"" he added.
Spohr declined to say who will be appointed as ITA's new CEO
after Italian press reports suggested that Joerg Eberhart,
Lufthansa's head of strategy and former boss of Air Dolomiti,
would get the job.

SYDNEY--Amazon's cloud-computing business will build a top-secret cloud for Australia's government, improving the key U.S. ally's ability to share and analyze information and boost the resilience of its defense communications.
Australia said it will invest at least 2 billion Australian dollars, or US$1.3 billion, over the next decade in establishing and operating the top-secret cloud. The deal involves a strategic partnership between the Australian Signals Directorate, the intelligence service in charge of cybersecurity, and Amazon Web Services.
The top-secret cloud ""will provide a state-of-the-art collaborative space for our intelligence and defense community to store and access top-secret data,"" said Rachel Noble, director general of the ASD. ""This will transform how we work together as agencies and partners.""
The cloud will support deeper collaboration with the U.S. and support Australian military operations while harnessing new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, the government said.
Australian government entities and companies have been the target of several high-profile cyberattacks in recent years, including one in 2019 that targeted the nation's Parliament. Cybersecurity professionals have been worried that cyberattacks are rising globally and stretching resources.
Although it can be difficult to ascertain who is behind such attacks, U.S. officials believe China is the most active and persistent cyber threat to the government, private sector and critical infrastructure. Beijing has denied being involved in cyberattacks.
U.S. tech companies have seen a significant business opportunity in Australia, which has had a rocky diplomatic relationship with China in recent years despite Beijing being its largest trading partner.
Microsoft in October said it would invest A$5 billion over the next two years in Australia to expand its cloud-computing and AI infrastructure while also partnering with the ASD. Amazon Web Services also previously said it would invest an additional A$13.2 billion in the country.

Nissan and Honda representatives did not immediately respond

SYDNEY--Stockland and Supalai Australia Holdings' proposed acquisition of 12 residential masterplanned communities from Lendlease for 1.3 billion Australian dollars (US$872 million) could raise prices for prospective homeowners, Australia's competition regulator said.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Thursday said that it had preliminary concerns over the proposed deal, which was announced in December 2023.
The proposal would remove one of Stockland's closest and largest competitors in four regions, ACCC Commissioner Liza Carver said.
""The proposed acquisition may increase Stockland's incentive to raise the price, delay the supply, or reduce the quality of housing lots in these regions, to the detriment of prospective homeowners,"" Carver said.
Stockland said that it and Supalai would engage with the ACCC to address its preliminary concerns ahead of an expected final decision on approval on Sept. 12. The transaction also needs approval from Australia's foreign-investment regulator.
Lendlease announced the divestment of the communities as part of its strategic pivot toward becoming a real-estate asset manager.

regulator has approved two key onshore assets sale by
international oil companies, clearing the way for Oando and new
entrant Project Odinmim, to acquire assets, the head of the
agency, Gbenga Komolafe, said on Wednesday.
Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC)
greenlit deals by Eni's local unit Nigerian Agip Oil
Company (NAOC) to Oando and Equinor to
Project Odinmim, Komolafe announced at an energy conference in
Abuja, the capital.
The deals had been pending for months as they required
sign-off from the petroleum minister under a recently enacted
oil industry law. Approvals for Exxon Mobil's $1.3 billion asset
sale to Seplat and Shell's divestment to Renaissance remain
pending.
""The signing ceremony will be conducted in the next few
days,"" Komolafe said.
Eni had previously announced the sale of its NAOC subsidiary
to Oando in September. The deal included interests in four
onshore oil mining leases (OML) 60, 61, 62, and 63.
However, Ainojie Alex Irune, Oando's CEO, hinted at further
complexities in the deals during the conference.
""We had four transactions; two were approved, one on a
yellow flag and the other in abeyance,"" he said.
The NUPRC chief did not elaborate on the specific OMLs
approved for Oando, and Irune did not provide further details.
Oil majors operating in Nigeria have been exiting their
onshore fields hampered by theft, vandalism and pollution to
focus on deepwater explorations.
In May, the NUPRC offered faster approvals for pending asset
sales by the majors if they took responsibility for spills and
compensated communities rather than wait for authorities to
apportion liability, which could lead to further delay deals.

July 4 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company (ADNOC) have been separately considering
bids for Santos, Bloomberg News reported, sending
shares of the Australian gas producer up 6.5% on Thursday.
Both Saudi Aramco and ADNOC have been conducting preliminary
evaluations of Santos as a possible acquisition target, the
report said, citing sources who declined to be named as the
information was private.
The sources said Santos could attract interest from other
potential buyers, according to the report. Deliberations are on,
and the suitors have not decided whether to proceed with any
proposals, it added.
""Santos does not comment on media speculation,"" a company
spokesperson said.
Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to Reuters' request
for comment, while ADNOC declined to comment.
Santos shares rose to a high of A$8.18 and last traded up 5%
at A$8.09, outpacing a 1% rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX200
.
Adelaide-based Santos had a market capitalisation of $16.63
billion as of Wednesday's close, up 1% since the start of the
year.
Santos, with assets stretching across Australia to Alaska
and Papua New Guinea (PNG), has been eyed by suitors over the
past several years for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business,
especially its stake in PNG LNG.
The company produced 91.7 million barrels of oil equivalent
(mmboe) last year and had proven plus probable reserves of 1,661
mmboe as of the end of last year.
Its biggest development project is the Barossa gas project
in waters off northwestern Australia, which has faced delays and
cost increases following court fights with an Indigenous group
over the planned route for a gas pipeline from the field.
DOUBTS ON A DEAL
A Santos shareholder and an analyst both played down the
likelihood of an offer from Aramco or ADNOC.
""I think Santos is an attractively priced company with a
handful of great assets, but despite this, I find it hard to
imagine a would-be buyer flagging its interest prior to making
an offer,"" said Simon Mawhinney, managing director of fund
manager Allan Gray.
""So Iâ€™m inclined not to put too much, if any, weight on
these reports and happily be proven wrong on this point.""
MST Financial senior analyst Saul Kavonic said Aramco and
ADNOC have been looking at a number of LNG opportunities but
Santos would be ""a big step out of their comfort zone,""
politically, operationally and by size.
Australia's Woodside Energy held preliminary talks
with Santos earlier this year to form a $52 billion energy
giant, however discussions collapsed, and Santos said it would
continue to review options to unlock value for its shareholders.
""Santos has been shopping itself for a while, so there could
be quite a few players out there who have pursued preliminary
assessments,"" Kavonic said, adding that Santos' domestic assets
might be an obstacle to any buyout.
""We remain of the view that a bid for Santos at a material
premium is unlikely to emerge, despite Santos shopping itself
for some time,"" he said.

agreed to acquire Varsity Brands, a U.S. maker of sports
uniforms and school yearbooks, from buyout firm Bain Capital for
about $4.75 billion, including debt, people familiar with the
matter said on Wednesday.
KKR will own Varsity Brands through its Americas private
equity fund, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the
deal has not yet been announced.
KKR has committed to offering rank-and-file employees of its
North America portfolio companies equity in these companies, and
will do so with Varsity Brands, the sources said. This is an
incentive the corporate world traditionally reserves for senior
executives.
KKR, Bain Capital and Varsity Brands declined to
comment.
Bain acquired Varsity Brands in 2018 from private equity
firms Charlesbank Capital Partners and Partners Group for around
$2.5 billion. Reuters reported last year that Bain was exploring
a sale or initial public offering of Varsity Brands.
Varsity Brands consists of two main businesses, BSN SPORTS
and Varsity Spirit. BSN distributes customizable team sports
equipment and apparel through partnerships with brands including
Nike and Under Armor.
Varsity Spirit sells cheerleader uniforms and apparel, and
also hosts educational camps, clinics and competitions. It also
makes school yearbooks, which used to be part of Varsity's Herff
Jones graduation merchandise division.
Varsity kept the yearbooks business when it sold Herff Jones
to private equity firm Atlas Holdings last year.
The deal comes as buyout firms have been actively pursuing
deals with sports apparel businesses, which typically generate
steady returns for investors due to their predictable cash
flows.
ACON Investments is preparing to take U.S. sports league
headwear company New Era Cap public, Reuters has previously
reported.
Earlier this year, Platinum Equity acquired sports uniform
companies Augusta Sportswear and Founder Sport Group.

For months, Paramount?s controlling shareholder and Skydance sought to seal a merger that would transform the media industry, before those talks ground to a sudden halt in June. Now, just weeks later, the two sides have reached a preliminary deal to merge, four people familiar with the negotiations said.
The agreement will still have to be approved by a special committee of Paramount?s board of directors, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the talks resumed. If they win that approval, the deal will combine Paramount - the parent company of CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon - and Skydance, the up-and-coming movie studio that helped produce ?Top Gun: Maverick,? into a new giant in Hollywood.
An agreement would be a changing of the guard in the media world, as legacy companies like Paramount struggle with the decline of cable TV and with streaming services that bleed cash. Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount through her stake in its parent company, National Amusements, is part of the family that has run the media conglomerate for decades. The new company would be backed instead by big-ticket investors like the private-equity firm RedBird and David Ellison, son of the Oracle founder Larry Ellison.
It would also end a dramatic saga that has played out over months. Paramount and Skydance entered into exclusive negotiations in April only to let them lapse in May without striking an agreement. Their talks continued, even as other suitors emerged.
The two finally seemed to be headed toward a deal in June after a marathon weekend of negotiating. But just as Paramount?s special committee was set to vote on that deal, lawyers for National Amusements emailed Paramount?s special committee to end the discussions. In the weeks that followed, Paramount outlined what a stand-alone future might look like for the company as it navigated a challenging media landscape.
It appointed three executives to succeed Bob Bakish, who stepped down as chief executive in April, through a joint ?office of the C.E.O.? role. They said in a recent shareholder meeting that they planned to explore a streaming joint venture and cut $500 million in costs as the media giant grappled with about $14 billion in debt.
The company?s shares have fallen more than 16% over the past month, as Paramount?s investors have remained concerned about its prospects. Paramount has been exploring a deal despite strong headwinds to traditional media. Critics have argued that the company was too late to streaming, leaving it undersized and lagging behind its rivals.
They also point to missed opportunities, such as when Mr. Bakish balked at selling trophy assets like Showtime and BET to suitors offering billions in recent months. Skydance and National Amusements resumed their negotiations not long after a cooling-off period, three of the people said. This latest deal would give Ms. Redstone better financial terms than the previous iteration.
National Amusements? equity would be valued at $1.75 billion, up slightly from $1.7 billion in the last incarnation, three of the people said. The deal would also give National Amusements a greater degree of protection against potential shareholder lawsuits over the deal.
That had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations, given significant shareholder angst about the transaction. The deal is expected to offer Paramount a 45-day ?go shop? period in which it can talk to other suitors about a potential deal, three of the sources said.
The billionaire Barry Diller and his digital media conglomerate, IAC, have expressed interest in National Amusements, as has Edgar Bronfman Jr., the media and finance executive, and Steven Paul, the Hollywood executive best known for his work on the ?Baby Geniuses? franchise. The Paramount board committee will now evaluate whether those new terms will be sufficiently palatable for shareholders."

2024
* Energy savings and future price stability are key
incentives
* Large rooftop solar subsidies tender bids up 107% y/y
BERLIN, July 2 (Reuters) - For months, Philip Matthias
tried to convince his father to install solar panels on their
company's roof in the eastern German state of Thuringia, aiming
to cut electricity costs and carbon emissions at the metal
products factory.
Initially sceptical of the 2.3-million-euro ($2.5 million)
investment, a substantial sum for the medium-sized Tridelta, his
father crunched the numbers and decided to nearly double the
project capacity, opting to install photovoltaic modules that
could power around 900 households in addition to the factory.
""The PV systems amortize after about 7-1/2 years. The
manufacturer gives a guarantee of 20 years. That means this is
an extremely lucrative investment,"" Matthias told Reuters.
Since the war in Ukraine and the sudden drop in Russia
fossil fuel exports to Germany, Berlin has introduced laws to
accelerate solar power expansion, part of its plan to cover 80%
of the country's energy from renewables by 2030.
Encouraged by a feed-in tariff providing a guaranteed price
to renewable energy producers selling their power, as well as
reduced solar panel costs, German companies are increasingly
turning to solar to get around high energy costs.
Although Germany has Europe's biggest capacity of solar and
wind power generation, its small and medium-sized companies have
yet to benefit from lower electricity prices because of high
grid fees and taxes they must pay. By generating their own solar
power, they avoid those fees and taxes.
Companies consumed around 69% of Germany's national
electricity in 2023, data by the BDEW utilities association
showed.
""As electricity prices in Germany show no signs of
decreasing as previously anticipated, companies are increasingly
recognising the economic viability of installing solar panels,""
said Marie-Theres Husken, an energy expert for the BVMW
association for small- and medium-sized businesses.
CORPORATE SOLAR SHIFT
Newly installed photovoltaic capacity on business rooftops
rose by 81% year-on-year in the first four months of the year,
outpacing the 1% growth in the residential sector, data by the
BSW solar power association shows.
A May survey by pollster YouGov showed more than half of
German companies with suitable roofs planned to install solar
power systems in the next three years. BVMW forecasts that
nearly all manufacturing companies in Germany will use solar
energy by 2030.
In response to increasing demand, Germany's largest
residential solar power developer, Enpal, said in April it was
expanding into the commercial sector.
""The demand was not as instant... but the growth is going to
be very sustainable,"" Melchior Schulze Brock, CEO of commercial
and industrial solar startup Enviria.
An April study by the Freiburg-based Institute for Applied
Ecology showed there was potential to install up to 287
gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, more than enough to meet
Berlin's 2030 target of 215 GW, along German roads, railways,
parking lots, and industrial areas. This could significantly
reduce reliance on agricultural land where permitting and
planning approvals can take up to a decade.
A drop in solar panel prices globally since last year has
spurred companies to embrace solar energy.
""The market is overrun with cheap but good panels from
China. That means that the system that we are building now is
about 20% cheaper than a year ago,"" Matthias said.
A German legislative package passed in April easing
regulation and increasing subsidies for large rooftop systems as
well as a pending tax investment reform for real estate funds
operating rooftop solar panels, is expected to drive demand
further.
State feed-in subsidies for large scale rooftop photovoltaic
projects, introduced in 2021 and which are selected via tender,
have also boosted the trend.
The last tender for the subsidised projects in February saw
a 107% rise in the number of offers year-on-year, data by the
federal grid network agency showed.
A feed-in tariff of 9.3 euros cents per kilowatt-hour,
higher than Tridelta's power purchasing price, makes it
currently cheaper for the company to sell future generated
electricity to the grid and buy it back, Matthias said.
Germany's economy ministry declined to comment on companies'
electricity trading strategies.
""There's a high correlation between the feed-in tariffs and
the build-up of solar PV roof top projects,"" Hugo Willink,
Executive Director at solar roofs developer Sunrock told
Reuters.
Sunrock, which won an order from Mercedes Benz in May to
build a 23-megawatt solar project on the carmaker's factory
roofs, sees Germany as its core market for the coming year.

11,Record: 58 percent of electricity from renewable energies,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/EON-SE-3818998/news/Record-58-percent-of-electricity-from-renewable-energies-47273347/,EOAN,Jun. 30,dpa-AFX,"BERLIN/STUTTGART (dpa-AFX) - New half-year record for electricity generation from renewable energies: Electricity from wind, sunlight, biomass and hydropower covered around 58 percent of electricity consumption in Germany in the first half of 2024.
This is according to projections by the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (ZSW) and the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), which were made available to dpa on Monday.
In the first half of 2023, the share of renewable energies was still 52 percent. Gross domestic electricity consumption totaled 261 billion kilowatt hours and was therefore 0.3 percent below the previous year's figure.
More than half from renewables
In the first half of the year, renewable energies covered more than half of monthly electricity consumption each month, emphasized the BDEW. Since April, they have had a monthly share of 59 percent.
""Photovoltaic systems in particular produced a total of 37 billion kilowatt hours, significantly more electricity than in the previous year - also thanks to the record expansion in 2023,"" the energy industry association noted.
In June 2024, PV systems generated more than 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity within one month for the very first time. Hydropower also made an above-average contribution to electricity generation with 12 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
The majority comes from onshore wind turbines
Of the 58 percent, 24 percentage points came from onshore wind power, 14 percentage points from photovoltaics, 9 percentage points from biomass, 5 percentage points from hydropower, 5 percentage points from offshore wind power and 1 percentage point from electricity generation from municipal waste.
Kerstin Andreae, Chairwoman of the BDEW Executive Board, described the figures as a ""reward for the persistent expansion of wind energy and photovoltaics in recent years"".
Gas-fired power plants necessary as plan B
The construction of hydrogen-capable gas-fired power plants is now important. ""Because despite the pleasing figures: Electricity generation from wind and solar is not constant. We need secure power for system services and times when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing,"" said Andreae.
The record shows that a secure and greenhouse gas-neutral power supply based on almost 100 percent renewable energies, including hydrogen, is achievable by 2035, explained ZSW Board Member Frithjof StaiÃŸ. This provides a stable foundation for the industry on its path to climate-neutral production./tob/DP/zb"
12,"EU's power mix in 2024 the greenest yet, industry data show",https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ELIA-GROUP-NV-SA-5989/news/EU-s-power-mix-in-2024-the-greenest-yet-industry-data-show-47272961/,ELI,Jun. 30,Reuters,"BRUSSELS, July 1 (Reuters) - Three-quarters of the
European Union's electricity has been generated by CO2
emissions-free sources so far this year, making it the bloc's
greenest power mix to date, industry data showed on Monday.
Emissions-free sources produced 74% of EU electricity in
January-June, of which 50% was from renewable sources like wind
and solar, and 24% from nuclear, industry association
Eurelectric said.
""The electricity generation of Europe has never had such a
low-carbon profile before,"" Eurelectric Secretary General
Kristian Ruby told Reuters.
Coal produced 9% of EU electricity and gas 13% - the lowest
shares for each fossil fuel for the same period in any year to
date.
The main driver of Europe's changing energy mix is the rapid
installation of renewable energy capacity. The EU built 56
gigawatts of new solar power capacity in 2023 - the highest in
any year to date - and 16GW of new wind capacity.
However, Europe's electricity demand has also decreased,
making it easier for green sources to cover a bigger share of
the overall mix. EU power demand was 5.8% lower in the first
half of this year than in the same period in 2021.
European energy prices surged to record highs in 2022 after
Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe. The resulting energy
crisis forced industries and consumers to use less energy to
curb their bills - with some industries yet to recover
production to pre-crisis levels, depressing their energy
consumption.
More renewable energy will help Europe meet its climate
targets and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. But there
are signs countries' aging power grids are struggling to cope
with the changing energy mix.
Belgian power grid operator Elia warned last month
that a recent jump in Belgium's solar power capacity will cause
periods of surplus cheap energy this summer, making it harder to
balance the grid.
Ruby urged policymakers to invest in upgrading power grids
to cope with bigger shares of renewable capacity, including by
adding storage capacity to absorb cheap excess power so it
doesn't go to waste.
""We need a physical build-out of the grid with quite a bit
of urgency,"" he said.

This time, it's the area of primary healthcare where the pair is showing some interest in buying businesses. The understanding is that inquiries are being made to gain more knowledge of the space around the market ahead of a potential move into the sector on behalf of the $10 billion Australian listed private health insurer Medibank with Macquarie in tow.
If they are in the market for an acquisition, the obvious place to look is in the backyard of BGH Capital. The Melbourne-based private equity firm backed by Ben Gray, Simon Harle and Robin Bishop, formerly of TPG Capital and Macquarie Group respectively, owns the former primary healthcare unit of Healius. BGH purchased the business in 2020 for $500 million and has since renamed it ForHealth.
BGH has reportedly been gauging views around the market in recent months to assess whether now would be a good time to place the business up for sale. General practice has been a challenging area in the healthcare industry, with a shortage of doctors prepared to take on bulk billing cases as they are unable to make the numbers stack up. But driving a stronger performance this current financial year has been the work it has carried out for the government by providing Medicare Urgent Care Clinics.
It is expected that BGH would want more than $1 billion for ForHealth, which operates more than 80 large-scale, multidisciplinary medical centres, providing critical primary care services, including GPs, dental, specialist, diagnostic imaging, pathology, allied health and pharmacy services."

The latest proposal was made in early June after previously Hipgnosis accepted Blackstone's raised takeover offer worth USD 1.57 billion, abandoning its deal with US music company Concord. Blackstone earlier said that the latest increase in its offer was due to the lower-than-expected adviser fees being incurred by Hipgnosis in relation to the transaction.

The revised offer is also an over 40% premium to the last closing price prior to MNC?s initial offer.
When MNC made its initial bid in mid-February, Vista?s shares were trading below $30 - at that time, the market reflected the acquisition of Kinetic by CSG. On June 25, 2024, Vista shares closed at $33.78 - the shares would have closed significantly lower without the expectation that MNC would be continuing to pursue the acquisition of Vista. MNC?s revised proposal represents a premium of almost 25% to June 25, 2024?s closing price.
Given MNC?s belief that its acquisition of Vista is in the best interests of shareholders, employees and national security, MNC decided to make one final effort for such acquisition by increasing its June 6, 2024 proposal from $39.50 per share all cash to $42.00 per share all cash. MNC said that it cannot see any possible basis or reason to further raise it. MNC?s revised proposal is all cash, has no regulatory issues and is not subject to any financing conditions.
MNC holds secured debt and equity commitments more than sufficient to close the transaction and stands ready to provide those to Vista. MNC expects that the Vista Board will move forward expeditiously to sign a merger agreement on the terms proposed. MNC believes a definitive agreement can be executed in a matter of days."

28,AI stocks to leave big impact on Russell reconstitution,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/NVIDIA-CORPORATION-57355629/news/AI-stocks-to-leave-big-impact-on-Russell-reconstitution-47133066/,NVDA,Jun. 25,Reuters,"NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Investors are gearing up
for the final reconstitution of the benchmark indexes by FTSE
Russell on Friday, with the furious rally in artificial
intelligence (AI) related stocks over the past year expected to
leave an outsized imprint on their final shape.
The Russell Reconstitution, an event that typically results
in one of the busiest trading days of the year, will become
official after the closing bell on Friday and concludes a
multi-step process by FTSE Russell for the annual refresh of its
indexes.
This once-a-year change prompts fund managers to adjust
their portfolios to reflect the new weightings and components.
This refresh encompasses a range of the Russell indexes,
such as the Russell 1000 index of large-cap stocks and
the Russell 2000 index of small-cap names which together
make up the Russell 3000 index. In addition, there are
style indexes such as the Russell 1000 growth and Russell
2000 value indexes.
Since last year's reconstitution, the furious rally in
stocks seen as likely to benefit from AI, names such as Nvidia
and Super Micro Computer, is expected to
significantly impact Russell's growth and value indexes this
year.
Even with a recent slide, Nvidia shares as of Monday have
rallied about 180% from a year ago, while Super Micro has gained
more than 230%. Meta Platforms has jumped nearly 75%
and Microsoft has climbed more than 31%.
The outperformance in growth means there will be fewer than
400 stocks in the Russell 1000 growth index, according to
Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis in New York, who
estimates the top five names will account for over 44% of the
weighting.
""All the top names keep getting a chunkier and chunkier
proportion,"" said DeSanctis.
In addition, the weightings in the Russell 2000 growth will
shift and DeSanctis anticipates a 4.6% decrease in tech's
weighting while health care will gain 3.4%.
The Russell 1000 growth index is expected to have about
two-thirds of its components in just technology and
communication services, said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior
portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee
Falls, Wisconsin.
Meanwhile, about 45 stocks are leaving the growth index,
reducing the index to just over 390 names, compared to roughly
870 in the counterpart value index, VanCronkhite said.
""It becomes much more challenging to beat benchmarks when
you have fewer tools in the toolbox,"" VanCronkhite said. ""If you
have a smaller number of names, you may have fewer options to
construct the ideal portfolio.""
While some index providers choose to constantly refresh
their indexes to keep a fixed amount of components in them, FTSE
Russell only reconstitutes once per year, with the exception of
adding initial public offerings on a quarterly basis.
Because the reconstitution is well telegraphed every year,
it also creates additional demand for buying and selling stocks
as some investors may see the additional liquidity as an
opportunity to take advantage of any price dislocations that may
result.
At the June 2023 reconstitution, $72.7 billion and $61.7
billion in U.S. stocks traded in the closing moments of Friday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq exchanges,
respectively, according to FTSE Russell.
Due to the concentration in the mega cap growth stocks such
as Nvidia this year, the typical large cap growth manager is
underweight by the top ten benchmark stocks by 16.7%, UBS senior
U.S. equity strategist Patrick Palfrey estimated in a report
late last month. Palfrey expects the top 10 company weights in
the Russell 1000 growth index to increase from 56.1% to 61.3%
after the refresh.
""In theory, the increase in concentration from the rebalance
would create buying pressure in these stocks, in practice, the
impact should be mitigated by portfolio diversification rules,""
the UBS analysts said in the report to clients, noting this
should increase tracking error among growth managers.
As of December 2023, approximately $10.5 trillion in assets
were benchmarked to the Russell U.S. indexes and $15.9 trillion
globally. While Russell has begun offering indexes that either
cap the weight of the largest market cap stocks or exclude them,
there are no plans to adjust the methodology of the indexes to
account for the market concentration.
""We're here as an index provider to reflect the market.
That's what we're hearing consistently from our clients that
they want,"" said Catherine Yoshimoto, Director of Product
Management for the Russell US Indexes at FTSE Russell.
""And for those who have other needs, we are figuring out
solutions that could work for them, like the capped indexes or
exclusion indexes or different segmentations of the market.""

32,Anglo American Reportedly Sets Up for AUD 7.5 Billion Coal Exit,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/CORONADO-GLOBAL-RESOURCES-46749711/news/Anglo-American-Reportedly-Sets-Up-for-AUD-7-5-Billion-Coal-Exit-47030352/,CRN,Jun. 24,S&P Capital IQ,"Anglo American plc (LSE:AAL) is expected to appoint an investment bank any day for a sale of its $5 billion (AUD 7.5 billion) portfolio of Australian coalmining assets, according to sources in the market. The sale, which comes after an announced company break-up while it has been fending off advances from BHP, will involve big dollars for what are some of the best metallurgical coal mines in the world. That may limit the field somewhat.
One of the parties most strongly positioned for the portfolio is BHP itself, but perhaps it does not want to be seen to be reinforcing Anglo American's break-up strategy that enhances Anglo's value. But sources say BHP will not be in contention for the mines. If the break-up of Anglo American does not go well, it's always been considered a possibility that BHP comes back a second time with an ""all of company"" bid for Anglo American after several months.
The bet by some is that the coal auction attracts non-conforming offers. China-backed Yancoal Australia Ltd. (ASX:YAL) will probably bid for Anglo American's Capcoal and Dawson assets, while Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC), Coronado Global Resources Inc. (ASX:CRN) and Stanmore Resources Limited could bid for the other more attractive mines, Moranbah North and Grosvenor. Other assets that form part of the Queensland portfolio are the Aquila project, an interest in Jellinbah and the potential Moranbah South project, producing about 16 million tonnes a year.
Glencore would also be large enough to buy the mines, but the Swiss trader is yet to complete its acquisition of Teck Resources, so could be distracted with that. Other than that, it's hard to see what other groups would be well placed to buy the entire portfolio, with Whitehaven Coal busy digesting the coal mines it has only just bought from BHP. There's been a view that perhaps the reason why BHP sold its Daunia and Blackwater coal mines in the first place was to make way for the Anglo American assets it would inherit as part of its planned buyout, clearing any challenges it may face owning both from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission.
In terms of selecting an investment bank, Anglo American has used Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as its defence advisers so both could be well-placed."

(NYSE:SPR) for about $35 a share in a deal funded mostly with stock, according to people familiar with the matter. The latest proposal represents a switch from Boeing?s plan to fund an all-cash offer after months of talks between the companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential matter. A $35 per share price would represent a premium of about 6% to Spirit?s stock as of Monday?s close, suggesting an equity valuation of $4.1 billion.
It?s also a 22% upside to its closing price on February 29, the day before Boeing?s takeover talks became public. A Boeing representative declined to comment on the decision to move to an all-stock deal, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. ?We continue to focus on the providing the best quality products for our customers,?
said Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit. The change in currency for the outlay should ease some of the squeeze on the cash-strapped planemaker, the people said. Final terms are still being hammered out and could include a small amount of cash, they said.
?We await more details, but we see the $35/share mark as a reasonable outcome for both parties,? Stifel analyst Bert W. Subin said in a note to clients. Boeing?s decision to revise the payment terms is the latest twist in an unusually complex transaction, which will also require Spirit to spin off some of its manufacturing plants to Airbus SE (ENXTPA:AIR).
The switch will require more due diligence, but isn?t seen as a deal-killer. The three-way transaction is still expected to be announced within a matter of days, said the people. Shares of Spirit slid 4% to $31.75 in premarket US trading on June 25, 2024.
They had gained 4.1% year-to-date on anticipation of a sale, despite financial distress that has required financial aid from its two biggest customers."

The deal marks a shift by the large mall owner, which has traditionally worked with big institutions to buy malls. By joining with the bank it is now tapping private capital that wants to directly own shopping centres, opening up a new pool of investors.
The transaction also shows that large institutions that own malls are seeing value in them, following a fall in values triggered by higher interest rates and Covid-19. Scentre and Barrenjoey made their move on the stake in the mall in April by launching an unlisted trust to own a half interest in the property, Adelaide's second largest mall. Their surprise move effectively thwarted a transaction that would have resulted in acquisitive funds house IP Generation purchasing the stake in the mall from the Dexus-managed fund selling it.
The move not only signals Scentre's entry into funds but this is expected to continue as more centres come up given the offer was oversubscribed. The deal also shows the large pricing recalibration of regional shopping centre assets since the boom times before the pandemic. Scentre Group Chief Executive Elliott Rusanow said the group had successfully partnered with Barrenjoey Private Capital to establish a fund to purchase a 50% share in Westfield Tea Tree Plaza and the adjoining Tea Tree Plus.
""The opportunity was oversubscribed, reflecting the strong demand from private investors to invest directly into one of our Westfield destinations,"" he said. ""The group has retained its 50% interest and will continue to drive the strong operating performance of the centre."" A Dexus spokesman confirmed the sale of the centre as part of the fund's proactive capital management strategy. The unlisted vehicle has been selling down assets to meet redemptions.
CBRE agent Simon Rooney negotiated the deal for the Dexus-managed fund as institutional and private capital flows back into the regional shopping centre market. The acquisition comes just weeks after the announcement of Vicinity Centre's agreement with the Future Fund to acquire its 50% interest in Lakeside Joondalup, Western Australia, with additional major retail transactions expected to be completed in coming months."

With a price gain of 6.25 percent to 77.35 euros, they were one of the favorites in the MDax, approaching their high for the year, which they had reached in May at 80.50 euros. For 2024, the share price is now back up by a good 4%.
A report in ""Manager Magazin"" entitled ""How major shareholder Salzgitter is expanding its power at Aurubis"" provided the share price with a tailwind on Thursday. The report discusses the search for a new Aurubis CEO, which is also proving difficult due to the ideas of Salzgitter CEO Gunnar Groebler. The steel producer holds just under 30 percent of the copper smelter and Groebler sits on Aurubis' Supervisory Board.
Groebler wanted a candidate with transformation experience in addition to other qualifications. According to the newspaper, this would give rise to suspicions at Aurubis that the Salzgitter boss wants to change the majority situation. Nevertheless, Salzgitter has repeated recent statements that it is not planning a takeover of Aurubis.
Last year, cases of fraud and theft weighed on Aurubis' business. The millions in losses also led to criticism of the Group's risk management. As a result, almost the entire Executive Board had to leave. Aurubis CEO Roland Harings, Chief Financial Officer Rainer Verhoeven and Chief Production Officer Heiko Arnold lost or resigned prematurely.
While Arnold already left Aurubis at the end of February, Harings is leaving on September 30. A successor has already been found for Verhoeven. Mercedes manager Steffen Hoffmann will take over the finance department when he joins the company on October 1./mis/ck/jha/"

The Hamburg-based company has consulted advisors in order to be prepared accordingly, according to sources close to the matter.
